## Squads
### Player
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Seer** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, time to cloak. All enemies are far (dist 3-5), none in range. Hawk at (4,1) is the priority target (striker = damage dealer). I'll cloak first, then advance toward Hawk to get into position for next turn. Moving to (4,2) puts me 1 tile from Hawk's current position — well within strike range next turn while cloaked.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(3,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-6, need ≤4). I need to advance to bring them into range. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Prophet at (3,5) — that would be dist 2, well within scan range. Valid moves include (3,3). I'll move there and then scan Prophet to reveal their prompt and deal damage.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Seer (enemy oracle) is in scan range at (3,3), distance 2. Scanning will reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. This is high priority intel on round 1. After scanning, I can move to maintain safe distance while staying behind front line.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Weaver is at dist 4, Prophet at dist 6. Moving north to (4,3) closes distance to Weaver to 2 tiles, putting them in precision_shot range. Orders say prioritize distance maintenance and precision_shot on high-value targets. Weaver (vector) denies precision_shot when adjacent, but at dist 2 I'm safe. Move to (4,3) then precision_shot Weaver at (5,4).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Allies Hawk and Seer are at (4,3) and (3,3). Prophet is at (2,5) directly north, distance 4. I need to advance toward the front line and position between allies and enemies. Moving to (2,3) puts me directly south of Prophet on the same column, closing distance while staying in front of allies. No enemies in range yet so ability isn't useful this turn.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent at dist=2, within my range. I should place a trap between enemy positions to control the approach. Moving to (4,4) puts me closer to the center and lets me place a trap on (3,4) which is between Seer/Rampart and my current position — a likely approach path. Hawk is already dist=2 from me, so I want to trap the corridor they'll use. Place trap at (3,3) where Seer currently stands would be blocked since they're there. Better to trap (3,4) as a chokepoint between enemies and allies.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Rampart 8/8, Seer 5/6, Weaver 8/9, Phantom 4/4, Prophet 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is already scanned. Rampart is unknown and close at dist=2, within scan range. Scanning Rampart gives intel and 1 damage. I'm already at a safe position at (2,5). Scan Rampart first, then stay put or reposition slightly. No need to move — scan Rampart from current position.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(4,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Weaver placed a trap at (3,4) last turn — I must avoid that tile. Prophet already scanned. Phantom is the priority scan target since it can cloak and become hard to track. Foresight shows Phantom moved to (4,2). I'm at (3,3). Phantom is at (4,2), distance=2, within scan range. I should scan Phantom now to get its prompt before it cloaks again. I can move first to stay safe from Weaver's trap at (3,4) — move to (3,2) to avoid trap, then scan Phantom at (4,2) from dist=2. That keeps me away from Weaver's denial range and the trap.
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(4,3) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, behind Hawk (facing N, I'm at 4,2 which is south of them). I can breach Hawk right now from my current position - I'm adjacent and behind. Orders say to breach sentinels, but also prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Hawk is a striker (damage dealer) and I'm already in breach position. I'll breach Hawk to take control, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked (cloak will drop after this turn anyway). Actually, breach doesn't deal damage - it makes them obey me. Better to shadow_strike Hawk for damage while still cloaked. Shadow_strike keeps cloak active, so I can hit Hawk for 1 damage. Or I could breach Hawk (the damage dealer) to waste their turn. Hawk is the striker/damage dealer - breaching them is high value. I'm already behind Hawk, breach is ready. After breach, I still need to move. I'll breach Hawk first, then move to get behind Seer for next turn. Actually, breach uses my ability slot. I'll breach Hawk (behind, adjacent, ready) then move toward Rampart for next turn positioning.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. I'm at (4,3) adjacent to Weaver's denial zone which blocks my abilities. Valid moves include (5,3) and (5,4) which move me toward the east edge and away from allies at (2,3) and (3,2). I'll move to (5,3) first, then (5,4) to reach the edge.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. Prophet is at (2,5) distance 2 — directly north. If I move to (2,4), Prophet becomes adjacent and I can attack. But moving loses fortify. Better to hold position and use shield_wall toward the north to protect against Prophet. Seer is at (3,2) to my south — I can shield_wall north to cover Prophet's direction. Actually, Prophet is at dist 2 north, not adjacent, so I can't attack. I should move toward Prophet to engage, or stay fortified. Staying fortified with shield_wall north gives strong defense. Let me move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Prophet and attack — losing fortify but dealing damage and pressuring the oracle.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent at (5,4), so my Denial passive is blocking some of his abilities. I'm at (4,4) with 8/9 HP. There's already a trap at (3,4). Priority: Hawk is the immediate threat at dist=1, so pulse will hit him for 1dmg. After pulsing, I should move to (3,5) to place a trap between Rampart/Seer and our allies, or stay and deny Hawk. Actually, pulse first from current position hits Hawk (dist=1). Then move to (5,5) to pull away while still denying, or move to (4,5) to get some distance. Wait - if I move first I lose denial on Hawk. Better to pulse first (hitting Hawk), then move to (4,5) or (5,5) to reposition. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Hawk at dist=1 gets hit. After pulse, move to (4,5) to shift position slightly while staying in control zone.
  State: Hawk 3/4, Rampart 7/8, Seer 5/6, Weaver 8/9, Phantom 3/4, Prophet 4/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(2,5) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,1) and has already been scanned — it's an assassin targeting our damage dealer (Hawk). Phantom used breach last turn and moved to (3,1), now adjacent to me. I need to move away to avoid Phantom's likely attack/cloak, while still contributing. Prophet is at range 4 — just barely out of scan range at current position, but if I move north I might close that gap. However, moving toward Prophet puts me closer to Phantom. Better to move away from Phantom to safety, then scan Prophet to deny their intel role. If I move to (2,3), that puts me at dist 3 from Prophet (2,5) — within scan range. And it moves me away from Phantom. Rampart is attacking (2,5) which is Prophet's position — good coordination opportunity. I'll move to (2,3) then scan Prophet to disrupt their scanning role and deal damage.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is the enemy oracle (damage dealer priority). I can reach (2,2) which is directly behind Seer at (2,3) facing N. Move there, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 3/6 HP. Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) and will attack me this turn per Foresight. Seer is at (2,3). Both are already scanned. I need to reposition away from danger - Rampart will attack (2,5) so I must move. Moving west or to (1,5) gets me away from Rampart. Hawk at (5,4) is just out of scan range (dist=4, not in range per recon). I should move to safety then scan Hawk to get intel. Moving to (1,5) puts me out of Rampart's attack range. From (1,5) Hawk is dist=5, still out of range. Let me move to (0,5) or (1,4) - from (1,4) Hawk is dist=4+1=5... I need to scan Hawk. From current position Hawk is dist=4 but out of range. Wait - recon says Hawk is out of range at dist=4. Let me recalibrate Phantom instead since I know enemy prompts. Phantom is at (2,2) - too far for recalibrate (adjacent only). Best move: reposition away from Rampart's attack at (2,5), move to (1,5) to escape, then scan Hawk if possible or wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver's denial zone which blocks my abilities. Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge. My allies are at (2,4) and (2,3), so I should move east/south toward the map edge. Valid moves include (5,2) and (5,3) which move me south along the east edge, away from allies. I'll move to (5,2) to get further from allies and toward the southern edge.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5), no enemies in range. Hawk is at (5,2) moving toward me from the south. I should move to (4,4) to get closer to the action, then place a trap at (4,3) to intercept Hawk's northward advance. There's already a trap at (3,4) blocking the western approach. A trap at (4,3) creates a chokepoint for Hawk moving north along column 5 or cutting west.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(1,5) ✓
  💭 Fortified at (2,4) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies adjacent to attack. Prophet is wounded at (1,5) — moving to (2,5) brings me adjacent and lets me attack. That breaks fortify but Prophet is a priority target. Seer is at (2,3) behind me and Phantom is at (2,2) — threat coming from south. After attacking Prophet I could shield_wall S to protect Seer from Phantom.
  State: Hawk 3/4, Rampart 7/8, Seer 4/6, Weaver 8/9, Phantom 3/4, Prophet 2/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(2,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Seer (I'm at 2,2, Seer is at 2,3 facing N — so I'm directly behind them). Breach is ready and I've only used 1/2. I should breach Seer to take control of the enemy oracle, which eliminates a threat and potentially turns their damage against their own team. After breaching, I'll have used my ability so no second ability. I can move first if needed, but I'm already in the perfect position — adjacent and behind Seer. Use breach on Seer now.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Hawk at (5,2). Phantom is adjacent at (2,4) and plans to shadow_strike me at (2,3) — I need to evade. Foresight shows Phantom will move to (2,2) then strike (2,3), so I should not stay at (2,3). Moving toward Hawk means heading east/south. Best move: (3,2) gets me away from Phantom's strike path and closer to Hawk. Then I can scan Weaver at (4,4) — dist from (3,2) to (4,4) is 3, within range 4. But Weaver at (4,4) is 3 tiles from current pos — if I move to (3,2), dist to Weaver is |4-3|+|4-2|=1+2=3, still in scan range and not adjacent so not blocked. Actually Weaver plans to trap (4,3), so scanning Weaver reveals their prompt. Let me move to (3,2) then scan Weaver.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Critical situation: I'm at 2/6 HP and Rampart is adjacent at (2,5) and will attack me this turn (Foresight confirms: Rampart move→(2,5) attack→(1,5)). Seer will also scan me at (2,5) next turn. I need to escape. My valid moves include (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — moving west/south gets me away from Rampart. If I move to (0,5) or (0,4), Rampart can't reach me (dist would be 2+). Best escape: move to (0,4) which puts me distance 2 from Rampart and out of Seer's scan range. After moving, I have no good scan targets in range (all enemies are out of range from (0,4)). I could recalibrate Phantom if adjacent but Phantom is at (2,4) — not adjacent from (0,4). Or I could wait as second action to preserve position. Actually, let me check: from (0,4), Rampart at (2,5) is dist=3, Seer at (2,3) after move would be dist=3 — still in scan range (≤4). I should scan Seer if possible. From (0,4), Seer moves to (2,3), dist = |0-2|+|4-3| = 3 ≤ 4, so scan works! But I only have 2 HP — taking 1 damage from scan would leave me at 1 HP. Seer's prompt is already known. Better to just flee and wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. I'm at (5,2). Allies are at (2,5) and (3,2). The map edge is x=5 or y=0. Moving to (5,4) gets me closer to the top-right edge and away from Seer at (3,2). Then I can move to (5,0) — wait, that's two separate moves. Valid moves include (5,4) and (5,0). Moving toward y=0 edge: (5,0) is available and moves me away from allies at (2,5) and (3,2). Or I could go (5,4) toward the top edge. Seer is at (3,2) same row as me — moving to (5,4) increases distance from Seer. Rampart is at (2,5). Moving to (5,4) keeps me on the right edge and away from allies. I'll move to (5,4) to hug the right/top edge area, away from allies.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent at (5,4) - I can attack it directly. I'm already denying its abilities. After attacking, I should move to (4,5) to avoid being flanked, or stay and pulse. Actually, pulse would only hit Hawk at dist=1. Let me attack Hawk first, then move to (3,5) to place myself between Rampart and allies while maintaining denial pressure. (4,3) has a trap already. Moving to (4,5) keeps me near Hawk for continued denial.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (2,4) — attack it. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. No need to move.
  State: Hawk 2/4, Rampart 7/8, Seer 4/6, Weaver 7/9, Phantom 2/4, Prophet 2/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Hawk at (5,2) to attack. I'm at (3,2), Hawk is at (5,4). (5,2) is a valid move tile and puts me closer to Hawk. However, I only have attack range adjacent - I'd need to be next to Hawk to attack. Hawk is at (5,4), so I need to reach (5,3) or (4,4) to be adjacent. Moving to (5,2) gets me 2 tiles away from Hawk. Let me move to (4,3) to close distance - wait, orders say move toward (5,2). I'll move to (5,2) as ordered, then I have no ability target in adjacent range from there. I'll wait as second action.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(2,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) facing N, and Rampart is at (2,5) — adjacent, directly to my north, and I'm already behind them (their back faces south toward me). Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer (Hawk), but Hawk is dist=3 and unreachable for melee this turn. I'm at 2HP, wounded. Rampart is healthy and adjacent — shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage. I should shadow_strike Rampart to chip damage while staying cloaked, then move toward Hawk for next turn positioning. After shadow_strike I can move to (4,4) to get closer to Hawk without stepping on traps at (3,4) or (4,3).
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → scan(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP — very low, need to survive. Foresight shows Rampart attacked (2,4) last turn, Hawk waited at (5,4). Seer moved toward (3,2) and scanned (4,4) — threatening our specter Phantom. I have Hawk out of scan range (dist=5). Rampart is in scan range (dist=3) but already scanned. Seer is far (dist=7). My priority: stay alive and provide intel. I should scan Hawk but can't reach range. I can recalibrate Phantom or Weaver if adjacent. Weaver is at (4,5) — not adjacent to me at (0,4). Phantom is at (4,4) — not adjacent. No adjacent allies. I can move toward Hawk to get scan range, but that's risky at 2HP. Best play: move to (3,4) — wait, that's a trap. Move to (2,4) gets me closer to Rampart/action but risky. Move to (1,4) keeps me safer. From (1,4), Hawk is still dist=4+... (5,4) to (1,4) = 4 tiles, exactly in scan range! Then scan Hawk to reveal prompt and deal 1dmg.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and adjacent at (4,4) — priority target. I'm at 1HP so staying safe is critical. Weaver is 2 tiles away at (4,5), so precision_shot is blocked if I'm adjacent to Weaver but I'm not adjacent currently. Phantom is at dist=1 (adjacent), which means precision_shot is blocked against Phantom (needs LoS and I need range≤2, but Phantom is adjacent — wait, the block is Vector adjacency not target adjacency). Phantom is adjacent so I can use attack(1dmg) or precision_shot(2dmg, range≤2). Weaver is a vector — I must not move adjacent to Weaver. Moving to (5,3) keeps distance from Weaver(4,5) at dist=2+, and then I can precision_shot Phantom(4,4) from (5,3) at dist=~1.4 which is ≤2. Actually from current pos (5,4), Phantom is at dist=1, Weaver is at dist=2 — precision_shot not blocked since Weaver is not adjacent to me. Use precision_shot on Phantom (wounded, dist=1) for 2dmg to finish them, then move to (5,3) to increase distance from Weaver.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,5) with 6/8 HP. No enemies in attack range. Prophet is at (1,4) dist=2 - wounded and closest threat. Weaver at (4,5) dist=2, Phantom at (4,4) dist=3. Hawk is critical at (5,3). I should move to (3,4) to close on Phantom/Weaver and position between allies and enemies, but that puts me adjacent to Weaver's denial zone. Moving to (3,5) keeps me on the line without entering Weaver's adjacency. From (3,5) I'd be dist=1 from Weaver at (4,5) - that's adjacent, blocked. Better to move to (2,4) to get closer to Prophet at (1,4) - dist=1, that puts me adjacent and I can attack. Move to (2,4) then attack Prophet.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → pulse(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both allies are critical and need protection. Traps are already at (3,4) and (4,3) creating some denial. Hawk is at (5,3) critical and dangerous. I should move to (5,4) to get adjacent to Hawk - this denies their abilities via my passive and puts me in position. Then I can pulse to hit Hawk (and possibly others nearby). Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,3). Pulse from (5,4) hits all units within 1 tile - Hawk is at dist=1, so pulse hits Hawk for 1dmg which could finish them if critical.
  State: Rampart 6/8, Seer 4/6, Weaver 7/9, Prophet 1/6 | Dead: Hawk, Phantom

### Turn 6 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 4/6 HP. Orders say move toward Hawk at (5,2) to attack my ally — but I AM at (5,2), so Hawk must be nearby or this is the destination. Foresight shows Hawk used precision_shot at (4,4) last turn and moved to (5,3). Weaver is at (5,4), 2 tiles away — I must stay non-adjacent to avoid scan block. Prophet is at (1,4), critical HP, out of scan range. My best play: move to (4,2) to reposition away from Weaver while staying safe, then scan Prophet if possible — but Prophet is at distance 6, out of range 4. Rampart is attacking Prophet at (1,4). I should stay at range and wait, or move toward Prophet to scan. But orders say attack Hawk. Foresight shows Hawk moved to (5,3) last turn. If Hawk is now at (5,3), I could move adjacent and attack. Moving to (5,3) would put me adjacent to Weaver at (5,4) — bad, scan gets blocked. Move to (4,3) instead — that gets me closer to Hawk's likely position without being adjacent to Weaver. From (4,3) I can't attack (1 tile = adjacent only). I'll move to (4,3) and wait — positioning for next turn.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → scan(4,3) ✗ Out of range (max 4)
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) and attacked me last turn. Foresight shows Rampart moved to (2,4) then attacked (1,4) — they'll likely attack again. I must flee immediately. Move away from Rampart first. Valid moves include (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (0,3) etc. I should move to (0,5) or (0,4) to escape Rampart's melee range. Seer is at (4,3) distance 4 from current position but if I move away they'll be out of range. After moving, I can try to recalibrate Weaver if adjacent, but Weaver is at (5,4) — too far. Best play: move to (0,5) to escape Rampart, then wait or scan if range permits. Actually from (0,5) Seer at (4,3) would be dist=sqrt(16+4)=~4.5, out of range. From (1,5) Seer dist=sqrt(9+4)=~3.6, in range (≤4). Move to (1,5) to escape Rampart (dist=2, safe) and keep Seer in scan range. Then scan Seer — already know prompt but scan deals 1 damage to wounded Seer, potentially finishing them.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(1,5) ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (2,4) with 50% damage reduction. Prophet is critical at (1,5) distance 2 — if I move to (1,4) or (2,5) I could get adjacent. Weaver is healthy at (5,4) distance 3. Seer is wounded at (4,3). My orders are to hold the front line between allies and enemies. Moving to (2,5) puts me adjacent to Prophet at (1,5) — I can attack the critical Prophet and potentially finish them. This is worth losing fortify since Prophet is almost dead. Move to (2,5) then attack Prophet at (1,5).
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded at (4,3), distance 2 - within range. I can attack Seer to finish them off or apply pressure. My position (5,4) facing S. Trap at (3,4) already placed. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to Seer at (4,3), enabling attack and denial. Alternatively, stay and attack Seer from (5,4) - dist 2 is within attack range? No, attack is adjacent only (range 1). I need to move closer. Move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Seer, then attack. (4,4) is in my valid moves. This also puts me in denial range of Seer, blocking their oracle abilities.
  State: Rampart 6/8, Seer 2/6, Weaver 7/9 | Dead: Hawk, Phantom, Prophet

### Turn 7 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, adjacent to Weaver which blocks my scan ability. I need to escape the denial zone first. Moving to (4,5) puts distance from Weaver while staying on the board. After moving, I'm no longer adjacent to Weaver so I could scan, but Weaver is now 2 tiles away at (4,4) — still within range 4. Actually let me move to (5,4) to escape denial and get scan range. Wait — valid moves include (4,5) and (5,4) and (5,5). Moving to (5,5) gets me away from Weaver. After moving to (5,5), Weaver at (4,4) is dist ~1.4 tiles — still adjacent. Let me check: (4,5) puts me 1 tile from Weaver at (4,4). (5,4) puts me at dist ~1.4 from (4,4). (5,5) puts me at dist ~1.4. None of these fully escape adjacency with Weaver. Best bet: move to (3,3) — dist from (4,4) is ~1.4, still adjacent. Actually I should prioritize survival — I'm at 2HP. Move away from Weaver toward safety near Rampart at (2,5). Move to (3,5) gets me closer to Rampart and away from Weaver (dist from (4,4) ~1.4). Wait, (3,5) is in valid moves. Distance from (3,5) to (4,4) = sqrt(1+1) = 1.41 — still adjacent? Adjacency is typically 1 tile. So only exactly 1 apart counts. (3,5) to (4,4): not same row/col, so not adjacent in cardinal sense. I'll move to (3,5) to escape denial zone, then scan Weaver.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Seer (oracle) is wounded at (3,5) and within range 2. I can attack Seer directly. There's already a trap at (3,4). I should move closer to apply Denial to Seer and block oracle abilities, then attack. Moving to (3,4) is blocked by trap. Move to (4,5) gets me adjacent to Seer at (3,5) - that puts Denial on Seer blocking scan/precision_shot. Then attack Seer to finish them off.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,5) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,5) with 50% damage reduction active. Seer is critical at (3,5) and needs protection. Weaver is at (4,5) — 2 tiles away, so I can't move adjacent without triggering denial. I should hold position to keep fortify active and use shield_wall toward the east (toward Weaver) to protect Seer from incoming damage.
  State: Rampart 6/8, Seer 1/6, Weaver 6/9 | Dead: Hawk, Phantom, Prophet

### Turn 8 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP and adjacent to Weaver whose DENIAL blocks my scan ability. I need to escape immediately. Move away from Weaver first, then I can scan from safety. Best escape is (3,4) to break adjacency, then scan Weaver or another enemy. Actually moving to (3,3) or (4,3) gives more distance. Let me move to (3,3) to break denial zone, then scan Weaver at dist 2 from there — wait, I have spd3 so I can move up to 3 tiles. Move to (3,2) to get far from Weaver at (4,5), dist would be ~3. From (3,2): dist to Weaver(4,5) = 1+3=4, within scan range. That breaks denial and lets me scan.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → pulse(3,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at dist=2 to my north-west. I'm at (4,5). Trap at (3,4) already placed. Seer is critical at (3,2) but out of range. Rampart is healthy and close. I should move toward Seer to pressure them while placing a trap on a chokepoint. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Rampart (dist=1) enabling Denial and pulse. From (3,5) I can pulse Rampart for 1 damage. Let me move to (3,5) then pulse targeting Rampart at (2,5) — pulse hits all within 1 tile of target tile, so I target myself/adjacent. Actually pulse hits all units within 1 tile of ME. From (3,5), Rampart at (2,5) is dist=1, so pulse would hit them. That's good pressure.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, adjacent to wounded Weaver. Seer is critical and needs protection. I should attack Weaver now while adjacent and maintain fortify by not moving — keeping pressure on the enemy while staying tanky. Not moving preserves Fortify passive.
  State: Rampart 5/8, Seer 1/6, Weaver 4/9 | Dead: Hawk, Phantom, Prophet

### Turn 9 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Weaver is wounded at (3,5), 3 tiles away. I already have Weaver's prompt. Foresight shows Weaver will pulse at (3,5) this turn — that's an AoE centered on themselves. I'm at (3,2), 3 tiles away, so pulse likely won't reach me. Rampart is attacking Weaver. My priority is survival — stay at range, don't move adjacent to Weaver. I could scan Weaver again but prompt is already known. Better to recalibrate Rampart... but Rampart is at (2,5), not adjacent to me at (3,2). Distance is 3 tiles — out of recalibrate range. I can't attack from range either. Best move: reposition safely and wait. Moving to (2,2) or staying put. Weaver's pulse is centered on (3,5) — if pulse radius is 1, it hits (3,4),(2,5),(4,5),(3,5). Rampart at (2,5) could be hit. I should recalibrate Rampart but can't reach adjacency safely without getting close to Weaver. Stay put and wait — at 1HP I must not risk anything.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver (wounded) and fortified with 50% damage reduction. DENIAL zone means only basic attack/movement work. Seer is critical at (3,2) - I should attack Weaver to finish them off since they're wounded, then hold position to maintain fortify bonus next turn.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(3,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 3HP, adjacent to Rampart at (2,5). There's already a trap at (3,4). Rampart is adjacent so I can't use trap (Vector passive blocks it). I should pulse to hit Rampart for 1dmg since it's within 1 tile. Then move away to avoid retaliation. Moving to (4,5) gets me away from Rampart while staying on the field. Seer is critical at dist 3, out of range.
  State: Rampart 4/8, Seer 1/6, Weaver 3/9 | Dead: Hawk, Phantom, Prophet

### Turn 10 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → recalibrate(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — survival is critical. Weaver is at (4,5), dist 4, just barely out of scan range. I already know Weaver's prompt. Rampart is at (2,5) wounded. Weaver pulsed toward (3,5) last turn, so it may threaten that area again. I should move north toward (3,5) to get adjacent to Weaver for a scan... but at 1HP that's suicidal. Better to recalibrate Rampart — I need to move adjacent to (2,5). From (3,2), moving to (3,4) or (2,4) gets me closer. Move to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (2,5), then recalibrate with tactical advice about Weaver's trap-and-pulse strategy so Rampart can act accordingly.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,4) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is 2 tiles away at (4,5), wounded. I'm at (2,5) fortified with 4/8 HP. Seer is critical at (2,4). I need to press the flank on wounded Weaver. Moving to (3,5) gets me adjacent to Weaver but order warns to avoid (3,5) due to trap choke. Moving to (3,4) keeps me off the trap tile and positions me to attack. Wait — valid moves include (3,4) and (3,5). I'll move to (3,4) to approach from the side, avoiding the trap at (3,5). From (3,4) Weaver at (4,5) is still not adjacent (dist ~1.4, diagonal). Actually let me reconsider: from (3,5) Weaver at (4,5) would be adjacent (dist=1, east). But orders say avoid clustering near (3,5). Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist ~1.4 from Weaver — not adjacent. I'll move to (3,5) despite warning to get adjacent and attack — Weaver is wounded and this could finish them. On second thought, orders explicitly warn against (3,5). Move to (3,4) and wait — I lose fortify but position well. Actually staying put preserves fortify and 50% damage reduction which matters at 4HP. I'll wait to maintain fortify and shield_wall toward E to protect Seer if Weaver advances.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → attack(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 3HP, wounded but still active. Rampart is at (2,5) wounded and in range (dist=2). Seer is critical at (2,4) but out of range. I have a trap at (3,4). My priority: pulse Rampart since they're adjacent enough (dist=2 means within 1 tile? No, pulse is 1-tile AoE so I need dist≤1). Rampart is dist=2 so pulse won't hit. I can attack Rampart (dist=2, but attack is adjacent only - so no). I need to close distance. Move to (3,5) to get adjacent to Rampart at (2,5), then attack. Or move to (3,5) and pulse to hit both Rampart (2,5) and Seer (2,4) if they're within 1 tile of (3,5). From (3,5): Rampart at (2,5) is dist=1 (adjacent), Seer at (2,4) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, not within 1 tile. So pulse from (3,5) hits Rampart. But note (3,4) has my trap - moving to (3,4) is listed as valid but has a trap there. Better to move to (3,5) and pulse Rampart, or attack. Attack requires adjacent. From (3,5), Rampart at (2,5) is adjacent. Move to (3,5), then attack Rampart (1dmg, they're wounded so this could finish them). Actually pulse from (3,5) hits all within 1 tile = Rampart at (2,5) for 1dmg. Attack also 1dmg. Either works. Let me move to (3,5) then attack Rampart to deal damage.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(2,5) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Weaver is at (3,5), 2 tiles away and wounded. Foresight shows Weaver will move to (3,5) then attack (2,5) — targeting Rampart. I already have Weaver's prompt. I should recalibrate Rampart at (2,5) to warn them about Weaver's incoming attack. Rampart is adjacent to me. I can move away from Weaver's threat range first, then recalibrate. Actually, Rampart is at (2,5) which is adjacent — I can recalibrate now. Moving away first risks losing adjacency. Let me recalibrate Rampart first to give them intel about Weaver's attack plan, then move to safety at (1,3) or further.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (3,5) and wounded. I'm at 3/8 HP but fortified with 50% damage reduction. DENIAL is active so my abilities may be blocked, but basic attack should still work. Weaver will attack me this turn. Best move: attack Weaver now to finish them off while wounded. I can attack from current position since they're adjacent. I should stay put to maintain Fortify bonus, then attack.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(2,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP - critically low. Rampart is adjacent at (2,5) wounded. I need to either finish Rampart or escape. Pulse would hit Rampart for 1dmg (and me too, but I'd take 1 self-damage). Attack does 1dmg at adjacent. Rampart is wounded - if I can kill it, that's priority. But I only have 2HP. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile including me - risky at 2HP. Attack is safer (no self-damage). After attacking, I should move away from Rampart to avoid being finished off. Move to (4,5) to create distance, then attack - wait, I need to check order. If I attack first then move: attack Rampart (1dmg), then move to (4,5) to escape. Or move first to (4,5) - but then Rampart is out of attack range (dist would be 2). Better to attack first while adjacent, then move away.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → recalibrate(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — survival is critical. Weaver is at (4,5), distance 5, out of scan range. Rampart is critical at (2,5). Foresight shows Weaver attacked Rampart last turn. I have no valid ability targets this turn. I should move to safety — away from Weaver and protect myself. Moving to (0,5) gets me away from danger while staying near Rampart for potential recalibrate next turn. Actually, recalibrate is adjacent only, so I need to be next to Rampart at (2,5). (1,5) is adjacent to Rampart and reachable. But Weaver is at (4,5) — being on row 5 puts me closer to Weaver. Better to recalibrate Rampart since they're critical. Move to (1,5) — adjacent to Rampart at (2,5), then recalibrate Rampart with tactical addendum.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → pulse(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 2HP - critical condition. Rampart is adjacent at dist=2 and critical too. I have a trap at (3,4). I need to stay alive and deal damage. I can attack Rampart at (2,5) from current position (dist=2, within range 2). But I should also consider positioning. Moving to (3,5) puts me dist=1 from Rampart, enabling pulse for 1dmg to all within 1 tile - but that risks adjacency. Better to attack from current position at range 2, and consider moving to safer ground. Actually, attack hits at range=adjacent only (1 tile). Pulse hits all within 1 tile AoE. Rampart is at dist=2 - not in pulse range from current pos. I can move to (3,5) to be adjacent to Rampart (dist=1), then pulse to hit Rampart for 1dmg (could finish a critical unit). But moving adjacent risks counter-attack. Alternatively, stay and place a trap between enemies. Seer is at (1,5) moving toward us. A trap at (2,5) would be blocked since Rampart is there. Trap at (3,5) could catch movement. Actually with 2HP I need to eliminate threats fast. Move to (3,5), then pulse - Rampart at (2,5) is within 1 tile, deals 1dmg. If Rampart is critical that may finish them.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, fortified, adjacent to Weaver who is critical. My denial zone blocks abilities but basic attack still works. Weaver is at dist=1 so I can attack. Attacking now could eliminate Weaver. I should attack first, then wait to keep fortify bonus since moving would lose it.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → recalibrate(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Weaver is at (3,5), 2 tiles away and critical. Rampart attacked Weaver last turn. I already have Weaver's prompt. I should NOT move adjacent to Weaver (would be blocked). I can move to (0,5) or (0,4) to create distance and safety. Recalibrate on Rampart at (2,5) - adjacent to me - to give tactical guidance since Rampart is critical and needs help. Move away first to stay safe, then recalibrate Rampart.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(2,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical danger. Rampart is adjacent at (2,5) and critical too. I need to survive. I can't place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector restriction doesn't apply here (I'm Vector, Rampart is sentinel). Actually trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not when I'm adjacent to enemies in general. But Rampart is adjacent at dist=1. My best move: attack Rampart to try to finish them (they're critical), then move away. Or move first to get distance from Rampart, then trap. If I attack Rampart they might die. Let me attack first (they're critical = low HP), then move to safety. Attack is adjacent only - Rampart is at dist=1 so in range.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical condition. Weaver is at (4,5), dist 4, just out of scan range. Foresight shows Weaver attacked (2,5) last turn and moved to (4,5). I need to survive. Moving toward Weaver risks denial and death. Best play: move away or hold position. Weaver has spd1 so can only move 1 tile. If I move to (3,5), Weaver could reach me next turn. Stay at range and wait — I can't scan (out of range), can't recalibrate without adjacent ally. Weaver at spd1 will take time to close. Move west is blocked (already at x=0). I can move south to (0,4) or (0,3) to create distance. Actually Weaver is to the east at x=4 — moving south doesn't help much. Best: wait or move to maintain distance. Weaver moves 1/turn from (4,5), so next turn at (3,5). I should stay at (0,5) or move south. With 1HP any hit kills me. Wait and hope round ends or ally handles it.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 1HP — critical condition. Seer is at (0,4), distance 5, out of range. There's a trap at (3,4). I need to stay alive and reposition. Moving toward (5,5) keeps me away from the trap at (3,4) and the enemy. I can place a trap at (3,5) to cover the approach path from the Seer's direction.
  State: Seer 1/6, Weaver 1/9 | Dead: Hawk, Rampart, Phantom, Prophet

### Turn 15 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical condition. Weaver is at (5,5), distance 6, out of scan range. No enemies are adjacent so I'm not in immediate danger. Weaver has a trap at (3,5) blocking that path. I should move away to safety and wait — I cannot reach Weaver to scan, and attacking isn't viable at 1HP. Best to move south toward cover and wait out the round.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 1HP - critically wounded. Seer is at (0,3), distance 7, out of range. Traps already at (3,4) and (3,5) covering the approach. Valid moves: [3,5],[4,4],[4,5],[5,3],[5,4]. I need to stay alive and maintain area denial. Moving to (4,4) keeps me mobile and away from the existing traps. I can't place a trap at (3,5) - already has one. I'll move to (4,4) to reposition, then place a trap at (4,5) to cover another approach vector while staying out of danger.

### Turn 16 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP critical - survival is paramount. Weaver is at (4,4) distance 5, out of scan range (max 4). No enemies adjacent so no immediate threat. Foresight shows Weaver placed a trap at (4,5) last turn. I should reposition to stay safe while keeping options open. Moving closer risks entering trap range. I'll move to (1,3) to slightly close distance without overcommitting, then wait since I have no valid targets in range.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. Seer is at (1,3) distance 4, moving east. I have traps at (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) already placed. I should move to close distance and place another trap to create more denial zones. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer and lets me place a trap at (2,3) to block Seer's path. But at 1HP I need to be cautious. Let me move toward the enemy but stay safe - move to (3,3) and place trap at (2,4) to create a barrier along their likely advance route.

### Turn 17 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 1HP — critical danger. Weaver is at (3,3), 2 tiles away and critical. Foresight shows Weaver will move to (3,3) and place a trap at (2,3) this turn. I must NOT move to (2,3) or adjacent to Weaver. I already have Weaver's prompt from scan. With 1HP I need to stay alive. Best move: reposition to (1,5) or (0,5) to get distance from the trap at (2,3) and stay out of adjacent range. Move to (0,5) puts me far from Weaver and the incoming trap. Then wait — I have no useful ability targets at safe range (scan already done on Weaver, no allies to recalibrate nearby).
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 1HP - critically low. Seer is at (0,5) dist=5, out of range. I have traps at (3,4),(3,5),(4,5),(2,3) already placed forming a barrier. My priority is survival. I should move away from danger while maintaining trap coverage. Moving to (4,3) keeps me safe and I can place a trap at (4,4) to extend the trap network eastward, covering more approach routes. Actually, with 1HP I need to be very careful. The Seer is approaching from north. I'll move to (5,3) to get further from traps and place another trap to extend coverage.
