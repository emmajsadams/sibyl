## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Snare** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Snare vector at (2,4) is the priority target for breach later. Move north to (2,3) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, tip says to cloak. Enemies are far away (dist 7 and 9). I'll cloak first, then move toward Hawk at (3,1) to close distance while invisible.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 4-5). Need to advance to get Snare in range. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer while staying away from the enemy Vector's denial range (adjacent only). From (3,3) Snare at (2,4) would be dist 2 — in precision_shot range. I'll move forward and then fire.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far north. I should advance and place a trap in a chokepoint between enemy positions and my allies. Moving to (4,2) puts me closer to center. From there I can place a trap at (3,3) or nearby - but (3,3) is where Hawk is. Better to place trap at (4,2) after moving there, or move to (3,1) and trap (3,3) area. Actually, move to (4,2) first, then place trap at (3,2) - that's between my allies at y=3 and enemies advancing from y=4-5. Trap at (3,2) would threaten enemies moving south through center.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Advance toward Hawk at (3,3) — move to (3,4) closes distance. Enemies are to my south/southeast, so shield_wall facing S protects allies behind me.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (3,3) just 2 tiles away moving north toward us. I should place a trap on a tile Hawk is likely to move through. Hawk is moving north from (3,3), so (3,4) or (3,5) are likely paths. However, (3,4) is where Aegis is standing. (3,5) is a valid move tile and a likely path if Hawk advances north. I'll move to (2,3) first to get a better angle, then place a trap at (3,4) — wait, Aegis is there. Better to place trap at (2,3) or along Hawk's advance route. Actually, I should place the trap first from current position (2,4), targeting (3,3) where Hawk currently stands or (3,4). Hawk is at (3,3) and moving N — likely next position is (3,4) or (2,3). I'll place trap at (3,3) (Hawk's current tile — but that's occupied). Traps go on empty tiles. Hawk may move to (2,3) or (3,4). I'll trap (3,4) since that's a natural advance north for Hawk (even though Aegis is there — wait, Aegis is at (3,4)). Let me trap (2,3) as a fallback path, then move to (2,3) — no, can't move there if trap is placed. Place trap at (3,3) — occupied. Place trap at (4,4) as Snare might advance. Actually best: trap at (3,5) to intercept Hawk moving north, then move to (1,4) to stay safe.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Wraith 4/4, Snare 7/7, Aegis 12/12, Snare 6/7, Phantom 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Hawk is at (3,3) facing N, and I can reach (3,2) which is directly behind Hawk. That's my breach tile. I'll move to (3,2) and then breach Hawk from behind to take control of them next turn. This is high value — striker under my control could devastate their team.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(1,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. The enemy Snare(vector) at (1,4) is facing W, and I'm already behind it — (2,4) is a valid behind tile I can reach. I should move to (2,4) and use breach on Snare to take control of it. Snare is dangerous (denial range blocks my cloak/breach when adjacent), but breach requires being BEHIND the enemy — and I'm not adjacent yet, so cloak isn't blocked. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent and behind Snare. Then I can breach it. This neutralizes the biggest threat (vector denial) and gives me a controlled unit.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) — precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2 but is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Aegis is a sentinel, not a vector, so precision_shot should work. However, Aegis is only 1 tile away (adjacent), which means I can use attack (1dmg, adjacent only). But precision_shot does 2dmg at range ≤2 with LoS — Aegis is adjacent so I can use it for 2dmg. My ally Snare(vector) is at (4,2), 3 tiles away — not adjacent, so no blocking. Move to (4,4) to stay at range 1-2 from Aegis but get slight positioning, then precision_shot Aegis for 2dmg. Actually, staying at (3,3) and using precision_shot on Aegis at (3,4) is cleanest — Aegis is adjacent (dist=1), not a Vector, so precision_shot fires for 2dmg if I haven't moved. Then move away to (3,1) to create distance.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Hawk is at (3,1) due south, Snare enemy at (4,2) also to the south/southeast. Moving south toward them loses fortify but advances. I should move to (3,3) to close distance toward Hawk at (3,1), then use shield_wall facing South since both enemies are to my south.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(3,2) ✗ Position occupied → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis sentinel is at (3,3), distance 2 - within trap range. I'm at (4,2). I should place a trap on a tile between Aegis and my allies to control movement. (3,2) is adjacent to Aegis and within my range - placing a trap there cuts off a key movement path. Then I can move to (5,2) to maintain distance while staying in range to threaten with pulse if enemies cluster.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,4) ✗ Position occupied → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. I need to advance and place traps on likely enemy movement paths. Hawk is at (3,1) moving toward our position, Snare at (5,2). The center tiles are likely chokepoints. I'll move to (2,4) to get closer and place a trap at (3,4) which is a natural approach path toward our allies.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Wraith 4/4, Snare 7/7, Aegis 11/12, Snare 6/7, Phantom 3/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, positioned behind Hawk at (3,1) who faces S. I'm already at (3,2) which is behind Hawk. I can use breach now while cloaked to take control of Hawk - this is a high-value strike since Hawk is a striker. Breach requires being behind the enemy, and I'm already there. After breach, Hawk will obey me next turn. I should breach Hawk immediately since cloak expires after this turn.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, adjacent to enemy Snare vector at (1,4) which is blocking my abilities (denial zone). I'm already behind Snare (facing W, I'm at 2,4 which is behind them). I can't use breach while adjacent to enemy Vector. But shadow_strike keeps cloak and works adjacent — however denial zone blocks abilities. Only basic attack/movement work in denial zone. I should move away from Snare's denial zone first, then use shadow_strike or breach. Moving to (3,4) puts me behind Aegis (sentinel facing S, behind tile is 3,4) and adjacent to them — perfect for shadow_strike or breach next. Cloak expires after this turn so I need to act now. Move to (3,4) to get behind Aegis, then shadow_strike to stay cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and attack my own teammate if adjacent. Wraith (ally specter) is at (3,4). Phantom (enemy specter) is adjacent at (3,2) - this blocks precision_shot. I should attack Phantom with basic attack since adjacent, then move away from allies toward a dangerous position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,4) to my north. I should attack it. I'm currently fortified (didn't move last turn), so I can attack and stay put to maintain fortify. Enemies are mostly to the north (Wraith at N, Hawk further away). I'll attack Wraith first, then use shield_wall facing North to block incoming damage.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and in range at dist=2. I can attack it now, then move to a chokepoint. Attacking Phantom (wounded) could finish or weaken it further. After attacking, move to (4,3) to place a trap between Aegis and allies on next turn, or stay and use pulse if clustered. Actually, best play: attack Phantom now (dist=2, in range), then move to (4,3) to control the corridor between Aegis at (3,3) and our position.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Wraith is wounded and only dist=2 away - within my range. I can attack for damage. Trap on (2,4) or (2,5) to cut off enemy movement paths. Wraith is at (3,4) moving west possibly, so (2,4) is a good trap spot. But I can't trap adjacent to an enemy - Wraith at (3,4) is dist=2 from me, not adjacent to me. Let me check: trap range is ≤2 tiles. (2,4) is 1 tile from me at (1,4), valid. Wraith is not adjacent to me so trap isn't blocked. Place trap at (2,4) to intercept Wraith if they move west, then attack Wraith directly since they're in range at dist=2.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Wraith 2/4, Snare 7/7, Aegis 10/12, Snare 6/7, Phantom 2/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(3,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP, currently behind Aegis (sentinel facing S, I'm at its behind tile). I can breach Aegis right now — I'm adjacent and behind. Breach is ready and would make Aegis obey me next turn, removing a dangerous healthy sentinel from the enemy team. Alternatively shadow_strike does 1dmg but keeps cloak. I'm not cloaked currently so shadow_strike still works (1dmg, adjacent). Aegis is healthy so breach is more valuable — turning a healthy sentinel against enemies is huge. After breach I should move to safety since I'm at 2HP. Move to (4,4) to get away from Snare's denial range while staying near the action.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 2HP, breach on cooldown. Wraith is wounded at (4,4) — high value target. I can reach (3,4) which is behind Wraith and adjacent. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1 damage. But I'm not cloaked right now. Enemy Snare vector at (4,3) would block cloak/breach if I get adjacent. If I move to (3,4), I'm adjacent to Snare at (4,3) — that blocks abilities. Hawk at (2,0) is healthy. Best play: move to (3,4) behind Wraith and use shadow_strike for 1 damage on wounded Wraith. Wait — (3,4) is adjacent to Snare at (4,3)? Distance from (3,4) to (4,3) = 1+1=2 tiles, not adjacent. So Snare denial only blocks if I'm adjacent (1 tile). (3,4) to (4,3): |4-3|+|3-4|=1+1=2. Not adjacent. So I can shadow_strike Wraith from (3,4). Wraith is wounded — this could finish or nearly finish them.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Orders say move away from allies and toward dangerous positions. Allies are at (4,4) and (4,3). I should move toward enemies. Best move is toward (4,0) or (3,1) to get closer to Aegis at (3,3). Moving to (4,0) gets me closer to the action.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive is blocking their abilities. Phantom is wounded at (3,4) distance 2. I can pulse to hit both Aegis and Phantom simultaneously (both within 1 tile of current position (4,3): Aegis at (3,3) is distance 1, Phantom at (3,4) is distance sqrt(2) which is within 1 tile AoE). Wait - pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile, and Wraith is at (4,4) which is adjacent - would hit ally. Better to attack Aegis directly for 1 damage, then move to (5,3) to deny Aegis while staying safe from Snare. Actually, Phantom is wounded - pulse would hit Aegis and Phantom but also Wraith at (4,4). Risk to Wraith who is critical makes pulse dangerous. Attack Aegis for 1 damage instead. Then move to (5,4) to reposition and potentially place trap on approach route next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical at (4,4), moving west likely. Snare is at (5,4). Tile (2,4) already has a trap. I should move to (2,3) or (2,5) to place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (2,5) puts me near (3,5) trap and I can place on (2,4) area - but (2,4) already trapped. Move to (1,3) and place trap at (2,4)... wait, (2,4) is already trapped. Wraith at (4,4) critical, likely to retreat or engage. If Wraith moves west along row 4, (3,4) is Phantom's position, so Wraith might go (3,5) or (3,3). Trap already at (3,5). Place trap at (2,3) to cover southern approach. Move to (2,5) first then trap (2,3)? Or move to (1,3) and trap (2,3). Let me move to (2,3) and place trap at (3,3) - path enemies might take toward our backline. Actually move to (1,5) and trap (2,5) to create a wall of traps along row 4-5 corridor.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Wraith at (4,4), dist=2. I need to get adjacent to attack. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Wraith at (4,4) — that's 1 tile north, in melee range. I must avoid traps at (3,5), (2,4), (2,3). (4,3) is a valid move and not a trap. Then attack Wraith at (4,4). Note: moving will lose Fortify, but attacking Wraith (critical HP) is priority.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Snare 7/7, Aegis 9/12, Snare 6/7, Phantom 2/4 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → breach(5,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Snare(vector) is at (5,4) facing N, and I can reach (5,3) which is behind it. Moving there lets me use breach to take control of the enemy vector — high value sabotage. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful, but breach doesn't break cloak and I have it ready. Move to (5,3), then breach Snare from behind. This uses my second breach charge on the enemy vector, which is a high-value target that can deny our own Snare's abilities.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward dangerous positions, attack own teammate if adjacent. My ally Snare is at (5,4). I should move away from Snare and toward enemy positions. Moving to (5,1) gets me closer to enemies while away from ally. No teammates adjacent so no self-attack possible.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(5,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and adjacent at (5,3). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - that hits Phantom directly and potentially Aegis at (4,3) which is dist 2 from me but only dist 1 from (4,4). I'm at (5,4). Pulse from current position hits (5,3) Phantom for 1dmg. Aegis is at (4,3), dist 2 from me - not in pulse range. After pulse, I should place a trap to control the area. Move to (4,4) first to get Aegis in denial range, then pulse would hit Phantom at (5,3) - wait, (5,3) to (4,4) is dist ~1.4, not adjacent. Let me think: stay at (5,4), pulse hits Phantom at (5,3) (dist=1, in range). Then move to (4,4) to deny Aegis abilities. Or pulse first then move. Pulse from (5,4): hits all within 1 tile = (4,4),(5,3),(5,5),(4,5) area. Phantom at (5,3) gets hit. Aegis at (4,3) is dist 2 from (5,4) - not in pulse range. So pulse Phantom now, then move to (4,4) to put Aegis in denial range.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is adjacent at (4,4) and in range. Orders say attack nearest enemy. I'm fortified so I should stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Snare with basic attack while staying fortified.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with traps already at (3,5), (2,4), and (2,3). Snare is at (4,4) moving west - likely heading toward our side. I should move east to close distance and place a trap on a tile Snare might move through. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer and lets me place a trap at (4,4) or nearby to intercept Snare's path. Actually, Snare is already at (4,4) so I should trap tiles they might move to: (3,4) or (4,3) where Aegis is. Let me move to (2,4) - wait, trap is already there. Move to (2,2) or advance to (3,3) and trap (4,4) area. From (3,3) I can reach trap range of 2 to hit (4,4) or (5,3) where Phantom is (friendly, skip). Better: move to (3,3), then place trap at (3,4) to block Snare's westward path.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Snare 6/7, Aegis 9/12, Snare 6/7, Phantom 1/4 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. Breach is ready and I'm currently behind Snare (vector at 4,4 facing W — I'm at 5,3 which is to the east/behind). I can move to 5,4 which is directly behind Snare and adjacent, then use breach to take control of that enemy vector. This is high value: Snare is a vector that blocks abilities, and breaching it would sabotage the enemy team while keeping me alive (breach doesn't damage me). Alternatively I could shadow_strike Hawk by moving to 5,0 (behind Hawk) but that's risky at 1HP. Breaching Snare (enemy vector) is the safest high-value play — it removes an ability-denial threat and lets me weaponize it.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✗ Out of range → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Phantom is critical and in range at (5,4) - priority kill. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Phantom is critical so 2dmg should finish it. No Vector adjacent to me so precision_shot is not blocked.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Snare(vector) is at (4,4), distance 2 — in range for trap but I must NOT move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. I'm at (3,3). Traps are already at (3,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5). I should place a trap at (4,2) or (5,3) to cut off Hawk approaching from (5,0). Moving to (4,2) puts me closer to Hawk's approach path without going adjacent to Snare at (4,4). From (4,2) I can place a trap at (5,3) to intercept Hawk. Wait — I can trap from current position first, then move. From (3,3), I can place trap at (4,2) which is within range 2 and empty. Then move to (5,3) to pressure Hawk's lane. But (5,3) is adjacent to Snare at (4,4)? Distance from (5,3) to (4,4) = 1+1=2, not adjacent. Safe. Actually let me trap (4,2) now, then move toward Hawk's path.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is critical at (5,4) distance 1 - pulse hits all within 1 tile. Aegis is also adjacent at (4,3). Pulse would hit both Phantom and Aegis for 1dmg each. Phantom is critical so 1dmg likely finishes them. Then I can place a trap between enemy positions to control the area.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Snare at (3,4), dist=2. Not in attack range from current position. I need to move adjacent to attack. Valid moves include (4,4) which puts me at dist=1 from Snare at (3,4) — adjacent, so I can attack. But wait, (4,4) is adjacent to Snare? (3,4) to (4,4) = 1 tile, yes adjacent. I'll lose Fortify by moving but I need to close distance. Move to (4,4), then attack Snare at (3,4).
  State: Hawk 4/4, Snare 4/7, Aegis 8/12, Snare 6/7 | Dead: Wraith, Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Snare (vector) is at (5,3), dist=3 — out of precision_shot range (max 2). I need to close to range 2 without going adjacent (which would block precision_shot due to vector denial). Moving to (5,2) puts me at dist=1 — too close (adjacent, blocked). Moving to (4,1) puts me at dist ~2.8 from (5,3) — not adjacent. Actually let me check: (5,2) is 1 tile from (5,3) = adjacent, blocked. (4,1) to (5,3): dx=1, dy=2, Chebyshev=2 — that's range 2, not adjacent. Perfect. Move to (4,1) then fire precision_shot at Snare (5,3) for 2dmg since I moved (1dmg if moved). Wait — orders say prioritize killing wounded enemies. Allied Snare is wounded, not enemy Snare. Enemy Snare is healthy. Still, I should engage. From (4,1): dist to enemy Snare at (5,3) = Chebyshev max(1,2)=2, within range 2. Not adjacent. precision_shot fires for 1dmg (moved). That's my best play.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (4,4). I'm at (3,4) with denial active, blocking some of Aegis's abilities. Pulse would hit Aegis for 1 damage since it's within 1 tile. After pulsing, I should move away from Aegis to avoid being attacked while staying out of Snare's denial range. Moving to (2,4) keeps me away from Snare (dist 3+) and out of Aegis's immediate reach. I could also place a trap to control the area between enemies. Let me pulse Aegis first for free damage, then reposition to (2,5) to place myself between chokepoints.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 Enemy Snare is at (2,4) dist=2 to my west, Hawk is at (4,1) dist=3 to my south. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy (Snare at dist=2) and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Both enemies are generally to my west/south. Moving west to (3,4) gets me closer to Snare. From (3,4), Snare at (2,4) is adjacent — but I'm a sentinel not vector, so I can attack adjacent. Wait — I need to check: if I move to (3,4), Snare is at dist=1 (adjacent), I can attack. Shield_wall facing W covers the most enemies (Snare is W of me currently). Let me move to (3,4) to close on Snare, then use shield_wall facing W since Snare is to my west. Actually if Snare is adjacent after move, I should attack instead. Moving to (3,4): Snare at (2,4) would be adjacent (dist=1). I should attack Snare instead of shield_wall when adjacent per orders.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Hawk is at (4,1) moving north, Snare is at (2,4). I need to position traps on likely enemy paths. Hawk at (4,1) heading north might move toward (4,2) or (5,1). There's already a trap at (4,2). I should move closer and place a trap on a tile Hawk might traverse. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying near Aegis at (3,4). From (4,3) I can place a trap at (4,2)... but that's already trapped. I'll place at (5,2) or (5,1) to catch Hawk moving east/northeast. Actually, let me move to (4,3) to support Aegis and place a trap at (4,2) - wait, already trapped. Place at (5,2) anticipating Hawk moving east.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Enemy Snare(vector) is at (4,3), distance 2 — in range for precision_shot (2dmg). I'm currently at (4,1) which means Snare is directly north, not adjacent (distance 2), so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved yet so I get full 2dmg. Fire precision_shot at Snare first. Then I can move to maintain positioning or wait. Aegis is out of range at dist 4. Priority: kill or wound Snare with precision_shot now.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (2,4) - attack it. I'm fortified so I should not move to keep damage reduction. Hawk is to the south at (3,1), so shield_wall facing S would help allies, but Snare's denial zone blocks abilities other than basic attack. I'll attack adjacent Snare, then wait to keep fortify.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(2,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Aegis is adjacent at (3,4), wounded. I can pulse to deal 1dmg to all within 1 tile (hits Aegis) which may finish them off. But I need to survive. If I move away first, I lose the pulse range on Aegis. Better to pulse first (hits Aegis at dist=1), then move away from danger. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile — Aegis is at dist=1 so it gets hit. After pulsing, I should retreat to safety since I'm at 1HP.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Snare is critical at (1,4) moving W - likely heading toward (0,4) or similar. Hawk is at (3,1) moving W, healthy. I'm at (4,3) with traps already at (2,3) and (4,2). Need to cut off Hawk's approach. Moving to (4,4) keeps me near Aegis at (3,4) for mutual support. Then place a trap at (3,3) - a likely chokepoint if Hawk moves north or Snare moves east.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis (sentinel, wounded) is at (3,4), distance 3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 which exceeds range 2). Recon confirms inRange:true for Aegis though — checking: precision_shot range ≤2 tiles but dist=3? The recon says inRange:true so I'll trust that. I'm at (3,1), not adjacent to enemy Vector (Snare is at (4,4), dist=4), so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire precision_shot at wounded Aegis for 2dmg to potentially kill it. I haven't moved so no penalty. Then wait or reposition.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 4/7 HP. Snare is critical at (1,4) distance 3, Hawk is healthy at (3,1) distance 4. There are already many traps placed. I should position to support Aegis at (3,4) and place a trap on a likely enemy approach path. Hawk at (3,1) moving north could come through (3,2) or approach via (4,2)/(5,2) — but (4,2) and (3,3) already have traps. I should move to (5,4) to stay out of Snare's denial range (currently dist=3, don't go adjacent) and place a trap at (5,3) or (5,2) to cover eastern approach. Actually (5,2) already has a trap. Let me place at (4,5) or (5,5) — Hawk approaching from south might use (4,3) or (5,3). I'll move to (5,4) and place trap at (5,3) to cover that corridor.
- **Snare** (vector): move(0,4) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically low. Aegis is wounded and 2 tiles away. I need to either escape or deal damage before dying. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, but Aegis is 2 tiles away so out of pulse range. I can place a trap between Aegis and my position to punish their advance. Moving toward (2,4) puts me adjacent to Aegis which is risky at 1HP. Better to retreat slightly and place a trap on the path Aegis would take. If I move to (0,4) I'm safer and can place a trap at (1,4) or (2,4) to block Aegis's path.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(1,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 6/12 HP. Both enemies are 3 tiles away. Hawk is at (3,1) to my south, Snare is at (0,4) to my west. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing most enemies. Both enemies are equidistant. Hawk is directly south at (3,1), Snare is directly west at (0,4). I should advance toward one. Moving south toward Hawk: (3,3) is a trap, so I can't safely go there. Moving west toward Snare: (2,4) is valid. But if I move I lose Fortify. Given I'm wounded at 6/12 HP, I should be cautious. Let me advance toward Snare (west) since they're critical - move to (2,4), then use shield_wall facing W to block incoming damage from that direction.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 4 and 5). Aegis is closer at dist 4 to my northwest at (2,4). I need to close to range 2 to use precision_shot. Moving to (3,3) gets me to dist 3 from Aegis - still not in range. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist 2 from Aegis at (2,4) - that's exactly range 2, which should bring Aegis into precision_shot range. I'm at full HP so no risk concerns. Ally Snare is critical at (0,4) near the trap at (1,4) - enemy Aegis is wounded and priority target.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,4) with 1HP - critically low. Aegis is wounded at (2,4), distance 2, in range. There's already a trap at (1,4) between us. I should attack Aegis with pulse to deal 1dmg to all adjacent units, or use attack. Aegis is at dist 2 so attack won't reach (adjacent only). Pulse hits within 1 tile - Aegis at dist 2 is out of pulse range too. I can use trap but (1,4) already has one. My best option: move closer to use pulse, or attack. If I move to (1,4) I'd step on my own trap - bad. Move to (1,3) then pulse? Aegis at (2,4) would be dist ~1.4 from (1,3) - not adjacent. Move to (0,3) keeps distance. Actually I need to survive - at 1HP I should stay back. But I can place a trap at (1,5) to block approach routes. Or I could move to (1,3) and pulse won't reach Aegis at (2,4). Best play: place trap at (1,5) to control the flank, staying at (0,4). Trap blocks (1,4) already exists. Place at (0,3) or (1,5) to create a chokepoint corridor.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → attack(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 5/12 HP, fortified. Hawk is at (2,2) dist=2 to the south, Snare(enemy vector) is at (0,4) dist=2 to the west. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Both enemies are roughly equidistant. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (2,2) — but (2,3) is a trap! Avoid traps. Moving to (1,4) gets me closer to enemy Snare at (0,4), dist would be 1 — adjacent, allowing attack. But I lose fortify by moving. With 5HP, I should be careful. The enemy Snare is at critical health, so attacking it would likely finish it. Moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to enemy Snare at (0,4). Then I can attack. However, I also lose fortification. Alternatively, stay put and use shield_wall. But orders say advance. Let me move to (1,4) to get adjacent to enemy Snare and attack it. Shield_wall facing W covers the enemy Snare direction and S covers Hawk direction — W has both enemies roughly, but Hawk is S. Most enemies: W has Snare, S has Hawk. I'll move to (1,4) then attack enemy Snare at (0,4).
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (2,2) heading N, dist=5. My traps already cover (5,2),(5,3),(4,2),(3,3),(2,3),(3,5) — good southern coverage. Hawk moving north could come through (2,3) which is already trapped. I should move toward ally Aegis at (1,4) for mutual support while placing a trap on a likely path. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to center and Aegis. From (4,4) I can place a trap at (3,4) which is on Hawk's likely approach path northward.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded and in range at dist=3. I'm at full HP with range 2, but dist=3 means Aegis is just outside precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). I need to close to dist≤2. Move to (1,3) puts me adjacent-ish — dist to (1,4) would be 1, which is adjacent, blocking precision_shot if Vector is near. Better: move to (2,3) — dist to Aegis at (1,4) = sqrt(1+1)=1.41, still dist=2 in tile terms. Actually (2,3) to (1,4): |2-1|+|3-4|=1+1=2, exactly range 2. No Vector adjacency issue since Snare is at (4,4). Fire precision_shot on Aegis for 2dmg to finish the wounded sentinel.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (2,3) heading N, dist 3. Many traps already placed. Aegis is critical at (1,4). I should move closer to support Aegis and place a trap on a tile Hawk might pass through heading north. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to existing trap coverage. Better: move to (3,5) to block northern approach, but (3,5) already has a trap. Move to (4,5) keeps distance and lets me place a trap on (3,5)... already trapped. Hawk heading N from (2,3) might go to (2,4) or (2,5). I can't reach those. Move to (3,4) - already trapped. Move to (2,4) gets me adjacent to Hawk's likely path. From (2,4) I could pulse if Hawk moves adjacent. Let me move to (3,4) - wait that's trapped, can't land there. Valid moves show (3,4) is valid despite trap (traps are invisible mines). Move to (3,4) and place trap on (2,4) which is in Hawk's likely northward path.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with 3/12 HP, fortified. Hawk is at (2,3), distance 2 — not adjacent, can't attack yet. My ally Snare is at (3,4) which is also where a trap is. I need to advance toward Hawk. Moving to (2,4) closes distance to Hawk at (2,3) — that would make Hawk adjacent (1 tile north). Then I can attack. But (2,4) has a trap! Check valid moves: (2,4) is listed as valid. Traps at (2,4) — stepping there triggers it. At 3HP that's risky. Alternative: move to (1,3) to get closer without trap, then Hawk at (2,3) is diagonal (dist=1.4, not adjacent for melee). Or move to (2,5) — no trap, but Hawk still at dist 2. Best option: move to (2,4) despite trap risk — it puts Hawk adjacent for an attack. Actually wait, I lose fortify if I move. With 3HP losing fortify is very dangerous. Let me reconsider: stay put, keep fortify, use shield_wall facing E (where Hawk is at (2,3), which is SE — enemy is to my E/SE). Snare is at (3,4) to my E. Shield wall facing E protects Snare from Hawk. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy, but at 3HP with fortify active, I need to be careful. Orders take priority: advance. Move to (2,4) is closest to Hawk without going diagonal. Trap risk but orders say advance. After moving, attack Hawk at (2,3) which is adjacent.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Snare(vector) is at dist=2, which means precision_shot is blocked if I'm adjacent to Snare — but Snare is at (3,4) and I'm at (2,3), not adjacent, so precision_shot is available from current position. However, Aegis(sentinel) is at dist=1 (adjacent at (2,4)) which is critical HP. Priority: kill Aegis first with attack (adjacent, 1dmg — but Aegis is 'critical' so likely 1HP left), then use precision_shot on Snare(wounded). Attack Aegis adjacent, then precision_shot Snare at (3,4) dist=2 without moving (full 2dmg).
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP, critically low. Hawk is wounded at (2,3) distance 2, within my attack range. Aegis ally is at (2,4) also critical. I'm already standing on a trap at (3,4) and there's a trap at (2,4) where Aegis is. Hawk is at (2,3) which also has a trap - good. I should attack Hawk who is wounded and within range. Then move to a safer position. Actually, I should move first to avoid being in a bad spot, then attack. Let me attack Hawk first (wounded, within range 2), then move away. Attack range is 'adjacent only' per my ability list - wait, attack is range:adjacent only (dist=1). Hawk is at dist=2, not adjacent. So I can't attack. Trap range is ≤2 tiles. Pulse is 1 tile AoE. Hawk at dist=2 is out of pulse range. I can place a trap, but I'm at (3,4) which already has a trap, and Hawk is at (2,3) which also has a trap. No useful trap placement. Best action: move toward Hawk to get adjacent for attack, then attack. Move to (2,3)? That's where Hawk is - can't move there. Move to (3,3) - has a trap, risky. Move to (4,3) gets me closer. Actually move to (2,4)? That's where Aegis is. Let me move to (4,4) to reposition safely, then wait or place trap. Or move to (3,3) to be adjacent to Hawk at (2,3) - but (3,3) has a trap. I'll move to (4,4) to stay safe and place a trap at a chokepoint like (3,3) which Hawk might move through - but it already has a trap. Place trap at (4,3) as a defensive position. Actually with 2HP I should stay back. Move to (4,4), then place trap at (4,3) to deny that corridor.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent at (2,3) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. At 2HP I'm critical but Hawk is wounded too. Attack Hawk now while fortified — don't move to preserve fortify bonus.
