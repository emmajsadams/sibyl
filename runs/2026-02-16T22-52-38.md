## Squads
### Player
- **Nullfield** (vector): "Move toward enemy medic and oracle to deny their abilities. Place denial_mine on chokepoints. Use EMP when adjacent to multiple enemies. Your presence blocks abilities — get close to high-value targets."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Use precision_shot on wounded enemies. Use suppressing_fire to slow rushers. Stay behind Nullfield for protection."
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and flank. Target the enemy medic with shadow_strike. Use breach on the oracle if the medic is dead. Avoid the enemy frontline."
### Opponent
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Keep Prophet alive with patch. Use overclock on Bulwark when no healing needed. Stay behind Bulwark. AVOID the enemy Vector — do not get adjacent or your abilities will be blocked."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use foresight early to reveal the enemy specter. Use mind_spike to break cloak. Stay at range. AVOID the enemy Vector — if adjacent, your abilities are denied."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance and shield_wall to protect your backline. Engage the enemy vector to keep it away from your medic and oracle. Use overwatch to punish movement."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: cloak immediately as instructed. Move forward to begin flanking toward enemy medic Lifeline at (1,5).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies out of range. Move to (3,2) to get closer while staying behind Nullfield. This positions for precision_shot next turn.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is in scan range (dist=4). Scanning to reveal enemy prompts early. Stay mobile to avoid Vector approach.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1: All allies at full HP. Move closer to support range while staying behind Bulwark. Position (2,5) keeps me behind the frontline and adjacent to Bulwark for future overclock opportunities.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Move toward Bulwark to establish denial zone. Place trap at (2,3) as a chokepoint - it's directly between me and the medic/oracle cluster, forcing them to path around or take damage.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Nullfield's denial zone is blocking my abilities. I need to attack it immediately to disable the zone and protect my backline. After attacking, I'll position to shield_wall and protect Lifeline and Prophet from the enemy Longshot.
  State: Nullfield 5/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 5/5, Bulwark 10/10, Lifeline 6/6, Prophet 8/8

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,5) ✓
  💭 Cloaked, 2 turns left. Orders: flank medic with shadow_strike. Lifeline@(2,5) is 4 tiles away. Behind tile (1,5) is reachable in 1 move and adjacent. Move to (1,5) behind Lifeline, then shadow_strike to deal 2dmg while keeping cloak.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is in range at (3,4). Use precision_shot for 2dmg without moving to maximize damage. Stay at current position to maintain formation with Nullfield.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → patch(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded (9/10 HP) and not adjacent. Need to move closer to heal. Move to (3,5) to get adjacent to Bulwark at (3,4), then patch. Avoid (2,4) - too close to Nullfield.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → mind_spike(0,3) ✗ Unknown ability: mind_spike
  💭 Shade cloaked at (0,3). Move to (5,4) to get within scan range (dist=4). Use mind_spike to break cloak and reveal specter.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Nullfield is 2 tiles away at (2,3). Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to engage it and keep it away from backline. Then shield_wall East to protect Prophet at (5,4) from eastern threats.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → pulse(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,4). I should move toward Lifeline/Prophet to deny their abilities. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer to both high-value targets while maintaining pressure. Then use pulse to damage Bulwark and potentially hit others if they move closer.
  State: Nullfield 5/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 5/5, Bulwark 9/10, Lifeline 3/6, Prophet 8/8

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 Lifeline (medic) is wounded and I can reach behind her at (2,5) in 1 move. She's facing E, so (2,5) is behind her. Move there and use shadow_strike to finish her while maintaining cloak.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is cloaked and at max scan range (4 tiles). Must scan now before it gets closer or I lose vision. Nullfield is only 2 tiles away - need to maintain distance to avoid ability denial.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lifeline is critical (low HP) and in range at distance 3. Use precision_shot to eliminate the medic before they can heal allies. No movement needed - already have clear line of sight.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 Shade (specter) adjacent at (2,5) is the immediate threat. Nullfield's denial zone is blocking abilities. Must move away from denial zone first, then engage. Move to (1,4) to escape denial and position for shield_wall protecting Prophet from northern threats.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet at (5,4) is priority target - oracle abilities are high value to deny. Move to (4,4) to get adjacent and activate Denial passive, then place trap at (5,3) to control Prophet's retreat path
  State: Nullfield 5/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 5/5, Bulwark 9/10, Prophet 8/8 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → breach(5,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet (oracle/medic) at (5,4) is priority target. Can reach behind position (5,5) in 1 move, then breach to hijack their turn. Bulwark is closer but sentinel is lower priority than disabling enemy healer.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies at range 4 (max range 3). Move to (4,3) to get Prophet in range 3, use precision_shot for 2dmg.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Nullfield is adjacent, blocking my abilities. Must move away first. Orders say move to (4,3) then smite Bulwark, but (4,3) is occupied by Longshot. Valid moves: (3,4),(4,5),(5,2),(5,3). Moving to (4,5) clears denial zone and keeps scan range on all enemies. Then attack Nullfield (adjacent after move) since smite is blocked by denial.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → pulse(3,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (4,5) - already in denial range. Move to (3,4) to get closer to Bulwark while maintaining denial on Prophet, then pulse to damage both Prophet (dist 1) and potentially Longshot if positioning allows denial coverage of multiple targets.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Nullfield is 2 tiles away at (3,4). Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to engage and protect Prophet. Then shield_wall E to block Nullfield's denial field from reaching Prophet at (4,5).
  State: Nullfield 4/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 5/5, Bulwark 9/10, Prophet 7/8 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(4,5) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Prophet (oracle/medic) is adjacent at (4,5). I can move to (4,4) which is BEHIND Prophet (they face N), then use breach to turn them against their team. This is more valuable than shadow_strike since breach gives us control of their healer.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet at (4,5) is in range and I have clear LoS. Use precision_shot for 2dmg without moving first to maximize damage.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move to (4,3) and smite Bulwark at (1,4), but Bulwark is my ally at (2,4). This is clearly an error. Following the actual tactical situation: Shade is adjacent and cloaked, Longshot at (4,3) already shot at me. I should scan Nullfield (the vector) since they're in range and not yet scanned, then reposition away from the cluster.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Nullfield is adjacent, blocking abilities. Attack it to damage and force repositioning. Then shield_wall east to protect Prophet from Longshot/Shade.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → pulse(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent, denying its shield_wall. Prophet at (5,5) is high-value target. Move to (4,5) to get closer to Prophet while maintaining denial on Bulwark. Then pulse to damage both Bulwark(adj after move) and any units within range.
  State: Nullfield 3/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 4/5, Bulwark 9/10, Prophet 4/8 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet (oracle/medic) is wounded and behind me at (5,5). I can move adjacent to (5,4) and use shadow_strike (keeps cloak) to finish the medic. Bulwark is at (2,4) facing east - I could breach from (1,4) but Prophet is the priority target per orders.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is critical (1hp) at range 3 - easy kill with precision_shot. Moving first would reduce damage to 1, leaving Prophet alive. Stay put and finish Prophet.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Move forward to (3,4) to close distance while maintaining fortify for next turn. Then shield_wall east to protect against Shade's likely advance.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is 2 tiles away at (3,4). Move adjacent to deny abilities and attack. Moving to (3,5) puts me next to Bulwark, blocking their abilities with Denial passive.
  State: Nullfield 3/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 4/5, Bulwark 8/10 | Dead: Lifeline, Prophet

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at (3,4) facing E. I can move to (2,4) which is behind them and adjacent. Then breach to take control.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at range 2, within precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet, so precision_shot will deal full 2dmg. No adjacent enemies, so I can shoot freely.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → pulse(2,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent. Move to (2,5) to stay in denial range while repositioning toward backline. Then pulse to damage Bulwark and any allies in range.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✗ Position occupied → attack(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Orders: move to (4,3) and attack Longshot. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Longshot for melee attack. Will lose Fortify but executing direct orders.
  State: Nullfield 3/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 3/5, Bulwark 7/10 | Dead: Lifeline, Prophet

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Medic is dead. Breach exhausted (2/2). I'm already behind Bulwark (facing E, I'm at W). He's adjacent and healthy. Shadow_strike keeps cloak - use it to damage without breaking stealth, then reposition.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range at dist 2. I can finish them with precision_shot without moving, dealing 2dmg from stationary position.
- **Nullfield** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → pulse(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is 2 tiles away and wounded. Move adjacent to deny abilities and finish with pulse AoE damage.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✗ Position occupied → attack(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Orders are to move to (4,3) and attack Longshot. Currently adjacent to Nullfield's denial zone which blocks abilities, but movement still works. Move to (4,3) first to close distance and get adjacent to Longshot, then use basic attack (1dmg, melee range only).
  State: Nullfield 3/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 3/5, Bulwark 4/10 | Dead: Lifeline, Prophet

### Turn 9 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range if I move to (2,4) which is behind them. Shadow_strike deals 2dmg and keeps cloak, but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack breaks cloak anyway. Move behind Bulwark to (2,4) then attack for the kill.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range at (3,4). I'm at full HP with clear LoS. Use precision_shot for 2dmg since I haven't moved yet to finish the enemy.
- **Nullfield** (vector): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical (low HP) and adjacent. Finish him with attack, then move to deny enemy backline abilities.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✗ Position occupied → attack(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Orders: move to (4,3) and attack Longshot. Moving to (4,3) places me on Longshot's position. Then attack Longshot.
  State: Nullfield 3/6, Longshot 4/4, Shade 3/5, Bulwark 1/10 | Dead: Lifeline, Prophet
