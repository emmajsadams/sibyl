Deadeye failed last turn at range 6 to (3,5), so staying far is key. Rampart is at (2,5) healthy with shield_wall facing N. Grid is wounded at (5,5). I should recalibrate Grid to help them, but Grid is at (5,5) and I can only reach (3,5) max — not adjacent. Best play: move to maximize distance from Deadeye (currently at 4,3) and avoid being in Deadeye's sight. Moving to (0,2) or (0,3) keeps me far. Actually I should recalibrate Grid but can't reach adjacency. My priority is survival at 1HP. Move away from threats — go to (0,2) to maximize distance from Deadeye at (4,3) which would be dist ~5. Then wait. Deadeye is at (4,3), moving to (0,3) gives dist=sqrt(16+0)=4, (0,2) gives dist=sqrt(16+1)~4.1. Let me move to (1,3) — dist to Deadeye = sqrt(9+0)=3, too close. (0,3) dist to Deadeye = 4 tiles exactly, in scan range. Best: move to (0,2) — dist to Deadeye = sqrt(16+1)≈4.1, just outside range. Then wait to survive.",

I need to move closer to Grid to get within range 2. Moving to (5,4) would put me adjacent to Grid at (5,5) - that's dist=1, fine for precision_shot but Grid is a vector so being adjacent blocks precision_shot. Moving to (4,5) puts me at dist=1 from Grid - also adjacent, blocks precision_shot. Moving to (5,3) puts me at dist=2 from Grid (5,5) - that's within range and NOT adjacent, so precision_shot works.
