(4,3) would put me dist=2 from Doc at (3,4), enabling precision_shot. Let me check: from (4,3) to (3,4) = |4-3|+|3-4| = 1+1 = 2, in range. But moving then using precision_shot deals 1dmg (moved penalty). Alternatively, I'm currently adjacent-ish to Bulwark at dist=2, not adjacent (adjacent = 1 tile). I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot isn't blocked. I can move to (4,3) to get within range 2 of Doc, then precision_shot Doc for 1dmg (moved penalty). Or stay and shoot Bulwark for 2dmg with precision_shot. Orders say medics first. Moving to (4,3) puts me dist=1 from Bulwark though — that would make me adjacent, blocking precision_shot! Avoid that. Move to (5,3) instead: dist to Doc (3,4) = 2+1=3, still out of range. Move to (4,4): dist to Doc (3,4) = 1+0=1, in range, not adjacent to Bulwark (dist to Bulwark from (4,4) = 1+1=2). Precision_shot from (4,4) hits Doc for 1dmg (moved). That's the best play.",

But I'm adjacent to Bulwark, so I need to check if precision_shot is blocked — the warning says blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not sentinel. So I can use precision_shot.
