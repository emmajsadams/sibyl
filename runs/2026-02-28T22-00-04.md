## Squads
### Player
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — activate cloak immediately per orders and tip. All enemies are 6+ tiles away, nothing in range. Move south toward center to close distance while cloaked.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Then advance toward Lifeline (the enemy damage dealer / support to assassinate). Move north toward (2,4) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on the damage dealer if all healthy. Wraith is the specter/damage dealer. Wraith is at (0,2), distance 5 - not adjacent. I need to move toward Wraith to get adjacent. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer but still not adjacent to Wraith at (0,2) - distance would be 2. Moving to (1,4) puts me at distance 3 from Wraith. Best I can do is move to (1,3) to be distance 2 from Wraith, but that's not adjacent. Actually let me check: from (1,3), Wraith is at (0,2) - Manhattan distance = 1+1 = 2, not adjacent. I can move speed 3. To be adjacent to Wraith at (0,2), I need to be at (0,1), (1,2), (0,3), or (-1,2). From valid moves, (1,3) is available and gets me closest. Actually (2,2) is in valid moves - from there to (0,2) is distance 2. Hmm, none of my valid moves get me adjacent to Wraith this turn. I'll move toward Wraith as much as possible - go to (1,3) which is distance 2 from Wraith. Then wait since I can't overclock from non-adjacent.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is in range at dist 3 from current position (1,0). precision_shot has range ≤2 tiles, so Lifeline at dist 3 is out of range for that. I need to move closer. Moving to (1,1) puts me at dist 2 from Lifeline at (1,3) — within precision_shot range. But if I move first, precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Alternatively, I can use precision_shot first if already in range — but dist 3 exceeds range 2. So I must move first, accepting 1dmg shot. Move to (1,2) gives dist 1 from Lifeline — but that's adjacent which blocks precision_shot if a Vector is adjacent (no Vector here, so fine). Actually precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2. Moving to (1,1) gives dist 2, still valid. Moving to (1,2) gives dist 1, also valid. I'll move to (1,1) to stay safer and shoot Lifeline for 1dmg.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are 5-6 tiles away. I need to advance toward the front line to position between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to the center while staying between Bolt at (1,1) and the enemies at (1,3) and (2,5). No enemies in range to attack yet.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 Enemies are out of range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move toward the enemy cluster (Aegis at 3,2, Bolt at 1,1). Best advance is toward center — move to (2,3) gets me 2 tiles closer while staying central. Then shield_wall facing South toward enemies to protect allies behind me.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Aegis 8/8, Veil 4/4, Bastion 8/8, Lifeline 11/12, Wraith 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): breach(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Bastion (sentinel) at (2,4) facing S, cloaked with 1 turn remaining. I can use breach right now from current position since I'm behind Bastion. This will control the sentinel next turn. After breach, cloak breaks but that's acceptable — I've used it for positioning. Breach the sentinel to disrupt their defensive posture, then I can follow up. No need to move first.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Bolt is the priority target (striker = damage dealer). I can reach (1,0) which is directly behind Bolt (facing N, so south side). Moving to (1,0) puts me adjacent and behind for a breach next turn. But wait - cloak has 1 turn remaining, meaning it drops at end of this turn or after my action. I should use this turn to get into position behind Bolt at (1,0), which is reachable (dist=1 from current... actually dist from (0,2) to (1,0) = Manhattan 1+2=3, within mv3). Then next turn I can breach Bolt from behind.
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP so no healing needed. Bastion is adjacent at (2,3) and is our damage dealer (sentinel). I should use overclock on Bastion to boost their effectiveness. I'm at (1,3), Bastion is at (2,3) which is adjacent. Veil is at (2,4) threatening Bastion's area. I'll use overclock on Bastion first, then consider positioning.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (1,0) — precision_shot is blocked if adjacent to enemy Vector, but Wraith is a specter not a Vector, so precision_shot should work. However Wraith is at dist=1 (adjacent), which means precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2, so it's valid. But wait — the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically, not all enemies. Wraith is a specter, so precision_shot is fine. Lifeline is at (1,3) dist=2, also in range. Priority: Lifeline is the medic (support), high value target. Wraith at dist=1 is a threat. If I fire precision_shot at Lifeline (dist=2, haven't moved), I deal 2dmg. Then I could move away from Wraith. Or move first to get distance from Wraith then shoot Lifeline. If I move first, precision_shot does only 1dmg. Better to shoot Lifeline first (2dmg, no move penalty), then move away from Wraith toward (0,2) or (2,1) to create distance.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction. Bastion is at (2,3), distance 2 — not adjacent so I can't attack. Moving to (2,2) would put me adjacent to Bastion at (2,3) and closer to the threat line. From (2,2) I could then use shield_wall facing N to protect allies from Bastion. Better: move to (3,3) to close on Bastion and be adjacent to use shield_wall W toward Bastion's direction. Actually (2,2) is best — adjacent to Bastion at (2,3) allows attack. Move to (2,2), then attack Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. Current position (2,3), allies at (1,3) and (1,0). Valid moves include (4,3) which moves east away from allies at (1,3) and toward the edge. I have 2 ability uses but orders say to move away from combat, so I'll move to (4,3) and wait.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Aegis 8/8, Veil 4/4, Bastion 6/8, Lifeline 9/12, Wraith 4/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at 6/8 HP and is 3 tiles away at (4,3). I need to move toward Bastion to get adjacent and heal. My move range is 3. Moving to (3,3) gets me dist=1 from Bastion at (4,3), making us adjacent. Then I can use patch to heal Bastion for 2HP. Veil is at (2,4) and Aegis at (2,2) - both enemies are 2 away from my current position but moving to (3,3) keeps me away from them (Aegis at dist=2, Veil at dist=2 from new position). No enemy Vector present so patch is not blocked.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✓
  💭 Bolt is the priority target (damage dealer). I'm at (1,0) facing S. Bolt is at (2,1) facing E — I'm behind them. Moving to (1,1) puts me adjacent and behind Bolt, enabling breach. I'll move to (1,1) then breach Bolt to take control of them next turn, disrupting enemy offense.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is the enemy medic/damage dealer and I'm already behind them (facing E, I'm to their west). I can move to (2,3) which puts me adjacent and behind Lifeline, then use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. This is ideal — I'm already cloaked from turn 1, shadow_strike won't break cloak, and I'm attacking the priority target from behind.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge. Allies are at (2,2) and (2,3). I'm at (2,1). Moving to (4,1) puts me far from allies and toward the east edge. Wraith is adjacent but orders prioritize movement. No second action needed after a full move.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Wraith is at (1,1) dist=2, Lifeline at (3,3) dist=2. I should move toward the enemies to engage while protecting my allies. Moving to (3,2) closes distance to both Lifeline and Bastion, positions me between allies and enemies. From there I can use shield_wall toward enemies to protect Veil at (2,3) or Bolt at (4,1).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. I'm at (4,3) facing E. Valid moves include (5,3) and (5,4) which push me toward the east edge. Moving to (5,3) gets me to the edge and away from the cluster of enemies near (2-4, 1-3). Then wait.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Aegis 8/8, Veil 4/4, Bastion 8/8, Lifeline 8/12, Wraith 4/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,1) ✓
  💭 Priority target is Bolt (striker = damage dealer). I can reach (3,1) which is directly behind Bolt. From there I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Move to (3,1), then shadow_strike Bolt at (4,1).
- **Veil** (specter): breach(3,3) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Lifeline (at 2,3, they face E so I'm to their west/behind). I can breach Lifeline right now to take control of the enemy medic — this is extremely high value. After breach, I'll have used 2/2 breaches. Alternatively, shadow_strike keeps me stealthy but breach on the medic is devastating. Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer — Wraith is the damage dealer but is out of range. However, Lifeline is adjacent and I'm already behind them. Breaching Lifeline turns their healer against them. I'm not cloaked (no cloak indicator), so shadow_strike won't preserve cloak. I'll breach Lifeline first (no move needed, already behind), then move toward Wraith at (2,1) to position for next turn.
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally Bolt at (4,1) and attack Wraith if possible. But Wraith is an ally (specter,A) — I should not attack allies. Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (3,2). I'll move toward (4,2) to get closer to Bolt, then attack Aegis who is adjacent to my current position before moving — actually I should attack first then move. Aegis is at (3,2), dist=1, so I can attack now. Then move toward Bolt at (4,1): from (3,3) moving to (4,2) gets me dist=1 from Bolt.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. Allies are at (3,2) and (2,1). Moving to (5,1) gets me closer to the east edge and away from both allies. From (5,1) I can still fire at Lifeline at (4,2) with precision_shot since I won't be adjacent to a Vector enemy.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction. Lifeline (medic, wounded) is adjacent at (4,2) — high value target. Wraith (specter) is also adjacent at (3,1). Attacking Lifeline first removes their healing support. I should stay put to keep Fortify active, then attack Lifeline. No move needed.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (5,3) facing E. Valid moves include (5,4) and (5,5) which move me north along the eastern edge, away from enemies clustered at (5,1), (3,2), (2,1). Moving to (5,5) puts me at the far corner, maximizing distance from combat.
  State: Bolt 4/5, Aegis 7/8, Veil 4/4, Bastion 8/8, Lifeline 6/12, Wraith 4/4

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(3,1) ✓ → move(3,0) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,1) facing E, and I'm at (2,1) which is directly behind them. I have shadow_strike available which deals 1dmg, works at adjacent range, and keeps cloak. This is a perfect opportunity — strike from behind while staying cloaked. Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). After shadow_strike I can move toward Lifeline to pressure the wounded medic next turn.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → breach(5,1) ✓
  💭 Priority: assassinate Bolt (enemy striker/damage dealer). I'm already behind Veil at current position (3,1) — Veil is at (3,0) facing S, so I'm directly behind. But orders say assassinate the damage dealer Bolt. Bolt is at (5,1) facing E, and (4,1) is behind Bolt and reachable. I can move to (4,1) then breach Bolt from behind. This eliminates the primary threat and uses breach effectively on the damage dealer rather than wasting it on a sentinel.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,1) ✗ Position occupied → patch(4,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally Bolt at (4,1) and attack Wraith if possible. Wait - Bolt is an enemy striker, Wraith is my wounded ally at (4,1). I should move to (4,1) to be adjacent to Wraith and heal them (HP 3/4, wounded). That also serves the 'move toward (4,1)' order. From (4,1) I can patch Wraith. Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) currently - moving to (4,1) puts me dist=2 from Aegis, so patch won't be blocked. Wraith needs healing more than attacking.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. Valid moves show (5,3) moves me north along the east edge, further from allies at (3,2) and (3,0), and away from the main combat. I'll move to (5,3) first, then (5,3) is already my max move. Wait as second action.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (5,3), distance 2 from my position (5,5). I need to close to adjacent range to attack. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Bolt at (5,3). Then I can attack. Orders say push forward aggressively and attack when possible.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lifeline is adjacent at (4,2) and wounded — attack to finish them off. Staying put preserves Fortify (50% damage reduction). No need to move.
  State: Bolt 3/5, Aegis 7/8, Veil 4/4, Bastion 8/8, Lifeline 5/12, Wraith 4/4

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is unavailable. Priority target is Bolt (wounded damage dealer). I can reach (5,2) which is behind Bolt and adjacent — perfect for shadow_strike which keeps cloak. Move to (5,2), then shadow_strike Bolt from behind.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Lifeline (medic, wounded) is the priority target at dist 3. I can't reach adjacent to Lifeline this turn from (3,0) since it's at (4,2) — that's 3 tiles away (Manhattan). Valid moves include (4,1) which puts me 1 tile from Lifeline at (4,2). Move to (4,1), then shadow_strike Lifeline to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. This closes in on the wounded medic.
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally Bolt at (4,1) and attack Wraith if possible. Wait — Bolt is listed as an enemy striker at (5,3), and Wraith is an ally specter. The orders seem confused (attack own ally?). I'll follow the movement order to (4,1) since that's where Veil the enemy specter is, and attack Veil who is adjacent at (4,1). I'm at 4HP/12HP and critically wounded. Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) — dangerous. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer to (4,1) area. Actually Veil is already at (4,1) which is in my valid moves. I can move to (4,1) but that would occupy enemy's space — not valid. Let me move to (3,1) to reposition, then attack Veil at (4,1) which would be adjacent. Or stay and attack Veil now since Veil is at dist=1 (adjacent). I'll attack Veil now, then move away from Aegis toward (4,3) to escape pressure.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. Valid moves are [3,3],[4,2],[4,4],[5,1],[5,5]. I'm at (5,3) surrounded by enemies. Moving to (5,5) puts me at the north edge of the map, away from the cluster of allies at (3,2) and (4,1), and is the furthest from combat.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is 2 tiles away at (4,3) and Wraith is at (5,2). Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Lifeline for an attack and closer to Wraith. I'll move to (4,2) to engage Lifeline directly, then attack.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(5,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent and wounded — attack to finish. Stay put to keep Fortify active and maintain 50% damage reduction. Lifeline is critical nearby; use shield_wall facing north to protect against the enemy cluster (Aegis/Veil) approaching from the south side of the board.
  State: Bolt 1/5, Aegis 7/8, Veil 3/4, Bastion 8/8, Lifeline 3/12, Wraith 4/4

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Aegis is adjacent and healthy — shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. But orders say prioritize the enemy damage dealer (Bolt, striker, critical). I can't reach Bolt this turn (dist=3, mv=3 but Aegis blocks column). Veil (enemy specter) is at (4,1), reachable behind from (4,0). Priority: Bolt is critical and highest threat but unreachable. Veil is healthy but reachable behind. Aegis is adjacent and healthy but sentinel — low priority per orders. Best play: shadow_strike Aegis (adjacent, keeps cloak, deals 1dmg) then move toward Bolt. Or move to (4,0) behind Veil and shadow_strike Veil. Moving to (4,0) puts me behind Veil and adjacent — I can shadow_strike Veil for 1dmg while staying cloaked. That advances toward Bolt's flank next turn. Let me do: move to (4,0), then shadow_strike Veil at (4,1).
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,0) ✓ → move(4,2) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,0) facing S — I'm already behind them at (4,1). I have 2HP so I need to be decisive. Shadow_strike keeps cloak (I'm cloaked), deals 1dmg. Lifeline is critical at (4,3) — priority target per orders. After shadow_striking Wraith, I should move toward Lifeline to finish them next turn. Shadow_strike Wraith first (behind, adjacent, keeps cloak), then move toward Lifeline at (4,3) — closest reachable tile toward them is (4,2) which is also behind Lifeline.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 3/12 HP and 1 heal left. Aegis enemy is adjacent at (4,2) — patch/overclock are blocked if adjacent to enemy Vector, but Aegis is a sentinel not Vector, so abilities should work. Wraith is wounded at (3/4 HP) but dist=3, not adjacent. I need to move toward Wraith to heal them, but I'm also low HP myself. Aegis is adjacent and threatening me. Moving to (3,3) gets me dist=1 from Wraith's position area. Actually Wraith is at (4,0) — from (3,1) dist would be 2. Let me check valid moves: (3,1) is valid and puts me dist=2 from Wraith at (4,0). But I only have 1 patch use and Wraith has 3/4 HP (only 1 below max). Priority: get away from Aegis and toward Wraith. Move to (3,2) puts me away from Aegis. Then I can't reach Wraith this turn for a heal. Actually, my orders say stay adjacent to most threatened ally and use patch on most wounded. Wraith is most wounded but not adjacent. I should move closer. Move to (3,2) — dist to Wraith becomes 2. Still not adjacent. No heal possible this turn unless I move to dist=1. From (4,4) dist to Wraith=4. None of valid tiles get me adjacent to Wraith at (4,0). Closest I can get is (3,1) which is dist=2 from (4,0). Can't heal this turn. Moving away from Aegis is priority for survival. Move to (3,3) and wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. I'm at (5,5) which is already at the top-right corner. Valid moves are [3,5],[4,4],[4,5],[5,3]. Moving to (4,5) keeps me on the top edge and moves away from Bastion at (5,4). Then (3,5) moves further away from combat.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is critical and only 2 tiles away at (3,3). Veil is wounded at (4,1). Wraith is healthy at (4,0) threatening Veil. I should move toward Lifeline to get adjacent and attack, removing this critical threat. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Lifeline at (3,3) and I can attack. This also positions me between enemies and allies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) W ✓
  💭 Lifeline is critical at (3,3) and needs protection. Bolt is critical at (3,5) to the northwest. I should push forward toward the enemy cluster. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer while keeping Lifeline nearby. From there I can shield_wall facing West/North to protect Lifeline from Bolt and the enemy cluster.
  State: Bolt 1/5, Aegis 7/8, Veil 2/4, Bastion 8/8, Lifeline 2/12, Wraith 3/4

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Veil (enemy specter, wounded) is adjacent at (4,1) and I'm already behind them (I'm at (4,0), they face N). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage — if they're wounded this could finish them. Then I can move to (4,2) which puts me behind Aegis for a future attack.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Wraith is adjacent at (4,2) facing N, meaning I'm directly behind them. I can shadow_strike Wraith (keeps cloak if I have it, 1dmg) but I'm not cloaked. A regular attack would finish Wraith if they're at low HP, but they're 'healthy'. Orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer — Lifeline is critical and reachable at (4,3) behind them. But Wraith is right here and I need to deal with the immediate threat first. At 1HP I cannot afford to take a hit. Shadow_strike doesn't exist as a way to stay safe since I'm not cloaked. Best play: shadow_strike Wraith (adjacent, 1dmg) then move to (4,3) to be behind Lifeline for next turn setup — but wait, shadow_strike requires cloak to keep cloak, and I'm not cloaked. It still deals 1dmg. Actually the priority: Lifeline is critical (near death), if I move to (4,3) I'm adjacent and behind Lifeline. I can attack Lifeline to potentially finish them. Move to (4,3) first, then attack Lifeline at (3,3). That removes the healer.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → patch(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/12) with enemies adjacent (Aegis at dist=1, Veil at dist=1). Wraith is wounded at HP 3/4 but is not adjacent (dist=2). I need to survive — at 1HP I'll die next hit. I must move away from enemies to survive, and try to get adjacent to Wraith to heal. Moving to (4,1) gets me distance from enemies and closer to Wraith at (4,2) — that would make Wraith adjacent for a heal. Let me check: Wraith is at (4,2), if I move to (4,1) that's dist=1, adjacent! I can then patch Wraith. But wait — patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... the rule says blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector (a class), not just any enemy. Veil is a specter, Aegis is a sentinel. So patch should work if I'm not adjacent to a Vector-class enemy. Moving to (4,1) puts me away from Aegis(3,2) and Veil(4,3). From (4,1): dist to Aegis=(1+1)=2, dist to Veil=(0+2)=2. Not adjacent to enemies! And Wraith at (4,2) is adjacent. I can heal Wraith.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical danger. Bastion is adjacent-ish at dist=2, which is within precision_shot range. I should fire at Bastion first, then reposition away from threats. Bastion is healthy so one shot won't kill but deals 2dmg. More importantly, I need to survive - retreat away from the cluster of enemies at (4,4), (4,2), (4,3). Moving to (1,5) or (2,5) puts distance between me and threats.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,2) — attack it. Both allies are critical so I want to stay fortified if possible, but attacking Wraith is the priority. I can attack without moving to keep Fortify active. Veil is at (4,3) critical and Wraith is healthy at (4,2), so attacking Wraith protects Veil. Stay in place, attack Wraith, then wait to maintain fortification.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is critical and adjacent at (4,3). Attack to eliminate. Staying put preserves Fortify for 50% damage reduction.
  State: Bolt 1/5, Aegis 7/8, Bastion 7/8, Lifeline 1/12, Wraith 3/4 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 9 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Breach is unavailable. I'm already behind Aegis at (4,2) facing W. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage - use it on Aegis since I'm adjacent and behind. That's the best play to chip down a healthy enemy while staying cloaked. After shadow_strike I remain cloaked.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → overclock(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with 0 heals remaining - extremely vulnerable. Wraith is adjacent at (4,2) and wounded at 3/4HP. I can't heal anyone (patch unavailable). Aegis is at dist=2, threatening me. I should move away from Aegis to avoid death while staying near Wraith to support with overclock. Moving to (4,3) keeps me adjacent to Wraith and puts distance from Aegis. Then I can overclock Wraith to boost their damage output.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 1HP I need to be careful. All enemies are out of range. I should advance toward enemies to get them in range. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer while staying at distance. Then wait to preserve position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,2) and wounded — attack to finish or weaken. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is strong. Bolt is critical at (3,5) and needs protection. Attack Wraith first (in range), then use shield_wall East to block incoming threat from Bastion/Lifeline direction.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Both allies are critical and need protection. Bolt is at (3,5) distance 2, threatening from the north. I need to move closer to engage Bolt and shield my allies. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Bolt at (3,5) for an attack, and also closer to Lifeline at (4,3). After moving to (3,4), I can attack Bolt who is at dist=1 from there.

- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(4,2) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/12 HP — critically wounded. Patch is exhausted (0/3). Wraith is also at 1/4 HP adjacent to me at (4,2). I can't heal anyone. My priority is survival and support. I can use overclock on Wraith to give them 2 abilities next turn — that's high value since Wraith is still alive and acting. Aegis is at (3,2), dist=2 from me. Moving away to safety while positioning to use overclock on Wraith at (4,2) makes sense. I'm already adjacent to Wraith (dist=1). I'll use overclock on Wraith first, then move away from Aegis toward safety.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction. Bastion is at (3,4) dist=2, not adjacent so can't attack. No enemies in melee range. Orders say hold the front line between allies and enemies. Lifeline is critical at (5,3) to my east. Moving north toward Bastion at (3,3) puts me adjacent to Bastion next turn and maintains front line position. Then I can shield_wall north to block Bastion's attacks on allies behind me.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,3) - directly south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Aegis first, then shield_wall facing south to block incoming damage and protect Lifeline who is critical.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → overclock(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/12 HP - critically wounded and about to die. No heals remaining. Aegis is at dist=2, threatening me. I need to move away from danger and toward Bastion at (3,4). Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Bastion and away from Aegis. Then I can use overclock on Bastion if adjacent, but at (4,4) Bastion is at dist=1 - adjacent! I can overclock Bastion to boost their damage output.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) S ✓
  💭 I'm Bastion (sentinel) at (3,4) facing W, fortified with 6/8 HP and OVERCLOCKED (2 ability uses). Aegis is adjacent at (3,3) - south of me. Lifeline is critical at (4,4) and needs protection. Orders say push forward aggressively, shield_wall facing enemy cluster, attack when possible. With 2 ability uses I can: attack Aegis + shield_wall to protect Lifeline. Attack Aegis first (adjacent at dist=1), then shield_wall facing S to cover against any southern threats, or shield_wall facing E to protect Lifeline at (4,4). Lifeline is at (4,4) to my east and is critical - shield_wall toward E would protect her from eastern threats. But Aegis is south at (3,3), so shield_wall S would block damage from Aegis direction to adjacent allies. I'll attack Aegis first, then shield_wall facing S to cover Lifeline from Aegis's direction.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction active. Bastion is adjacent at (3,4) - I should attack it. If I move, I lose fortify. Better to stay, attack Bastion, and use shield_wall to protect allies. Lifeline is critical at (4,4) - I should shield_wall to the N to block Bastion from hitting through. Actually, Bastion is at (3,4) which is N of me. Attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing N to protect against further threats.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(3,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with only 1HP - critically low. No heals remaining. Bastion is at (3,4) wounded at 5/8HP and I'm already adjacent. Aegis enemy is at (3,3) dist=2 from me. I cannot patch (0 uses left). I should use overclock on Bastion since they're the damage dealer/ally present, then consider positioning. Overclock requires adjacency - Bastion is at (3,4), I'm at (4,4), that's adjacent. After overclock, I should move away from the enemy to avoid being killed at 1HP.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I have OVERCLOCKED (2 ability uses) and FORTIFIED (50% dmg reduction from not moving). Aegis is adjacent at (3,3), wounded. I should attack twice with both ability uses. Staying put keeps Fortify active. Lifeline is critical so I need to hold position and protect. Attack Aegis twice to finish them off.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Bastion is adjacent at (3,4) and wounded. I should attack Bastion to finish them off while staying in place to maintain Fortify passive. No need to move.
