## Squads
### Player
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
### Opponent
- **Viper** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-8, need ≤4). I need to advance north to bring them into range. Moving to (4,3) gets me 3 tiles closer. From there, Bolt at (4,5) would be dist=2, well within scan range. Insight at (2,4) would be dist=3. I'll move north then wait — no valid scan targets yet.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1: scan Prophet to reveal their prompt and deal damage. Prophet is closest at dist=3 and is the most dangerous enemy (oracle, spd3, acts before me). Staying at current position is safe behind frontline allies. No move needed.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (4,3), distance 2 from my position (4,5). I'm not adjacent to an enemy so precision_shot is available. Distance 2 is within range 3. I haven't moved so full 2 damage applies. Fire precision_shot at Prophet first, then wait or reposition. No need to move - I have clear LoS and good position.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. I need to advance toward the front line to position between allies and enemies. Insight at (2,4) is the closest threat at distance 4. Moving to (2,2) puts me on the same column as Insight, advancing toward the front. With no adjacent enemies, I'll wait as second action to trigger Fortify passive for 50% damage reduction.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Bulwark at (2,2) is the nearest threat at dist 4, heading north toward our backline. I should move toward center and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (1,3) puts me at medium range and lets me trap (2,2) or nearby tiles that enemies must cross. Bulwark will likely advance through center. I'll move to (1,3) then trap (2,3) — a chokepoint on Bulwark's path toward our backline.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,1) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,0) with no enemies in range. Viper is at (1,3) distance 4 - my biggest threat as another Vector. I should advance and place a trap on a chokepoint between enemies and allies. Moving to (1,1) gets me closer to the center while staying safe. Then I'll place a trap at (1,2) which sits between Viper at (1,3) and my position - if Viper advances south it will step on it. This denies the approach corridor.
  State: Viper 6/6, Bulwark 11/11, Prophet 5/10, Viper 6/6, Bolt 4/4, Insight 10/10

### Turn 2 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → scan(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 5/10 HP and Insight already scanned me last turn. Bolt has precision_shot queued on my position. I need to move first to dodge Bolt's incoming shot at (4,3). Moving to (5,3) gets me out of (4,3) while staying at range. Then I'll scan Bolt at (4,5) — dist=2, well within range 4 — to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. Bolt is the highest threat with precision_shot. My ally Viper is 3 tiles away so no adjacency block risk.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Viper tried to move into trap at (2,3) and ally Viper is at (1,3). Bulwark is at (2,2), healthy and unscanned — highest priority target since it's a sentinel with unknown prompt. I already know Prophet's prompt. Viper at (1,1) is at dist=4 but scan is blocked if adjacent to enemy Vector — ally Viper is at (1,3) not adjacent to me, enemy Viper is at (1,1) dist=4 so not adjacent to me either, so scan is not blocked. Bulwark at (2,2) is closest unscanned enemy (dist=2), scan it to reveal its prompt and deal damage. I'm at (2,4), no movement needed to stay safe. After scanning Bulwark, wait or consider position. Trap at (2,3) blocks direct path south. Stay at (2,4) and scan Bulwark.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded and at dist=3, exactly in range for precision_shot. I'm at (4,5) not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is valid. I have High Ground passive if no adjacent enemy (none here). Fire precision_shot at Prophet for 2dmg to finish them off. Then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): move(0,3) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 Viper and Bulwark are both at dist=2, clustered near (1,1) and (2,2). There's already a trap at (2,3). I should pulse to hit both nearby enemies since they're within 1 tile of each other — wait, pulse hits within 1 tile of ME, not a target. From (1,3), Viper at (1,1) is dist=2 and Bulwark at (2,2) is dist=2, so neither is within 1 tile of me. Pulse won't hit them from here. I should place a trap on a likely approach path. Enemies are moving north toward our backline. (1,2) is directly between me and Viper — a good trap location. I can move to (0,3) to stay at medium range and away from Viper (keep dist≥2), then trap (1,2) to catch Viper advancing.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,1) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 There's a trap at (1,2) blocking my north path. Viper is at (0,3) distance 3 - I need to avoid getting adjacent to them or my trap ability gets blocked. I should place a trap to control the approach path while staying safe. Moving to (1,3) would put me closer to Viper but still not adjacent. Better to move to (0,2) or (1,3) and place a trap on the chokepoint near (1,2) - but that tile already has a trap. I can place a trap at (0,2) to control Viper's movement path, but I need to move first to get in range. Moving to (2,1) and placing trap at (1,2) - already trapped. Let me move to (1,0) to reposition, then place a trap at (2,1) as a chokepoint between enemies and my allies at (2,2). Actually, moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (2,2) which is fine. From (1,1) I can place trap at range ≤2, so (1,3) is valid but has approach risk. Best: move to (2,1) to be near Bulwark for area control, then trap at (2,3) to block Insight's path toward our team.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,3) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction — moving would lose that. Insight (oracle) is at (2,4), just 2 tiles north. I can't attack from here (not adjacent), but I should hold position to keep fortify active. There's a trap at (2,3) blocking direct north movement. Prophet is wounded to my northeast. I'll stay put and use shield_wall northward to protect against Insight's threats to allies behind me.
  State: Viper 6/6, Bulwark 9/11, Prophet 3/10, Viper 6/6, Bolt 1/4, Insight 10/10

### Turn 3 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark and Prophet are already scanned. Enemy Viper at (2,1) is unscanned and healthy — top priority to scan for intel. Viper is dist=3, within scan range. Trap at (2,3) blocks direct south movement. I'm at full HP with no pressure. Scan Viper first for intel, then I can reposition. Moving to (3,3) after would give me flexibility while staying at range.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/10 HP — critically low. Bolt (critical HP) already has my position and will use precision_shot on me this turn per Foresight. I need to move first to dodge. Insight (enemy oracle) is at (3,3) distance 2 and hasn't been scanned yet — high value target. I should move to break Bolt's shot line then scan Insight to get their prompt for team intel. Moving to (4,4) keeps distance from Insight while staying in scan range. Bolt is at (4,5) and shoots toward (5,3) — moving away helps. Then scan Insight at (3,3) from (4,4), dist=2, within range.
- **Bolt** (striker): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded — priority kill. But precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy. Must use basic attack instead. At 1HP I'm critical, so after killing Prophet I should retreat. Move to (5,5) to escape, then attack won't reach... better to attack first then move. Attack Prophet at (4,4) to finish them, then move away from remaining threats to (5,4) or (3,5).
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Traps already at (2,3) and (1,2) blocking central approach. Enemies clustered at (2,1) and (2,2) — Bulwark healthy at dist 3, Viper wounded at dist 4. I can move to (1,3) to get closer for pulse range while staying outside denial range, then place a trap at (1,4) to block northern approach route to our backline at (3,3).
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with 3/6 HP, Viper is at (1,3) distance 3 (not adjacent so denial doesn't affect me). Traps already at (1,2) and (2,3). Viper is moving toward us. I should place a trap to control the approach path. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer to center while keeping distance from Viper. Then place a trap at (3,2) to block Insight's approach from (3,3) — or at (2,2) but Bulwark is there. Best trap location: (3,2) which is between Insight at (3,3) and our position, cutting off their advance. Move to (3,1) first, then trap at (3,2) which is within 2 tiles.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,1) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Enemies Viper @(1,3) and Insight @(3,3) are both 2 tiles away. Ally Viper is wounded at (3,1), Prophet is critical at (4,4). No enemies in melee range. Moving would lose fortify bonus. I should stay and use shield_wall to protect allies. Ally Viper is to my east at (3,1), threatened by enemy Insight at (3,3) from the north. I'll shield_wall north to block incoming threats from that direction, staying put to keep fortify active.
  State: Viper 3/6, Bulwark 9/11, Prophet 2/10, Viper 6/6, Bolt 1/4, Insight 7/10

### Turn 4 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/10 HP — critical danger. Bolt is adjacent at (5,4) and attacked me last turn. I must retreat first. Foresight shows Bolt will attack (4,4) again — I need to move away. Moving to (3,5) puts distance from Bolt and Viper. After moving, I can scan Viper at (1,3) — dist will be ~4 tiles from (3,5): dist = |3-1|+|5-3| = 2+2 = 4, still in range. Scanning Viper reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage. Insight is healthy but already known. This is the highest value scan target remaining.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,5) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is critical and already scanned — I can finish it with scan (1 dmg) since it's at dist 2. All enemies already scanned so no new intel needed. Prophet is at (3,5), dist 2, within scan range 4. Viper ally is at (1,3) which is 2 tiles away — not adjacent, so no blocking. I'm not adjacent to enemy Viper at (3,1) so scan is not blocked. Scan Prophet to deal 1 damage and potentially eliminate it (critical = likely 1-2 HP). Then move to (4,3) to stay safe and away from traps at (2,3).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 1HP — critically wounded. Both enemies are dist=5, out of range. No enemies in range to shoot. I need to survive: move to (5,5) to maintain high ground and distance, then wait. Retreat isn't strictly necessary since enemies are far, but I should reposition to a safer tile while staying in range for next turn. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to enemies without closing to attack range yet. Actually at 1HP I should stay back. (5,5) keeps distance and gives high ground. Wait after moving.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 3/6 HP, enemies not in range. Traps already at (1,2), (2,3), (3,2) covering some approaches. Insight is at (4,3) distance 3 - if I move to (4,2) I'd be adjacent and could deny abilities, but that puts me close to a healthy enemy at low HP. Better to move to (4,1) to get closer to Insight while staying safer, then place a trap at (4,2) to block Insight's path and potentially catch them. This controls the chokepoint between Insight and my current position. Trap at (4,2) is within 2 tiles of (4,1) and is an empty tile.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,3) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Enemy Viper is at (1,3), dist=2, not adjacent so can't attack. I should maintain my front line position. Moving would break fortify. The enemy Viper is to my NW at (1,3). I can shield_wall toward N to protect against threats coming from that direction. Staying put preserves fortify bonus and keeps me between allies and enemies.
- **Viper** (vector): move(0,3) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 3HP, critical condition. Bulwark is at (2,2) dist=2 and healthy - dangerous. Traps already at (2,3), (1,2), (1,4) blocking many paths. I need to stay alive. Moving to (0,3) gets me further from Bulwark. Then I can pulse Bulwark if they close in - but at dist=2 they're not adjacent yet so pulse won't reach. Better to move away to (0,3) and use trap on a path Bulwark might take. (0,2) or (0,4) are open. Actually valid moves include (0,2),(0,3),(0,4). Move to (0,3) to stay safe, then trap (1,3) to block my current position as a choke point for enemies approaching.
  State: Viper 3/6, Bulwark 9/11, Viper 3/6, Bolt 1/4, Insight 7/10 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → recalibrate(5,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Viper is wounded at (4,1), dist 2 — I can scan again to deal damage, but scan requires ≤4 tiles and Viper is at dist 2, so that works. However, the caution note says ally Viper is 2 tiles away at (0,3) — moving adjacent to ally Viper won't block my abilities, only enemy Vector blocks scan. Enemy Viper at (4,1) is the denial threat. I'm at (4,3), enemy Viper at (4,1) is dist 2 — not adjacent so scan is not blocked. I can scan Viper to deal 1 damage (finishing them off if wounded enough) or scan Bulwark. Bolt is critical and needs help. Let me recalibrate Bolt — but Bolt is at (5,5) and I'm at (4,3), that's dist 3, recalibrate is adjacent only. I could move toward Bolt first. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Bolt at (5,5) and I can recalibrate. But (5,4) is a valid move. From (5,4) I'd be dist 2 from Viper at (4,1) — still not adjacent so scan not blocked. Let me move to (5,4) then recalibrate Bolt to help them survive. Bolt is critical and getting recalibrated intel could help them act better.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP critical — survival is paramount. No enemies are in range from current position. Valid moves are [3,5],[4,4],[4,5],[5,3]. Moving to (5,3) keeps me at max distance from Viper at (4,1) while staying at edge. Actually (4,5) or (3,5) keeps me further north/away. Viper is at (4,1), so moving to (3,5) increases distance. I cannot reach either enemy this turn anyway. Best move: go to (3,5) to reposition for a future shot while staying away from threats. Then wait — no valid targets in range.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 3/6 HP, wounded. No enemies in range. Trap at (4,2) already placed. I need to reposition and place more traps to control approach routes. Insight is at (5,4) distance 4 - moving to (5,2) would put me closer and let me place a trap at (5,3) to block Insight's approach. Or move to (4,3) and trap (5,3). Let me move to (5,2) - valid move - then place trap at (5,3) to cut off Insight's path southward.
- **Viper** (vector): move(0,1) ✓ → trap(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,3) with 3/6 HP, wounded. Bulwark is at (2,2) distance 3, approaching. I have traps at (2,3), (1,2), (1,4), (1,3) already placed — good coverage. The path from Bulwark at (2,2) toward my backline (allies at (3,5) and (5,4)) could go through (1,2) or (1,3) which are already trapped. I need to stay safe. Moving to (0,2) or (0,1) keeps me out of range while maintaining denial pressure if enemies close in. I can't place more traps on already-trapped tiles. Let me look at gaps: (0,2), (0,4) are open. Bulwark is healthy and at dist 3 — it could reach me next turn. I should move away to (0,1) to stay safe and place a trap at (0,2) to cover retreat path, but wait — I'm adjacent to... checking: Bulwark is at (2,2), not adjacent to me at (0,3). So trap is NOT blocked. I can place a trap at (0,2) to protect my retreat. Move to (0,1) first, then trap (0,2) to cover the approach.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,2) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies are in range. The closest threat is Viper at (0,1) dist=3 to the west. My ally Viper is at (5,2) to the east. Orders say hold the front line and use shield_wall toward incoming threats. I should stay put to keep Fortify active and use shield_wall facing west (toward enemy Viper) to protect any nearby allies from that direction. Waiting/ability only preserves my fortified status.

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → recalibrate(3,5) ✓
  💭 Viper is at (5,2), distance 2, within scan range (≤4). Already scanned so no need to scan again. Both enemies already scanned. Ally Bolt is critical at (3,5). I should recalibrate Bolt to help them survive. Bolt is at (3,5), I'm at (5,4) — that's distance 3, not adjacent. Need to move adjacent to Bolt first. Moving to (4,5) gets me adjacent to Bolt at (3,5). Then recalibrate Bolt. Also need to avoid moving adjacent to ally Viper at (0,1) — not an issue here. Viper enemy is placing trap at (5,3) this turn per Foresight — avoid moving to (5,3). Move to (4,5) is safe and available.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical survival priority. I need to move away from enemies. Valid moves include (4,4) and (5,5) which take me further east/northeast away from threats. Enemy Viper is at dist 5 (out of range), Bulwark at dist 4 (in range but healthy — not worth engaging at 1HP). Moving to (5,5) maximizes distance from Bulwark at (2,2) and the trap clusters. No ability worth using — don't shoot the healthy Sentinel when Viper is out of range and I need to survive.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → pulse(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 3HP, wounded. Bolt is critical at (5,5) dist=3, Insight is healthy at (4,5) dist=4. There's already a trap at (5,3) between me and Bolt - good. I need to move north toward enemies to get in range, but I'm low HP. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to the trap at (5,3)... wait, I can move through my own traps safely. Moving to (4,3) then placing a trap could work. Actually, Bolt is critical and at (5,5) - if I move to (5,4) I'm dist=1 from Bolt and can attack or pulse. But (5,3) has a trap - enemies stepping there get hit. Let me move to (4,3) to avoid my own trap at (5,3), then place a trap at (4,4) to block the path between Insight/Bolt and our position. Actually moving to (5,4) requires passing through (5,3) trap - I should check if I trigger my own traps. Safe to assume I don't trigger allied traps. Move to (5,4) gets me adjacent to Bolt at (5,5) - I can pulse for 1dmg to all within 1 tile (hitting Bolt, possibly Insight if they're adjacent). Pulse from (5,4) hits (5,5) Bolt and (4,5) Insight both within 1 tile! That's excellent - both enemies in pulse range.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,1) ✓ → trap(2,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at (2,2), dist 3 — closest threat. There are already traps at (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) covering paths toward my position. (0,2) is also trapped. Valid moves include (2,1) which gets me closer to Bulwark and could let me trap or pulse, but I'm at 3/6 HP so I shouldn't overextend. The path from Bulwark toward me likely goes through (1,1) or (2,1). I can move to (1,1) to set a trap at (2,1) or (1,0) to further deny approach. Let me move to (2,1) to place a trap on (2,2)... wait, can't trap occupied tile. Bulwark is at (2,2). I'll move to (1,1) and trap (2,1) to block the approach corridor since (1,2) is already trapped.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction — valuable to maintain. Enemy Viper is at (1,1), dist 2, not adjacent so can't attack yet. I should move to (1,2) to get adjacent to enemy Viper and attack, but (1,2) is a trap tile. Moving to (2,1) puts me closer without a trap. Actually, I should consider staying fortified for the damage reduction since enemy is close. If I move to (1,2) it's a trap — avoid. (3,1) gets me closer to enemy without traps and maintains front line. Better: move to (2,1) to close distance toward (1,1), then next turn I can be adjacent. But I lose fortify. Alternatively, wait to keep fortify bonus and use shield_wall toward the enemy Viper at SW direction. Viper is at (1,1) which is SW of me — direction S or W. Shield wall protects adjacent allies from a direction. My ally Viper is at (5,4), not adjacent. No adjacent allies to shield. Best play: move to (1,2) is trapped. Move to (3,1) is safe, closer to front. Or stay fortified and wait — no adjacent allies to protect, no adjacent enemies to attack. I'll move to (2,1) to approach enemy Viper, positioning to attack next turn, accepting loss of fortify.
  State: Viper 3/6, Bulwark 7/11, Viper 3/6, Insight 7/10 | Dead: Prophet, Bolt

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper(vector,E) is at (5,4), wounded and already scanned. I'm at (4,5). I can move to (5,5) to stay at distance 1 from Viper but that puts me adjacent — bad, blocks my scan. Better to move to (3,5) to maintain distance and then recalibrate ally Viper at (1,1)... but (1,1) is not adjacent to (3,5). Actually ally Viper is at (1,1), far away. Let me reconsider. Enemy Viper at (5,4) is already scanned. Bulwark at (2,1) is out of range. My best move: recalibrate is range adjacent only, so I need an ally adjacent. Ally Viper is at (1,1), too far. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. I should move closer to support position or scan enemy Viper again isn't needed (already known). Since both enemies are scanned, I should position defensively. Move to (3,4) to stay safe and wait — keeps distance from enemy Viper and avoids trap tiles. Traps at (2,3),(1,2),(1,4),(1,3),(0,2) — (3,4) is clear. Actually I can move to (3,5) which is in valid moves and safe, then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(1,1) ✓ → move(0,0) ✓
  💭 Bulwark sentinel is adjacent at (2,1) - I can pulse to hit it for 1 damage. I'm at 3/6 HP and wounded, so I should be careful. The area around me has traps at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (0,2) blocking escape routes north. Bulwark is healthy and adjacent - pulse hits all units within 1 tile so it will hit Bulwark. After pulsing, I should move away to create distance. Moving to (0,0) or (2,0) gets me away from Bulwark. Let me move to (2,0) to stay at range while keeping denial pressure, then pulse to hit Bulwark. Actually pulse first while adjacent, then move to (0,0) to retreat from Bulwark.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,1) with 50% damage reduction. Enemy Viper is at (0,0), distance 3 — not in attack range. I should advance toward the enemy to intercept while maintaining fortify next turn if possible. Moving to (1,1) closes distance to Viper to 2 tiles, keeping me between allies and enemies. I'll wait as second action to preserve fortify next round if I don't move again.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 3HP, wounded. Insight is 3 tiles away at (3,5) - closest threat. I need to close distance or place traps to control approach. Trap at (5,3) already exists. I can move to (4,4) to get closer to Insight and place a trap at (4,5) or (3,4) to block Insight's movement south. Moving to (4,4) then trapping (3,4) creates a barrier between Insight and our position. Bulwark is at (1,1) wounded - Viper is distant at (0,0). Priority: pressure Insight while controlling terrain.
  State: Viper 3/6, Bulwark 6/11, Viper 3/6, Insight 7/10 | Dead: Prophet, Bolt

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper(vector) at (4,4) is wounded and within scan range (dist 2). I already know their prompt, so scanning again would waste the action. Instead, I should scan to deal 1 damage and finish off or weaken them further. Bulwark is at (1,1) far away and out of range. My ally Viper is at (0,0) wounded — I should consider recalibrating them but they're 3+ tiles away. Best play: scan Viper at (4,4) to deal damage (they're wounded, this could be lethal or near-lethal), then consider repositioning. I'll stay at range and not move adjacent to my ally Viper at (0,0). Current position (3,5) is good — scan Viper first, then wait or reposition.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,0) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (1,1) with 50% damage reduction — moving would lose that. Viper is 2 tiles away at (0,0), so I shouldn't move adjacent. No enemies in melee range. Best play is to stay fortified and use shield_wall to protect allies from the south where Viper threatens.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,0) ✓ → attack(1,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded at (1,1), distance 2 - within attack range. I'm at 3/6 HP. I have traps at many positions already. Best play: attack Bulwark directly (1dmg, adjacent range... wait, attack is adjacent only and dist=2). Range 2 means trap works. Place trap at (1,1)? No, trap goes on empty tile. Bulwark is there. I can use pulse if within 1 tile, but Bulwark is at dist 2. Move to (1,0) to get adjacent, then pulse or attack. (1,0) is in valid moves. From (1,0), Bulwark at (1,1) is distance 1 - adjacent, so attack works. Move to (1,0) then attack Bulwark for 1dmg. Wounded sentinel might die or be near death. This is optimal.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is already scanned and at dist 6, out of range. No enemies in scan range. Viper is wounded at (1,0) and about to attack Bulwark at (1,1). I can recalibrate Viper but they're at (1,0) and I'm at (3,5) — not adjacent. Best move is to reposition closer to the action. Move toward (2,4) to get into better scan/recalibrate range next turn. No valid ability targets this turn.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(1,0) ✓ → move(3,0) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,1), wounded. I'm at 3/6 HP. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - that's Bulwark. Then move away to safety at (3,0) to escape the wounded sentinel and maintain area denial.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,1) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,1) with 4/11 HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). No enemies in range. Viper is at (3,0) dist=3, Insight at (2,4) dist=4. I should hold position to keep fortify active and use shield_wall to protect allies from the east where enemies are. Staying put preserves fortify. I'll shield_wall facing East to block incoming damage to adjacent allies.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(1,1) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at distance 4, exactly in scan range. Already scanned so prompt is known. Bulwark is wounded and holding position with shield_wall facing E. Viper is wounded at (3,0). I should recalibrate Viper to give tactical guidance — but Viper is at (3,0) and I'm at (2,4), not adjacent. I can't reach Viper in one move to be adjacent. Best action: scan Bulwark to deal 1 damage (it's wounded, finishing pressure helps). Then move to safety away from traps at (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3) — move to (3,5) which is safe and maintains range.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,0) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at (1,1) critical health, dist=3. I'm at (3,0) at 3HP. No enemies in range currently. I have traps clustered around (1,2)-(2,3) area already. Bulwark is heading W/critical so likely not a major threat. I should reposition to better coverage and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (2,1) gets me closer while maintaining distance, then trap (2,0) or (3,1) to cover approach routes to my backline at (3,5). Actually, moving to (4,0) keeps me safe and I can trap (3,1) to cover mid-board approaches.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2/11 HP, I'm critically wounded. Fortified gives me 50% damage reduction while stationary — I should preserve this. No enemies in range. Viper is at dist=4 to the east, Insight at dist=6. Holding position maintains fortify bonus and keeps me on the front line between allies and enemies. Wait to preserve fortify.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at distance 6, out of scan range (max 4). No enemies in range. Viper is wounded at (4,0) and hit a trap. I should move closer to Bulwark to get within scan range next turn, while staying safe. Moving to (2,3) would hit a trap. Best move is toward (2,4) or (3,3) to close distance. Let me move to (3,3) to get closer without hitting traps.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,1) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/11 HP, fortified, with 50% damage reduction. Both enemies are 4 tiles away. I should maintain fortify by not moving, and use shield_wall to protect allies. Viper is at (4,0) to my east/southeast, Insight at (3,3) to my northeast. Moving would lose fortify which is critical at low HP. I'll wait to keep fortify active and use shield_wall facing east toward the enemy threat.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,0) ✓ → trap(2,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,0) with 3HP, critical health. Bulwark is at (1,1) and is critical too - it's moving toward our position. My traps are already heavily placed in the center-left area. I should place a trap to intercept Bulwark's likely path. Bulwark at (1,1) moving west/toward us will likely pass through (2,0) or (3,1) area. (3,1) is already trapped. I can move to (3,0) to get closer range, then trap (2,0) to block the bottom path approach. Actually, I'm adjacent-blocked from trapping if enemy is within 1 tile - Bulwark is at dist 4 so I'm fine. Let me move to (3,0) first to shorten distance, then place a trap at (2,0) to block the bottom corridor approach.
