## Squads
### Player
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Patch** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
### Opponent
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move north toward the enemy line. Bolt (striker) is the priority target. All enemies are far; I'll use this turn to cloak and advance under cover.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with both enemies in scan range. Patch at (2,1) dist=3 is closer and likely a support unit — scanning them reveals their prompt and deals damage, disrupting healing. Then I'll move to maintain distance. No allies are wounded so recalibrate isn't needed.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Orders say maintain distance and use precision_shot on high-value targets (medics first). Patch is the priority target at dist=5. Moving toward Patch to get within range-3. From (4,4), I can move 2 tiles. Moving to (4,2) brings me to dist=3 from Patch at (2,1) — that's exactly in range for precision_shot. Let me verify: from (4,2) to (2,1) = |4-2|+|4-1|... wait, that's Manhattan dist = 2+1 = 3, which is within rng3. But High Ground passive gives +1 range if no adjacent enemy, so effective range is 4. I'll move to (4,2) and then use precision_shot on Patch.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, no allies are wounded so no healing needed. Enemies are 3-5 tiles away. I should position myself closer to allies for support while staying safe. Move toward (2,2) to stay near Warden sentinel at (2,0) and be ready to heal next turn. No ability to use this turn since all allies are full HP and no adjacent allies to overclock.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Nearest enemy is Bolt at (4,2), dist=4. Move toward Bolt: from (2,0) I can move 2 tiles. Best path toward (4,2): move to (3,1) then (4,0) gets me to dist=2 from Bolt. Actually (3,1) is dist=3 from Bolt, better than staying. Move to (3,1) to advance. Enemies are mostly to the N/NE, so shield_wall facing N after moving.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 Both enemies are 4 tiles away. I can move 2 tiles toward them. Moving to (3,3) advances directly toward Warden at (3,1) and Patch at (2,2). No adjacent enemies so no attack possible. After moving, I'll use shield_wall facing S (toward enemies to the south of my new position) to protect allies.
  State: Warden 12/12, Wraith 4/4, Patch 5/9, Warden 12/12, Watcher 10/10, Bolt 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 Patch is already scanned and within range at dist 3. Wraith (specter) cloaked and moved to (0,3) last turn — adjacent to me at (1,4), I need to avoid being adjacent to enemies. Wraith is at (0,3), which is distance 2 from my current position (1,4). I should move away from Wraith to avoid adjacency issues and stay safe. Moving to (3,4) gets me further from Wraith and keeps Patch in scan range (dist from 3,4 to 2,2 = 3). Enemy Warden is at (3,1), dist 5 from current — still out of scan range. I'll scan Patch again... wait, Patch already scanned. Better to move toward enemy Warden to get within scan range. From (3,4), Warden at (3,1) is dist 3 — within scan range! Move to (3,4) then scan Warden at (3,1).
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked at (0,3) facing N. Orders say to assassinate the enemy damage dealer (Bolt, striker) but it's too far. The Watcher (oracle) is the next priority — I can reach (2,4) which is directly behind it (Watcher faces E, so behind is to the W at (2,4)). Moving there positions me for a breach next turn. I'll move to (2,4) to get behind the Watcher and stay cloaked.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is a wounded medic — priority target. I'm at (4,2), Patch is at (2,2), dist=2, within precision_shot range. No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive may apply. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Fire on Patch first to finish off the wounded medic, then move to maintain distance.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → patch(3,1) ✓
  💭 Allied Warden at (3,1) is wounded (10/12 HP) and needs healing. I'm at (2,2), Warden is at (3,1) - distance 2, not adjacent. I need to move adjacent to heal. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to enemy Warden at (3,3) which could block abilities. Moving to (2,1) gets me distance 2 from allied Warden - still not adjacent. Best move is to (3,2) to be adjacent to allied Warden at (3,1) for heal, but that puts me next to enemy Warden at (3,3) which blocks patch. Try (2,1) - adjacent to (3,1)? No, dist=2. I need to be at (3,1)±1 or (2,1) which is diagonal. Actually adjacent means distance=1 (Manhattan or Chebyshev?). Let me reconsider: allied Warden at (3,1), I need to be at (2,1),(4,1),(3,0),(3,2) to be adjacent. (3,2) is in valid moves but adjacent to enemy Warden at (3,3) - patch blocked. (2,1) is in valid moves, adjacent to (3,1)? Manhattan dist = |2-3|+|1-1|=1, yes adjacent! And enemy Warden is at (3,3), dist from (2,1) = |2-3|+|1-3|=3, not adjacent - so patch won't be blocked. Move to (2,1) then patch allied Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Warden at (3,3), distance 2. I can move to (3,2) to get adjacent, then use shield_wall facing North where enemies cluster (Warden was N of me, Watcher further N). Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Warden at (3,3). Then attack.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. If I attack first, I deal damage. If I move, I lose fortify. Best play: attack Warden now, then use shield_wall facing south (toward enemies at (3,2) and (2,1)) to protect allies while keeping fortify by not moving.
  State: Warden 11/12, Wraith 4/4, Patch 3/9, Warden 11/12, Watcher 10/10, Bolt 4/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are already scanned — no new scan targets needed. Wraith (specter) is unscanned at (2,4) from last turn's foresight. I should reposition to scan Wraith. From current (3,4), Wraith was at (2,4) — that's distance 1, but specter means cloaked/adjacent risk. I need to find Wraith's current position. Foresight shows Wraith moved to (2,4) last round and waited. Wraith is likely still near (2,4). If I stay at (3,4), Wraith at (2,4) is distance 1 — adjacent, which means scan is blocked if it's a Vector. But Wraith is a specter, not a vector. Scan blocked only by adjacent Vector. Specter doesn't block scan. So I can scan Wraith from (3,4) at dist 1. That reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage. Let me scan Wraith at (2,4).
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 1HP, cloaked with 1 turn remaining. I need to use this cloak wisely. Position (3,4) is behind both Warden (facing S) and Watcher (facing E). The orders say to prioritize the enemy damage dealer. Watcher is the oracle (damage dealer) and I can breach it from (3,4) — that's adjacent and behind. I should move to (3,4) and breach Watcher. At 1HP I need to eliminate threats fast. Breach the Watcher to control it next turn, preventing its damage.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say medics first, then damage dealers. Patch (medic) is at dist=4, out of my range-3. Wraith (specter, critical) also at dist=4, out of range. Only Warden (sentinel) is in range at dist=2. Orders say maintain distance — Warden is adjacent-ish at dist=2, which is within my range-3. I should use precision_shot on Warden since it's the only target in range. But orders say medics first — Patch is wounded at dist=4. I could move closer to Patch. From (5,2), moving to (4,1) gets me closer to Patch at (2,1): dist would be sqrt(4+0)=2 tiles manhattan = |4-2|+|1-1|=2+0=2, that puts Patch in range! Let me check: from (4,1) to (2,1) = dist 2, in range. And Wraith at (3,4) from (4,1) = |4-3|+|1-4|=1+3=4, still out of range. Move to (4,1) first, then precision_shot Patch (medic, wounded = high priority). Also need LoS check — no walls mentioned, assuming clear. Warden sentinel at (3,2) is not adjacent to (4,1) so precision_shot not blocked.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → patch(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with only 2HP — critically low. My ally Warden is at (3,2) wounded (11/12) and adjacent ally Wraith is at (3,4) with only 1HP critical. I need to close distance to heal. Bolt enemy is at (4,1) dist=2, threatening me. I should move toward Warden at (3,2) — moving to (3,1) gets me adjacent to Warden at (3,2). Then I can patch Warden. But Wraith at 1HP is more critical. Moving to (3,1) puts me dist=3 from Wraith, still too far. Let me move to (2,2) then (3,2) — wait, mv=2 so I can reach (3,1) in one move (dist=2 via Manhattan). From (3,1) I'm adjacent to Warden at (3,2) — I can patch them. But Wraith at 1HP is the priority. From (3,1), Wraith is at dist=3, can't reach. I'll move to (3,1) and patch Warden since I can reach them, keeping frontliner alive per orders.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent: Warden (sentinel, healthy) at (3,2) and Wraith (specter, critical) at (3,4). Priority: kill the critical Wraith first to eliminate a threat. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Wraith to finish it off, then shield_wall facing S to protect against Warden and Patch below.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) E ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Patch is critical at (3,1) and needs protection. Attack Warden first, then use shield_wall facing N to protect Patch from Bolt at (4,1) — actually Bolt is to the E. Use shield_wall facing E to cover Patch from Bolt and Watcher threats. Wait, shield_wall protects adjacent allies from a direction. Patch is at (3,1), south of me. I should attack Warden (adjacent, north) then shield_wall facing E to block Bolt.
  State: Warden 12/12, Patch 2/9, Warden 10/12, Watcher 10/10, Bolt 4/4 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 4 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am breached — orders say move away from allies and do not use abilities. Allies are at (3,3) and (4,1). I should move away from them. (5,5) puts me far from both allies and out of immediate danger.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/9 HP which is critical. Bolt (enemy striker) is adjacent at (4,1) - dangerous. Warden ally is at (3,2) at full HP, no healing needed. I have 1 heal left. My patch is blocked if I'm adjacent to enemy Vector, but I see no Vector here. I need to survive. Moving away from Bolt is priority - move to (2,1) to escape the striker. From there I'm safe and can assess. No healing needed since ally is full HP.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,1) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Patch is critical priority — medic at dist=2, critical HP. I'm at (4,1), Patch at (2,1). Precision_shot range ≤3, dist=2, I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive applies. Shoot Patch first to eliminate the healer, then move to maintain distance from Warden at (3,2).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I should attack the Warden. If I don't move, I keep Fortify active. Attack first, then wait to maintain fortification.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) to my north. I'm fortified (50% DR). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Warden. Since I'm not moving, fortify stays active. After attacking, use shield_wall facing north where Warden is.
  State: Warden 11/12, Warden 9/12, Watcher 10/10, Bolt 4/4 | Dead: Wraith, Patch

### Turn 5 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am breached — must move away from allies and not use abilities. Allies are at (3,3) and (5,1). I need to move away from them. Moving to (5,2) keeps me near Bolt at (5,1) — bad. Moving to (2,5) or (3,5) moves away from both. (2,5) maximizes distance from both allies. I'll move there and wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is at (3,2), dist=3, in range for precision_shot. I'm at full HP with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive gives +1 range (not needed here). No adjacent enemy means precision_shot is not blocked. I'll fire precision_shot for 2dmg without moving first (to avoid the 1dmg penalty from moving). Stay at (5,1) and shoot.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2) - directly south. Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so I should stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack the Warden, then wait to maintain fortify.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) to my north. I'm fortified but orders say attack adjacent enemies. If I attack first, I deal damage. Then I can use shield_wall facing north (toward Warden and Watcher beyond) to protect any allies from that direction. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
  State: Warden 9/12, Warden 8/12, Watcher 10/10, Bolt 4/4 | Dead: Wraith, Patch

### Turn 6 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am breached — orders say move away from allies and do not use abilities. Allies are at (3,3) and (5,1). I should move away from them. Moving to (0,5) maximizes distance from both allies.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden sentinel is at (3,2), distance 3 — exactly at max range. I'm at (5,1) with full HP and no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive gives +1 range (effective range 4). No enemies adjacent so precision_shot is not blocked. I should use precision_shot on the Warden for 2 damage. I haven't moved this turn so full damage applies. Staying at (5,1) maintains distance per orders.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2) directly south. I'm fortified and have 50% damage reduction. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack the Warden at (3,2), then use shield_wall facing south (toward the enemy) to protect myself and adjacent allies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Warden. After attacking, I can use shield_wall facing north (toward Warden) to protect against further damage, or stay fortified. Actually, if I use my ability (attack) and don't move, I keep fortify. Bolt is at (5,1) to my east, Watcher at (0,5) to my northwest — most enemies are roughly east/north. Attack Warden first, then shield_wall facing north to block Warden's next attack.
  State: Warden 7/12, Warden 7/12, Watcher 10/10, Bolt 4/4 | Dead: Wraith, Patch

### Turn 7 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(3,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is at (3,2), distance 6 — out of scan range (max 4). No enemies in range from current position. Ally Warden is wounded at (3,3). I should move closer to bring the enemy Warden into scan range and get closer to ally Warden for recalibrate. Moving to (3,5) puts me at distance 3 from enemy Warden — within scan range. From (3,5) I can then scan the enemy Warden or recalibrate ally Warden at (3,3) which is 2 tiles away (not adjacent, so recalibrate won't work). Actually from (3,5) ally Warden at (3,3) is 2 tiles — not adjacent. Enemy Warden at (3,2) from (3,5) is distance 3 — within scan range. I already know enemy Warden's prompt, so scan would just deal 1 damage. Let me move to (3,5) and scan the enemy Warden to deal damage.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is at (3,2), dist=3, wounded. I'm at (5,1) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive gives +1 range (effective range 4). Warden is within range 3, so precision_shot is valid. I haven't moved yet, so full 2dmg applies. Fire precision_shot first, then hold position to maintain distance.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden enemy is adjacent at (3,3) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Warden first. For shield_wall, enemies are mostly to the north/east, so N facing makes sense. But attacking the adjacent Warden is higher priority per orders. I'll attack Warden then use shield_wall facing N to block damage from Watcher who is also to the north.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Warden. I can also use shield_wall facing south toward the enemy, but attacking is higher priority since they're adjacent and wounded. Attack first, then shield_wall facing south to reduce incoming damage while staying fortified.
