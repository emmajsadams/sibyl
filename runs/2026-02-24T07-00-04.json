Let me move to (2,4) to stay at medium range and place a trap at (3,5) to cut off Veil's retreat northward, or I can trap (2,2) to cover Hawk's approach. Hawk is at (2,0) moving north — trapping (2,1) or (2,2) would intercept. I can reach (2,2) with a move.

But if I move first, precision_shot does only 1dmg. Better to shoot first (2dmg) then move away. Shooting Deadeye at dist=1 with precision_shot = 2dmg, which would finish a 4HP enemy only if they're at 2HP or less — they're healthy (4HP), so 2dmg brings them to 2HP. Alternatively shoot Viper at dist=2 for 2dmg. Orders say target most wounded — both are healthy. No medic present.

Moving to (5,2) gets me within range 2 of Viper at (4,3) - dist would be sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, so adjacent almost. Actually (5,2) to (4,3) is dist ~1.4, within range 2. I can place a trap at (4,2) or (5,3) to block Viper's movement south. Let me move to (5,1) first - that's a valid move tile - then trap at (5,2) or (4,1). Wait, (4,1) already has a trap.

I should use pulse if Hawk gets adjacent, but Hawk is at dist=2 so pulse won't hit. Best play: trap a tile Hawk must cross to reach me, then reposition. Hawk is at (2,3) moving toward me. If I stay at (4,3), Hawk could move to (3,3) then attack. I should move away to (5,4) to gain distance, and place a trap at (4,3) or on Hawk's approach path. Trap at (3,3) would catch Hawk moving toward me. But (3,2) is a valid move tile - trap range is ≤2 tiles from current pos (4,3), so (3,3) is within range. Place trap at (3,3) to block Hawk's approach, then move to (5,4) for safety.",
