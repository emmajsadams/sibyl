Actually, let me pulse first — Longshot is at dist=2, outside pulse range (1 tile AoE). Attack is range adjacent only. My attack range is adjacent (1 tile), but Longshot is at dist=2. Pulse hits within 1 tile. So I can't directly attack Longshot from here. I need to move closer. Valid moves include (5,1) which is adjacent to Longshot at (5,2) — but that's also closer to Viper at (5,3) dist would be 2, still not adjacent so denial won't apply. From (5,1) I could attack Longshot (adjacent). But wait — traps at (4,2) and (4,3). Moving to (5,1) avoids those. From (5,1), Longshot is at (5,2) — adjacent, I can attack.
