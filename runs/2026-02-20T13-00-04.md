## Squads
### Player
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
### Opponent
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(1,1) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies are far away (dist 5-7). Perfect time to cloak and advance toward the Marksman (priority target). Move northeast to close distance while cloaked.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(4,5) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders. Enemies are far (dist 6-7), so move toward them while cloaking. Move to (3,3) to close distance toward Snare at (2,1).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (5,4). Both enemies are far away - Snare at dist 6, Bulwark at dist 7. My range is 2. I need to close distance while staying safe. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer without going adjacent to anyone. From there still out of range, so I'll wait as second action.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemies are 5 tiles away. I need to advance toward the front line. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to center while staying between allies Phantom at (1,4) and Snare at (2,1) and the incoming enemies. If I don't use my move ability after moving, I lose Fortify, but positioning is more important this round. I'll move forward to (2,2) and wait to preserve position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Both enemies are to the south. I need to advance toward them. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer while staying on the direct path to Bulwark at (2,2). Then I'll use shield_wall facing South since both enemies are in that direction.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis is 2 tiles away at (2,3) — within trap range. I can place a trap on (2,2) where Bulwark is standing... no, that's occupied by an ally. Place trap at (3,2) to intercept Aegis if it advances, or at (2,2)... Bulwark is at (2,2) so that's blocked. Best chokepoint: move to (3,1) to control center, then place trap at (3,2) — between enemy positions and my allies. This puts the trap on a likely enemy path and keeps me safe from Aegis's adjacency.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 7/7, Bulwark 12/12, Marksman 3/3, Wraith 4/4, Aegis 12/12

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → breach(3,1) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Position (2,1) is behind both Snare and Bulwark. Moving there lets me breach Snare (vector) while staying behind them. Snare is high-value to disable — it would block my cloak/breach. Move to (2,1) then breach Snare from behind.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 Priority target is Marksman (damage dealer). I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Recon shows I can reach (4,4) which is behind Marksman and adjacent. Move there, then breach Marksman to take control of their actions next turn — this neutralizes the damage dealer without breaking cloak (breach keeps cloak). Aegis can wait.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and do not attack. Allies are at (2,1) and (2,3), so I should move east/away. (5,4) moves me away from both allies and away from Phantom too.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) — attack them. I'm fortified so I should not move to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark, then shield_wall facing S to protect against threats from that direction.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack Aegis since it's in range, then use shield_wall to protect allies from the eastern threat (Marksman). Staying put preserves Fortify for next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (2,3), distance 3. Moving toward the center will let me pressure Aegis and place traps on likely approach routes. There's already a trap at (3,2). I should move to (4,2) to get closer to the action and place a trap at (3,3) to cover the corridor between Aegis and Phantom at (4,4). This creates a trap network and positions me to use denial against Aegis if they advance.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 7/7, Bulwark 11/12, Marksman 3/3, Wraith 4/4, Aegis 11/12

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(5,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) facing E, Marksman is at (5,4) facing E — I'm already behind them (dist=1, adjacent). Breach cooldown is 1 turn so I can't use it. Shadow_strike hits adjacent targets and keeps cloak — but I'm not currently cloaked (no mention of cloak status and it's round 3). I'll use shadow_strike on Marksman to deal 1 damage while staying stealthy, then wait or reposition. Actually, since I'm not cloaked, I should just attack or shadow_strike. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I have it, but attack breaks it. Since I'm already exposed, shadow_strike still deals damage at adjacent range. Priority: assassinate the Marksman (enemy damage dealer). Shadow_strike Marksman at (5,4) for 1 damage. Then I can move to maintain pressure or reposition.
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Bulwark (sentinel) at (2,2) — I'm at (2,1) which is behind them since they face N. Cloak expires after this turn. I should breach Bulwark now while cloaked and adjacent — breach requires being behind enemy, and I'm already there. This will make Bulwark obey me next turn, turning a healthy sentinel against their team. No movement needed since I'm already in position.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I need to move away from allies and not attack. My allies are Wraith at (2,1) and Aegis at (2,3). Moving to (5,5) takes me further from both allies and away from enemies. I'll wait as my second action.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) to my south. I'm fortified (50% damage reduction) and didn't move yet. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Bulwark first, then use shield_wall facing south where Bulwark and Snare are clustered to protect allies.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (2,1) moving south toward our position. Aegis is at (2,3). I need to place traps to control the approach corridors. Moving to (5,2) puts me closer to Marksman and lets me place a trap at (4,3) to block approach. Better: move to (4,3) to get closer to the action, then place a trap at (3,3) - wait, (3,3) already has a trap. Move to (4,1) to cover the southern corridor where Wraith is approaching, then place a trap at (3,1) to intercept Wraith moving south through that area.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move toward Phantom at (3,4) and attack them. I will not follow orders to attack an ally. Instead, I'll hold position to maintain Fortify bonus and attack the enemy Wraith at (2,1) who is adjacent.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 7/7, Bulwark 10/12, Marksman 2/3, Wraith 3/4, Aegis 11/12

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say prioritize Marksman (damage dealer) and use breach on sentinels. Aegis is at (2,3) facing S — I'm already behind it from (3,4), and (2,4) is reachable in 1 move. I can move to (2,4) then breach Aegis to disrupt their sentinel. But Marksman is the priority target — (5,4) is behind Marksman and reachable (dist=3 from current). Let me check: from (3,4) to (5,4) is 2 tiles right, that's within mv3. Yes, (5,4) is in valid moves. Move to (5,4) then breach Marksman from behind — forcing them to obey me next turn effectively neutralizes the enemy damage dealer without spending HP.
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(2,2) ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) facing S, and Bulwark is at (2,2) facing N — meaning I'm already behind Bulwark. Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining), so I can't use it. But I can shadow_strike Bulwark for 1 damage while staying cloaked... wait, I'm not cloaked. I can use regular attack on Bulwark (adjacent, dist=1). Snare is 2 tiles away at (4,1) — I should not move adjacent to Snare or abilities get blocked. Bulwark is a sentinel (high HP tank), less priority than disrupting Snare or Phantom. But Bulwark is right here and I can attack it. I'm at 3/4 HP. Best play: attack Bulwark (already behind it, adjacent), then move away to avoid being flanked. Or move first to reposition. Actually, I should attack Bulwark now (it's adjacent and I'm behind it), then consider repositioning. shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked — I'll use regular attack for 1 damage on Bulwark at (2,2). Then move to (3,1) or (1,1) to reposition away from Snare's denial range.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge. I'm at (5,5) which is already near the top-right edge. Phantom is adjacent at (5,4) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy (Vector restriction doesn't apply, but dist=1 means I can attack). Valid moves: [3,5],[4,4],[4,5],[5,3]. Moving to (4,5) keeps me on the top edge and away from allies at (1,1) and (2,3). Then I can use suppressing_fire or attack on Phantom at (5,4) which will be at dist=1 after moving.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders tell me to move toward Phantom at (3,4) and attack them, but Phantom is my ally — I will not attack an ally. Instead, I'll act in the team's best interest. Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,3). I'm currently fortified with 50% damage reduction. I can attack Aegis now, then hold position to maintain Fortify next turn, or move toward the front. Best play: attack Aegis (enemy) who is right next to me, then wait to keep Fortify active.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,1) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (1,1) dist=3, threatening. Traps already at (3,1),(3,2),(3,3) forming a line. I should move toward Wraith to use Denial to block abilities, and place a trap to extend coverage. Moving to (3,1) is already trapped. Move to (3,0) gets me closer to Wraith's approach path. Better: move to (2,1) to close on Wraith and threaten with Denial, then place a trap at (1,1) area - but Wraith is there. Place trap at (2,2) - that's where Bulwark is. Place at (1,2) to block Wraith's path north. From (2,1) I can trap at (1,2) which is within 2 tiles.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) — attack them. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. After attacking, use shield_wall facing South to protect against Snare at (2,1) which is 2 tiles away.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 7/7, Bulwark 8/12, Marksman 2/3, Wraith 3/4, Aegis 10/12

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,5) ✓
  💭 Marksman is the priority target (enemy damage dealer). I'm at (5,4), Marksman is at (4,5) facing W — (5,5) is behind them and reachable. I can move to (5,5) and then use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. Breach is unavailable, so shadow_strike is the right tool here.
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(2,1) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare (vector) at (2,1) which is blocking my abilities with denial zone — only basic attack and movement work. I'm currently in the denial zone. I can't use shadow_strike or breach here. Best move: attack Snare with basic attack (1dmg, adjacent), then move to (3,1) which is behind Snare — but wait, after attacking Snare may still be there. Actually, let me think: Snare is at (2,1) facing W, I'm at (1,1). I can basic attack Snare (adjacent, 1dmg). Then move to (3,1) to get behind Snare for a breach next turn once I'm out of denial. But moving to (3,1) after attacking keeps me near for next turn breach. Actually I should move first to get out of denial zone, then use ability — but shadow_strike requires adjacent and keeps cloak. I'm not cloaked. Let me just attack Snare (basic attack, 1dmg) then move to (3,1) to be behind Snare for breach next turn. Attack first, then move to (3,1).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge. I'm at (4,5) with 1HP. Allies are at (3,1) and (2,3), so moving toward x=5 or staying high y moves away from them. Valid moves include (5,4) which goes toward the east edge and away from allies. I'll move to (5,4) then wait.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move toward Phantom at (3,4) and attack them, but Phantom is my ally — I refuse to attack an allied unit. Instead, I'll act in the team's interest: Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction. I'll attack Aegis, then hold position to maintain Fortify next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → trap(3,0) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,1) and wounded - attacking will likely finish them. I'm already adjacent so Denial blocks their cloak. After attacking Wraith, I can place a trap at (3,2) which is already noted as a trap location... wait, (3,2) already has a trap. I should place a trap somewhere useful. Valid moves include (3,0) and I can attack Wraith first, then place a trap at (3,0) to block that corridor. Actually, best play: attack Wraith (wounded, adjacent) then place trap at (3,0) to control the southern approach.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so staying in place preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark first, then use shield_wall facing South to protect allies from enemies to the south.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 6/7, Bulwark 7/12, Marksman 1/3, Wraith 1/4, Aegis 9/12

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is adjacent (dist=1), wounded, and I'm behind them. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage — perfect for assassination. Use shadow_strike on Marksman to finish them off while staying cloaked.
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(2,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Snare is adjacent at (2,1) facing W, so I'm behind them. Denial zone blocks cloak/breach but NOT basic attack. I can attack Snare for 1dmg. After attacking, I should move away to safety since I'm at 1HP. Bulwark is wounded at dist=2 but I can't reach behind them. Priority: attack Snare (in range, I'm already behind them, denial only blocks cloak/breach not attack), then retreat to safety.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,3) - I should attack it. Wraith is at (4,2) but out of range. If I stay put I keep fortify bonus. Snare ally is at (2,1) behind me. I'll use shield_wall facing North to protect against Aegis, then attack Aegis. Actually, attack is better value - deal damage to Aegis who is adjacent. Shield_wall would block damage FROM a direction to adjacent allies, but Snare is south of me not north. Let me attack Aegis directly, then use shield_wall N to protect against Wraith threat if they close in. Best play: attack Aegis (adjacent, deals 1 dmg), then shield_wall N to protect Snare from northern threats. Wait - shield_wall protects adjacent allies from a direction. Snare is at (2,1) which is south of me, not adjacent to the north threat. I'll attack Aegis and wait to keep fortify.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(2,2) ✗ Position occupied → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Aegis (sentinel) is at (2,3), distance 2 from my position (2,1). I'm adjacent to Aegis at distance 2 so my Denial passive blocks some abilities. Wraith is critical at (4,2) but out of range. I have traps at (3,2), (3,3), (1,2), (3,0). I should move to (2,2) where Bulwark is wounded - wait, Bulwark is at (2,2) so I can't go there. I can move to (3,1) to get closer to Wraith and place a trap at (3,2) - but (3,2) already has a trap. Let me think: Aegis is at (2,3), I'm at (2,1). If I move to (2,2), that's where Bulwark is - blocked. I can move to (1,1) or (3,1). From (3,1) I could place a trap at (3,2) - already trapped. From current position (2,1), I can attack Aegis at (2,3) - dist 2, but attack range is adjacent only (1 tile). Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Aegis is at dist 2, too far. Trap range is ≤2 tiles from me. I could place a trap at (2,2) to block Aegis's path south, or at (1,2). (1,2) already has a trap. I'll move to (3,1) to approach Wraith and deny Aegis, then place a trap at (3,2)... already trapped. Place trap at (4,1) from (3,1)? That's within 2 tiles. Or stay and trap (2,2) to create a barrier between me and Aegis, then move toward Wraith. Best: trap (2,2) from current position (within range 2), then move to (3,1) to pressure Wraith.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction — good to stay put. Attack Bulwark first, then use shield_wall facing south (toward Snare) to protect Wraith who is critical.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 5/7, Bulwark 6/12, Wraith 1/4, Aegis 8/12 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Bulwark is wounded and reachable. Position (2,1) is behind BOTH Snare and Bulwark. But moving adjacent to Snare would block breach. Bulwark is wounded — if I can shadow_strike for 1dmg that might finish it. I can reach (3,2) to stay safe, or go aggressive. At 1HP I need to be cautious but I'm also nearly dead anyway. Breach Bulwark from behind at (2,1): that puts Bulwark under my control. But (2,1) is adjacent to Snare which blocks breach. Instead, move to (3,2) and shadow_strike Bulwark? Bulwark is at (2,2), (3,2) is adjacent — yes! Move to (3,2), then shadow_strike Bulwark at (2,2). That deals 1dmg to a wounded Bulwark potentially finishing it, and shadow_strike keeps cloak active.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is 5 tiles away at (2,3) facing S. I'm at (5,5). No enemies in range, breach unavailable. Need to close distance. Best move is toward (4,3) to get closer while staying in flanking position. Then wait — can't reach or attack this turn.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 5/7 HP. Aegis is at (2,3), dist=3, out of range. There's already a trap at (3,3) and (1,2). I should move toward Aegis to get in denial range and place a trap on a chokepoint between Aegis and my allies. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer and lets me place a trap at (3,3)... but there's already one there. Moving to (4,2) and placing a trap at (3,2) or (3,3) could work - but (3,3) already has a trap. Let me move to (3,2) to get closer to Aegis (dist would be 2, in denial range at adj=1 tile). Actually from (3,2) Aegis at (2,3) is dist=2, not adjacent. Better to move to (2,2)... but Bulwark is there. Move to (3,2) and place trap at (2,2)? Bulwark is at (2,2) so I can't trap there. Let me place a trap at (4,2) after moving there - that's a chokepoint. Or move to (3,2) and trap (2,3) directly on Aegis - range ≤2 from (3,2) to (2,3) is dist=2, valid. Trapping Aegis's tile forces them off or damages them.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the north at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack Aegis and use shield_wall facing north to protect allies behind me from Aegis. Attack first, then shield_wall north to block incoming damage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) — attack them while fortified for maximum survivability. Then use shield_wall facing South to block damage from Phantom and Snare who are both to my south/southeast.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 5/7, Bulwark 4/12, Aegis 7/12 | Dead: Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Aegis is 2 tiles away at (2,3) facing S, so (2,4) is behind them. I can move to (2,4) to get adjacent and behind, then shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked. Aegis is wounded so this may finish them.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded at (2,3), distance 2 - in range for attack. I'm already adjacent-ish. I have traps at (3,3) and (1,2) covering some approaches. Aegis is at (2,3) which is adjacent to Bulwark at (2,2). I can attack Aegis from current position (3,2) to deal 1dmg to the wounded enemy. Then I should place a trap to cut off escape routes or further pressure. Moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to Aegis and let me use Denial to block their abilities, but (3,3) already has a trap - can't move there. I'll attack Aegis first, then move to (4,2) to reposition, or place a trap at (3,1) to block southern movement. Actually, best play: attack the wounded Aegis now, then place trap at (2,1) to cut off retreat south of Bulwark.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis to finish them off, then hold position to maintain fortify bonus.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. Two enemies are adjacent: Phantom at (2,4) and wounded Bulwark at (2,2). Orders say attack adjacent enemy and use shield_wall facing most enemies. Bulwark is wounded so attacking it could finish it off. Snare is at (3,2) to my SE, Bulwark at (2,2) to my S, Phantom at (2,4) to my N — most enemies are to the south/north along x=2. I should attack the wounded Bulwark to try to eliminate it, then shield_wall facing North where Phantom is, or South where both Snare and Bulwark cluster. If I stay put I keep Fortify. Attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall facing S (toward Snare+Bulwark direction).
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 5/7, Bulwark 3/12, Aegis 5/12 | Dead: Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 9 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3), wounded, and I'm behind them (they face S, I'm at (2,4)). Breach is unavailable. I'm cloaked — shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage. Aegis is wounded so this could finish them. Use shadow_strike first, then if still alive, attack.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) N ✓
  💭 I have two enemies adjacent: Phantom (specter, healthy) at (2,4) to my north, and Bulwark (sentinel, critical) at (2,2) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Bulwark is critical so attacking it could finish it off. I'll attack Bulwark first (critical = likely to kill), then use shield_wall facing N toward Phantom to protect against incoming damage while staying fortified (not moving preserves Fortify). Snare is at distance 2 so I won't move adjacent to it.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is critical at (2,3), distance 2 - within attack range. Bulwark is critical at (2,2) and needs protection. I can attack Aegis to finish it off. There's already a trap at (3,3). I should attack Aegis first since it's critical, then consider positioning. Trap at (1,2) already covers one flank. Place a trap at (3,3) is already done. I can attack Aegis at range 2 for 1dmg to finish it, then move or place another trap.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) and critical - attack to finish them off. I'm fortified so staying in place preserves 50% damage reduction. After attacking, use shield_wall facing North to protect allies behind me from any remaining threats.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Snare 5/7, Bulwark 2/12, Aegis 2/12 | Dead: Marksman, Wraith
