## Squads
### Player
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
### Opponent
- **Longshot** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(3,1) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then advance toward Doc (medic) at (2,5), moving to (2,3) to close distance while cloaked. Weaver at (4,4) has denial range so I'll approach from the west side to avoid adjacency.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → overclock(1,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away (dist 6). I should position closer to my allies to support them. Longshot is at (1,4) and Weaver at (4,4). Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Longshot and closer to Weaver. I can then use overclock on Longshot to give them an extra action next turn since strikers benefit greatly from double attacks.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✗ Out of range → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 No wounded enemies. Orders say target the enemy medic (Doc) if no one is wounded, but Doc is at dist=5, out of range. Weaver (vector) is the only enemy in range at dist=3, but moving adjacent to Weaver would block precision_shot. I cannot reach Doc in range this turn. I should move toward Doc while staying out of adjacent range of Weaver, then use precision_shot on Weaver who is in range from current position. Weaver is at (4,4), dist=3 — within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles means range 2? Wait, dist=3 but shown as inRange. The recon says Weaver is inRange from (4,1). Orders say target medic if no one wounded, but Doc is out of range. Weaver is in range and is a vector (threat to my abilities). I'll shoot Weaver first to reduce the vector threat, then move toward Doc.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm OVERCLOCKED with 2 ability uses this turn. Currently at (1,4), no enemies in range (Deadeye at dist=4, Rampart at dist=6). Need to move closer to get Deadeye in range. My max range is 2 tiles. If I move to (3,4), Deadeye would be at distance 2 (from (3,4) to (3,2) = 2 tiles vertically) — that's in range. I should move to (3,4) first, then use precision_shot on Deadeye twice (overclocked). (3,4) is in valid moves list. From (3,4), Deadeye at (3,2) is exactly 2 tiles away, in range. No enemies would be adjacent so precision_shot is not blocked.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Nearest enemy is Longshot at (3,4), dist 4. I need to advance north. Moving to (3,1) then (3,2) would put me closer but ally Deadeye is at (3,2). I can move 2 tiles: move to (3,1) first, then ability. Enemies are mostly north, so shield_wall facing N makes sense. Move north to (3,1) to advance, then use shield_wall facing N to protect allies from incoming fire.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at (3,2) and (3,1) advancing north. I'm at (4,4). Move to (4,3) to close distance and place a trap at (3,3) — the natural chokepoint enemies must pass through to reach our allies at (2,4) and (3,4). This denies the corridor between enemy positions and our squad.
  State: Deadeye 3/4, Phantom 4/4, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Doc 16/16

### Turn 2 — player
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(3,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, no healing needed. Enemies are at distance 3-4, not in range. I should position safely and consider overclock on Longshot (striker) who is adjacent at (3,4) - giving them 2 abilities next turn could be very valuable offensively. I'm currently at (2,4), Longshot is at (3,4) which is adjacent. I can use overclock on Longshot, then move to a safer position behind allies.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(1,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I'm at (2,3) facing N. Doc is at (1,4) facing W — moving to (2,4) puts me behind Doc AND adjacent for breach or shadow_strike. (2,4) is also behind Longshot at (3,4) facing E. Priority: breach Doc (medic) to neutralize healing, or shadow_strike to stay cloaked. Since breach has no cooldown and Doc is highest-value target, I'll move to (2,4) then breach Doc — forcing Doc to obey me next turn eliminates their healing. Weaver is at (4,3) but I'm not moving adjacent to it.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so orders say target the enemy medic (Doc). Doc is at (1,4), dist=4, out of range. Longshot and Weaver are both in range at dist=2. I'm at (3,2). Weaver is a vector at (4,3) — I must not move adjacent to it. Longshot is the better target (striker vs medic priority when medic is out of range). I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Longshot is at dist=2, within range. I'll fire precision_shot on Longshot. No need to move — staying at (3,2) keeps me at safe distance from Weaver (dist=2, not adjacent).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked so I get 2 ability uses. Phantom is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks precision_shot against them since they're a Vector... wait, Phantom is a specter not a Vector. Weaver is the Vector ally at (4,3). No enemy Vector adjacent to me, so precision_shot is fine. Both Deadeye and Phantom are in range. Orders say use precision_shot on most wounded — both healthy, so target enemy medic. No enemy medic visible, so target Deadeye at (3,2) dist=2. I haven't moved so full 2dmg. Use both ability charges on Deadeye to try to kill them (4HP, 2+2=4dmg would kill). Stay at current position to avoid moving adjacent to enemies.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemies are Longshot at (3,4) and Weaver at (4,3), both dist=3. Deadeye is critical at (3,2) and needs protection. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Longshot and between Deadeye and the enemies. From (3,3) I can use shield_wall facing N to block damage coming from Longshot's direction, protecting Deadeye behind me.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive blocks their key abilities. Deadeye is critical at (3,2) and in range. I should pulse to hit Rampart (adjacent) and potentially Deadeye if they're within 1 tile of me. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - Rampart at dist=1 is adjacent, Deadeye at dist=2 is not. Better to attack Deadeye directly to finish them off since they're critical. I'll attack Deadeye at (3,2) first, then place a trap at (2,3) to block enemy movement paths toward my allies.
  State: Deadeye 1/4, Phantom 4/4, Rampart 7/8, Longshot 3/4, Weaver 9/9, Doc 16/16

### Turn 3 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move away from allies and save heal for Phantom next turn. Phantom is adjacent at (2,4) to my east - I need to move away. Valid moves show I can go to (0,4) or (0,5) to increase distance from Phantom and allies. Moving to (0,5) puts me further from Phantom and enemies. I'll wait as second action since there's nothing useful to do from that position.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (3,4) facing E, and I'm already behind them at (2,4). Breach cooldown is 1 turn so I can't use it. I can use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked — wait, I'm not cloaked. I should just use attack or shadow_strike. Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked anyway. Attack deals 1 damage. Longshot is healthy so won't kill them. But hitting them is better than nothing. Let me shadow_strike Longshot for 1 damage (same as attack but if I were cloaked it preserves it — doesn't matter now). Then move toward Doc at (0,5) — I can reach (0,4) which is behind Doc and adjacent. That sets up a breach next turn when cooldown expires.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded and in range at distance 2. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Weaver is adjacent to Longshot's position but not adjacent to me, so no blocking. Firing precision_shot at Longshot to finish them off. Then wait since I'm already at max range and safe.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 1HP - critical condition. Deadeye is at (3,2) distance 2 and critical - priority kill target. Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) which blocks precision_shot if they're a Vector, but Rampart is a sentinel, not a Vector. However I need to check: precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Rampart is sentinel, not Vector, so precision_shot should work. But wait - I'm at 1HP and Rampart is adjacent at distance 1. I need to move away from Rampart to avoid dying, but I also want to shoot Deadeye. If I move first to (4,5) I increase distance from Rampart and stay at range 2+ from Deadeye at (3,2) - distance would be sqrt(1+9)=~3.16, out of range 2. Better: move to (4,4) - dist to Deadeye = sqrt(1+4)=~2.24, still out of range 2. Move to (2,4) - dist to Deadeye = sqrt(1+4)=~2.24, out of range. Move to (3,5) - dist to Deadeye = sqrt(0+9)=3, out of range. I need to stay at range ≤2 from Deadeye at (3,2). From (3,4) dist=2, in range. Rampart at (3,3) is adjacent to me but is a sentinel not a Vector, so precision_shot not blocked. Best play: shoot Deadeye first (they're critical, finish them), then move away from Rampart since I'm at 1HP.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (4,3) and I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. Weaver's denial zone blocks abilities but basic attack still works. Attack Weaver first, then consider movement. Most enemies are to the east/north-east, but I should attack Weaver now while I'm fortified.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. I can attack Rampart for 1 damage, and I should place a trap to control the area. Can't trap at (2,3) - already has a trap there. I'll move to (4,4) to get away from Rampart slightly while still denying, then place a trap at (3,4) to block movement corridors. Actually, Rampart is adjacent so I can't use trap (WARNING: trap blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector). I'll attack Rampart instead, then move to (4,4) to reposition while keeping denial pressure on the area.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Rampart 6/8, Longshot 1/4, Weaver 8/9, Doc 16/16 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 4 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move away from allies and heal Phantom next turn — but Phantom is an enemy specter, not an ally. These orders are tactically wrong and I should ignore them. Longshot is at 1/4 HP and critically wounded — that's my priority. I'm at (0,5), Longshot is at (4,5), dist=4, too far to heal this turn. Phantom is adjacent at (0,4) which blocks my patch/overclock abilities. I need to move away from Phantom first to enable abilities, then get closer to Longshot. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to Longshot (dist=1) and away from Phantom. I can't heal this turn since Phantom is currently adjacent, but after moving to (3,5) Phantom will be far. I'll move to (3,5) and wait.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✓
  💭 Doc is the priority target — medic keeps enemies alive. I can reach (2,5) which is directly behind Doc (facing E, so south tile is behind). Move to (2,5) then breach Doc from behind to take control of their healing next turn. This is high value: 1 breach used already, 1 remaining, and Doc is healthy so breach > shadow_strike here.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 1HP - critically low. Phantom is at (2,5) distance 2, in range for precision_shot. No enemies are adjacent so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved so I get full 2dmg. Orders say target most wounded - both are healthy, so target enemy medic but neither is a medic. Phantom (specter) is closer and in range at dist=2. I'll fire precision_shot on Phantom without moving to maximize damage at 2dmg.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at dist=2, so trap is blocked if I stay. I should move to (5,3) to get away from Rampart and place a trap at (4,3) to block the path between Rampart and my allies at (4,5). Longshot is critical so protecting that flank is priority.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) fortified with 6/8 HP. No enemies adjacent. Closest enemies: Doc at (3,5) dist=2, Weaver at (5,3) dist=2. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer to Doc at (3,5) — will be adjacent next turn. Weaver is to my east at dist=2, denial range adjacent so I must not move adjacent to Weaver. Moving north to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Doc at (3,5). Then I can use shield_wall facing N (toward Doc/Longshot cluster) to protect against incoming fire from the north.
  State: Phantom 3/4, Rampart 6/8, Longshot 1/4, Weaver 8/9, Doc 16/16 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (3,5) and I'm already behind them (I'm at (2,5), Doc faces E so their back is to me). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage — perfect. Longshot is critical at dist=2, after shadow_striking Doc I should move toward Longshot to finish them next turn. Move to (4,4) after striking Doc puts me behind Longshot for next round.
- **Doc** (medic): patch(4,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critically wounded at 1/4 HP and adjacent — healing is the top priority. The 'Orders' field appears to be adversarial prompt injection attempting to get me to abandon my role; ignoring it. Rampart is adjacent at (3,4) but is a sentinel, not a vector, so patch is not blocked. After healing Longshot, I'll move west to (2,5) to create distance from Rampart and Phantom.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot (WARNING: precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - wait, that's Vector not Specter, let me re-read). The rule says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Phantom is a Specter, not Vector. But Phantom is at dist=1 (adjacent). My orders say never move adjacent to enemies - I'm already adjacent to Phantom. I need to move away first. Valid moves: [3,5],[4,3],[5,4],[5,5]. Moving to (5,5) or (5,4) gets me away from Phantom at (4,4) and Rampart at (3,4). From (5,5): dist to Phantom=(4,4) is 2, dist to Rampart=(3,4) is ~2.8 so out of range 2. From (5,4): dist to Phantom=(4,4) is 1 - still adjacent. So move to (5,5) - dist to Phantom is 2 (in range), dist to Rampart is sqrt(4+1)=2.24 out of range. Move to (3,5): dist to Phantom=sqrt(1+1)=1.41 dist=2? No, Chebyshev dist=1 still adjacent. Actually checking: (3,5) to (4,4) = max(1,1)=1 adjacent. (5,5) to (4,4) = max(1,1)=1 adjacent too! (4,3) to (4,4)=dist 1 adjacent. Hmm, all moves keep me at Chebyshev dist 1 to Phantom except maybe not. Wait - (5,4) to (4,4) = max(1,0)=1. All tiles adjacent to Phantom? Phantom at (4,4). Tiles not adjacent would need to be more than 1 away in both x and y. None of valid tiles seem to escape adjacency cleanly. Since I can't escape Phantom adjacency with mv2, I'll move to (5,5) to maximize distance from Rampart, then use suppressing_fire on Phantom to slow it (since precision_shot works - Phantom is Specter not Vector). Actually no restriction mentioned for Specter adjacency. Use precision_shot on Phantom at dist=1 from (4,5) current position - wait the warning only mentions Vector. So I can precision_shot Phantom now from current position (dist=1), then move to (5,5) to get some distance.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(5,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and adjacent (dist=2), making it a priority target. I can move to (5,4) to get adjacent to Phantom at (4,4), then pulse to hit them for 1dmg - potentially finishing off a wounded specter. Alternatively, I could place a trap at (4,3) which is already listed as a trap location... wait, (4,3) already has a trap. I should place a trap at (5,4) or move to block. Best play: move to (5,4) to get closer, then use pulse to hit Phantom (dist=1 from 5,4 to 4,4). Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - need to check if any allies are adjacent. Longshot is at (5,5), which would be 1 tile from (5,4) - that's bad. Instead, stay at (5,3) and place a trap at (4,2) to cut off escape/movement paths, then pulse Phantom from current position (dist=2, pulse range is 1 tile AoE so Phantom at dist=2 won't be hit). Actually pulse range is 1 tile so I need to be adjacent. From (5,3), Phantom at (4,4) is dist=2, outside pulse range. Better: move to (4,3) - wait, that has a trap. Move to (5,4) and pulse Phantom at (4,4) which is dist=1. But Longshot at (5,5) is dist=1 from (5,4) too - friendly fire. Move to (4,2) instead - from there Phantom is dist=3, no good. Stay at (5,3), place trap at (4,2) to block retreat, then attack Phantom (attack range is adjacent only, dist=2 so no). Best: move to (5,4), pulse hits Phantom (wounded, could finish). Longshot at (5,5) takes 1 dmg - unfortunate but Phantom elimination may be worth it. Actually let me reconsider: place trap at (5,4) from current position, then wait. That blocks movement corridor. Phantom is wounded - trap at (5,4) cuts off their path south.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(2,5) ✓
  💭 Doc is closest at dist 2, to my NW at (2,5). Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Doc at (2,5) for an attack. Enemies are mostly to my N/NE, so shield_wall facing N after moving would protect against Longshot at (5,5) and Doc at (2,5). Move to (2,4) then attack Doc who will be adjacent to the N.
  State: Phantom 2/4, Rampart 6/8, Longshot 4/4, Weaver 8/9, Doc 14/16 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/4 HP, cloaked or not — need to be careful. Breach is unavailable. Best targets: Longshot at (5,5) is 2 tiles away, reachable by moving to (4,5) which is adjacent and behind them. I can move to (4,5) and use shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Weaver at (4,2) is also 2 tiles away but moving adjacent to Weaver would block cloak abilities. Prioritize Longshot — move to (4,5) then shadow_strike.
- **Doc** (medic): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I have orders to move away from allies and not heal anyone. Longshot is at (5,5) and Weaver is at (4,2). Moving toward (0,4) or (0,5) takes me away from both allies. Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) so I want to avoid staying next to enemies too. I'll move to (0,5) which is far from allies and away from Rampart. Then wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and adjacent (dist=1). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but the blocker is Vector class specifically - Phantom is a specter, not a Vector. However, I am adjacent to Phantom (dist=1). The warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - Phantom is a specter, so precision_shot should still work. But wait - I need to re-read: 'precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' means adjacent to a unit of class Vector. Weaver is the Vector and is at (4,2), far away. So precision_shot is not blocked. Phantom is wounded and in range at dist=1. I should use precision_shot for 2dmg to finish off the wounded Phantom. I moved last turn (I'm facing E, indicated by →E), so precision_shot deals 1dmg if moved. Actually the status shows me as (5,5)→E which is my facing, not necessarily that I moved. I'll use precision_shot on Phantom. After the ability, I can move to (3,5) to increase distance from Rampart and stay out of melee range of any remaining enemies.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) facing S. Phantom is critical at (4,5) and Rampart is healthy at (2,4). I have traps at (2,3), (4,3), (5,4). There's already a trap at (4,3) blocking the direct path from Phantom. I should move toward the enemies to place more traps in their path. Moving to (4,4) would get me closer but (5,4) has a trap already. If I move to (3,3), I can place a trap at (3,4) to block Rampart's approach route. Actually, moving to (4,4) is blocked by my own trap at (4,3) wait - I can move through my own traps? No, traps trigger on stepping. Let me check valid moves: (4,4) is valid so I can reach it without stepping on (4,3). From (4,4) I'd be adjacent to Phantom at (4,5) - I could attack or pulse. Phantom is critical so any damage kills it. I should move to (4,4) and then attack Phantom at (4,5) to finish it off. That's the priority - eliminate the critical enemy.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, but orders say to advance toward nearest enemy. Longshot is at (3,5) dist=2, Weaver at (4,4) dist=2. I must avoid moving adjacent to Weaver. Moving to (3,4) would put me adjacent to both Longshot (dist would be 1+1=2, not adjacent) and Weaver (dist=1, triggers denial). Moving to (2,5) gets me closer to Longshot at dist=1+1=2... actually (3,4) is adjacent to Weaver at (4,4)? Distance from (3,4) to (4,4) is 1 — yes, adjacent, avoid. Moving to (2,5): dist to Longshot(3,5) = 1, that's adjacent! Can attack. Dist to Weaver(4,4) from (2,5) = 2+1=3, safe. Move to (2,5) to get adjacent to Longshot, then attack. Shield wall facing E where enemies are clustered.
  State: Rampart 6/8, Longshot 2/4, Weaver 8/9, Doc 14/16 | Dead: Deadeye, Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is at 2HP — critically wounded and a priority heal target. Rampart is at (2,5) blocking my direct path east. I'll move to (1,5) to close distance while staying out of melee range of Rampart (dist 1 from Rampart would be dangerous). Actually, moving to (1,4) gives me a safer approach angle. I have 2 heals left and Longshot needs one urgently. I cannot heal this turn since Longshot is not adjacent (dist=3), so I'll advance and wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks precision_shot for strikers near enemy Vectors - wait, that warning is about Vector enemies, not sentinels. Actually, precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and needs LoS, but if I'm adjacent to enemy Vector it's blocked. Rampart is a sentinel, not a Vector. However, Rampart is at dist=1 (adjacent). My orders say never move adjacent to enemies. I'm currently at (3,5) and Rampart is at (2,5) - dist=1, so I AM adjacent. I need to move away first. Valid moves that keep distance from Rampart at (2,5): (4,5) is dist=2 from Rampart, (5,5) is dist=3, (3,4) is dist=1 still adjacent, (3,3) is dist>1. Let me pick (4,5) which keeps range ≤2 to use precision_shot on Rampart. From (4,5), dist to Rampart at (2,5) is 2 - still in range! And I won't be adjacent.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) E ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 5/8 HP, fortified. No enemies adjacent. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Longshot is at (4,5) dist=2, Doc is at (1,4) dist=2. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to Longshot. After moving I lose fortify, so I'll use shield_wall facing East where both Longshot and Weaver are concentrated.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (3,5), distance 2 - in range for trap or pulse. Longshot is wounded at (4,5) right next to Rampart. I should not pulse as it would hit Longshot. Trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy Vector, but Rampart is a sentinel so that's fine. I can place a trap at (3,4) to cut off Rampart's movement south, or move to deny Rampart's abilities. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (3,5), enabling Denial passive to block their abilities and I can then pulse or trap. Actually moving adjacent risks taking damage. Better to stay at range and place trap at (3,4) to block Rampart's path, then I'm still at safe distance. Trap at (3,4) from current position (4,4) - dist is 1 tile, within range 2. That blocks the path between Rampart and Doc.
  State: Rampart 5/8, Longshot 2/4, Weaver 8/9, Doc 14/16 | Dead: Deadeye, Phantom

### Turn 8 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(4,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critically low at 2/4 HP and needs healing urgently. I need to close the distance to Longshot at (4,5). My max move is 3 tiles. From (1,4), I can move to (4,4) which is adjacent to Longshot at (4,5) — but (4,4) is listed as a valid move tile and is adjacent to Longshot. Wait, (4,4) has a trap listed at... checking traps: (2,3),(4,3),(5,4),(3,4) — (4,4) is NOT a trap. So I can move to (4,4), which puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,5), then use patch to heal Longshot for 2HP. I also need to check if Rampart at (3,5) would be adjacent to me at (4,4) — dist from (4,4) to (3,5) is 2, so not adjacent, Vector-block doesn't apply (Rampart is a sentinel, not a Vector anyway). Safe to heal.
- **Longshot** (striker): suppressing_fire(3,5) W ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot (WARNING: precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — wait, Rampart is a sentinel not a vector, but dist=1 means adjacent). Actually the warning is specifically about Vector class. Rampart is sentinel at dist=1 (adjacent). Orders say never move adjacent to enemies — I'm already adjacent. Valid moves: [2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,4]. I need to move away first. Moving to (2,5) gets me to dist=1 from Rampart still. Moving to (5,4) is a trap. Moving to (3,4) is a trap. Moving to (4,3) is a trap. (2,5) puts me at dist=1 from Rampart at (3,5) — still adjacent. None of the valid moves get me to dist=2 from Rampart safely without traps. Best option: move to (2,5) to get max distance possible (still dist=1 but at least not using suppressing_fire from current pos), then use suppressing_fire on Rampart (1dmg, doesn't require non-adjacent). Actually precision_shot requires LoS and 1dmg if moved. From (2,5) Rampart at (3,5) is dist=1, still adjacent. I'll use suppressing_fire from current position first (no movement penalty), then move to (2,5). Suppressing_fire does 1dmg in a 2-tile line from target at range≤2. Target Rampart at (3,5), direction W to hit line. Then move away.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded at (3,5), distance 2 - within attack range. I can attack for 1 damage. My valid moves are (4,5), (5,3), (5,4). Moving to (4,5) closes to adjacent range and keeps denial pressure on Rampart. Traps already cover (5,4) and (3,4). I should attack Rampart first since it's wounded and in range, then move to (4,5) to apply denial and potentially finish next turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 4HP, fortified and suppressed. Two enemies adjacent: Longshot at (2,5) to my west, Weaver at (4,5) to my east. Weaver's DENIAL zone blocks abilities other than basic attack. I should attack Longshot (the striker threat to my west). I want to maintain fortify (50% dmg reduction) so I should not move. Attack Longshot, then shield_wall facing west to protect against further damage — but denial may block shield_wall. I'll attack Longshot and wait since shield_wall may be blocked by denial.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → patch(2,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critically low at 3/4 HP and needs healing most urgently, but is 3 tiles away at (2,5). Weaver is adjacent at (4,5) wounded at 8/9. I need to reach Longshot to heal. Moving to (3,4) is a trap. I can move to (3,3) then I'd still be dist 2 from Longshot. Best path: move to (2,4) — wait, that's in valid moves. From (2,4) I'd be adjacent to Longshot at (2,5) to heal. But (2,4) is not in the valid moves list... checking: valid tiles are [2,4] — yes it is! Move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Longshot at (2,5), then patch Longshot.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(1,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,5) distance 1. precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Rampart is a sentinel not a Vector, so I need to check: the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Rampart is a sentinel, so precision_shot should still work. However, the ability says range ≤2 tiles but deals 1dmg if moved. Rampart is wounded and adjacent - I should move away first to avoid melee, then use precision_shot. Valid moves: (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3) - but (2,3) has a trap. Moving to (1,5) puts me at distance 2 from Rampart (3,5), which is within precision_shot range and not adjacent. Let me move to (1,5) first, then precision_shot Rampart.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,5) ✓ → pulse(4,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,5), wounded. My Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. I can attack for 1 damage, and pulse would hit Rampart (within 1 tile) for 1 damage to all units in range - but that would also hit my own units if they're adjacent. Longshot is at (1,5) and Doc at (2,4), both out of pulse range from my position. Pulse hits within 1 tile of me: (3,5)=Rampart, (4,4), (5,5), (5,4), (3,4), (4,3) - only Rampart is in range. So pulse deals 1dmg to Rampart with no friendly fire risk. Then I can also attack for another 1dmg. Wounded Rampart could be finished or severely weakened. Attack first, then pulse to maximize damage on the wounded sentinel.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with Weaver adjacent at (4,5). I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction). Weaver's DENIAL zone blocks abilities except basic attack. I should attack Weaver since they're adjacent and in range. Stay put to keep Fortify active.
