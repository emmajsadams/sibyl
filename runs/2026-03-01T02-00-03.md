## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
### Opponent
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(3,5) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are 4-6 tiles away, no adjacent threats. After cloaking, advance south toward the enemy lines. Moving to (3,2) gets me 3 tiles closer to Bulwark while staying central.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → scan(4,0) ✓
  💭 Both Bulwark and Deadeye are at dist=4 which is exactly in scan range. I should move closer to ensure I can scan one of them. Moving to (4,3) brings me 1 step closer to both southern enemies. From (4,3), Deadeye at (4,0) is dist=3 and Bulwark at (3,1) is dist=3 - both in range. I'll move south then scan Deadeye (striker) since knowing their attack patterns is high value.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, perfect time to cloak. Both enemies are far (dist 5-6), so I can't reach them this turn. I'll cloak first, then move north toward the enemy lines, advancing toward Lens at (4,3) which is behind-able from (4,4). Moving to (2,3) gets me closer while staying safe under cloak.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (4,3), distance 3 which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). Wait — dist 3 means it's actually OUT of precision_shot range (range ≤2). Need to move closer. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist 1 from Lens at (4,3), within range. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Best play: move to (4,2) then precision_shot Lens.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Push forward toward the enemy. Lens is at (4,3) dist=3, closest threat. Move to (3,3) to close distance while staying near Deadeye at (4,2). No adjacent enemies to attack yet. Shield_wall not useful without adjacent allies to protect from a clear direction.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) and enemies are at distance 4-6. My orders are to hold the front line and position between allies and enemies. Ghost is at (3,2) and Lens at (4,3) — enemies Bulwark at (3,3) and Deadeye at (4,2) are close to them. I should move toward the center to protect allies. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer to the action and positions me between my allies and enemies. If I don't move further, I can use Fortify for damage reduction, but advancing is more important. I'll move to (2,4) and wait to preserve Fortify passive for next turn if needed.
  State: Bulwark 8/8, Shade 4/4, Deadeye 4/5, Rampart 8/8, Ghost 4/4, Lens 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with enemies Bulwark at (3,3) dist=1 and Deadeye at (4,2) dist=1. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Bulwark is a sentinel not a Vector, so scan should work. I need to scan Bulwark to reveal its prompt. However, I'm too close to enemies and at 5/6 HP. Deadeye just used precision_shot on me last turn (Foresight shows it targeted 4,3). I need to move away to safety first, then scan. Moving to (4,5) gets me away from both enemies while staying on the field. From (4,5) Bulwark at (3,3) is dist=3, still in scan range (≤4). So: move to (4,5), then scan Bulwark.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) facing S — I'm at (2,3) which is in front of them, not behind. Behind tile is (2,5). I can move to (2,5) to get behind Rampart, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Lens is the oracle — dangerous, but farther. Priority: use remaining cloak turn to get behind Rampart and shadow_strike.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → breach(4,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I'm currently behind Bulwark (I'm at 3,2, Bulwark faces N at 3,3 — south of them is behind). I can shadow_strike Bulwark from current position since I'm adjacent and behind, which keeps cloak. But cloak only has 1 turn left so it expires anyway. Better to use breach on Bulwark since I'm already behind them — breach requires being behind enemy and I'm at the behind tile (3,2). This would let me control Bulwark next turn. Alternatively, move to (4,1) to get behind Deadeye and breach them — Deadeye is a striker, more dangerous. Let me breach Bulwark now since I'm already in position, then I can deal with Deadeye. Actually breach on the striker Deadeye would be more valuable. Move to (4,1) first, then breach Deadeye.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. Current position (4,2). Allies at (3,3) and (2,5). Enemies at (4,1), (2,4), (4,5). Moving to (5,3) takes me to the east edge and away from the main combat cluster. Then move to (5,1) gets me further from allies and toward the south edge.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (2,5) — attack it. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Shade, then stay.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,4), dist=2. I can move to (2,3) or (3,4) to get adjacent. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (2,4) and keeps me between enemies. From (3,4) I can attack Rampart. Orders say push forward and attack when possible.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Shade 3/4, Deadeye 4/5, Rampart 6/8, Ghost 4/4, Lens 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): breach(2,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) directly behind Rampart at (2,4) facing S — I'm already on the behind tile. I can breach Rampart to take control, or shadow_strike for damage. Lens is at (4,5) and reachable behind via (4,4). Priority: Rampart is adjacent and I'm behind them — perfect breach opportunity. Breaching Rampart wastes the sentinel's turn and removes them as a threat. Save shadow_strike for later. After breach, I could move toward Lens. Actually, breach is high value here since Rampart is healthy sentinel adjacent to ally Bulwark at (3,4). Use breach on Rampart now, then move to (4,4) to get behind Lens for next turn.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,1) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is adjacent at (5,1) facing S. I can move to (5,2) to get behind Deadeye, then use shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Breach is on cooldown anyway. Moving behind first maximizes damage positioning.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent to me at (4,4) — WARNING: scan is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not a Vector, so scan should work. Shade's prompt is unknown and they're right next to me. Foresight shows Shade will move to (2,5) and shadow_strike (2,4) — that's Rampart's position! I need to warn Rampart. But first, Shade is at dist=1 (adjacent), scan would reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. However, I'm at 5/6 HP and Shade is adjacent — risky. Better to scan Shade now to get intel and deal damage, then move away to safety. I can move to (5,5) or (5,4) to get distance. Let me scan Shade first (they're in range at dist=1), then move to (5,5) to escape. Recalibrate on Rampart would be useful to warn about Shade's incoming shadow_strike, but Rampart is at (2,4) — not adjacent to me. So I'll scan Shade for intel+damage, then move to safety.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. Current position is (5,1). Allies are at (3,4) and (4,4). Valid moves include (5,0) which is the bottom-right corner edge — maximally far from allies clustered in the (3-4, 4) area. Move to (5,0) to reach the edge.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. Allies are at (5,2) and (5,5), so I should move west/south toward the edge. Currently at (2,4), moving to (1,3) gets me toward the south edge and away from allies. Then attack Bulwark at (3,4) while I still can — wait, orders say move away, not engage. I'll move to (1,3) then (0,4) isn't available but (1,4) is closer to west edge. Actually (1,4) keeps me on row 4, (0,4) is listed as valid. Moving to (0,4) puts me at the west edge, away from allies at east side.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,4) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. Enemies are Rampart at (0,4) to my west, Lens at (5,5) to my northeast, Ghost at (5,2) to my southeast. Moving would break fortify. The enemy cluster is to my east/right side (Lens+Ghost). I should shield_wall facing East to protect Shade who is wounded at (4,4) east of me. If I move, I lose fortify. Best to stay fortified and shield_wall east to protect Shade from the eastern enemies.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Shade 2/4, Deadeye 3/5, Rampart 6/8, Ghost 4/4, Lens 5/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,1) ✓ → breach(5,0) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is wounded and I'm already behind them (facing S, I'm at (5,2) which is north of them at (5,0)). I can move to (5,1) to get adjacent and behind, then use breach to take control of this wounded striker. Breach is ready and this is the most dangerous isolated target — wounded striker taken out of action for a turn is high value.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,2) ✓ → recalibrate(5,1) ✓
  💭 Both Shade and Bulwark are already scanned. Shade is wounded at (4,4) and Bulwark is healthy at (3,4). Deadeye is out of scan range at (5,0). I should consider recalibrating an ally. Ghost is healthy and nearby at (5,1) — but I can only recalibrate adjacent allies, and Ghost is not adjacent to me at (5,5). Rampart is at (0,4), also not adjacent. No recalibrate target available. All enemies are already scanned. Deadeye is out of range at dist 5. I could move closer to scan Deadeye, but that risks exposing me. Moving to (5,2) would put me at dist 3 from Deadeye at (5,0), within scan range. Ghost is at (5,1) so I'd be adjacent to Ghost after moving to (5,2), enabling recalibrate. Actually Deadeye's prompt is already known from prior scan data shown. Wait — Deadeye prompt IS known already. All three enemy prompts are known. No new scan needed. I should stay safe. Move to (5,3) to maintain position and wait, or I could recalibrate Ghost if adjacent. From (5,5) Ghost is at (5,1) — distance 4, not adjacent. If I move to (5,2), Ghost at (5,1) is adjacent (dist 1), so I can recalibrate. Ghost is a specter — could benefit from addendum about targeting wounded Shade. Let me move to (5,2) then recalibrate Ghost to coordinate on Shade.
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/4 HP with breach on cooldown. Lens is at (5,2) facing S — I can get behind at (5,3). Moving there and using shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage without breaking it. Rampart is 4 tiles away, not reachable this turn. Ghost is healthy and nearby at (5,1) — dangerous. Priority: move to (5,3) behind Lens, shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies toward edge. Ghost is adjacent at (5,1) so precision_shot is blocked. Valid moves: (4,0), (3,0), (4,1). Moving to (4,0) follows orders and creates slight distance from Ghost.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. Allies are at (5,1) and (5,2) — east side. Edge tiles to the west/south are good candidates. I'm at (0,4), already on the west edge. Moving south toward (0,2) gets me further from allies and stays on the edge. Max move is 2, so I can reach (0,2) directly.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) S ✓
  💭 Enemies are clustered to the SE (Ghost at 5,1, Lens at 5,2, Rampart at 0,2). Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'm at (3,4) fortified. Moving toward the enemy cluster — advance to (4,3) to close distance toward Ghost/Lens at (5,1-2). Then shield_wall facing S or E toward that cluster to protect allies Shade(5,3) and Deadeye(4,0). Shade is adjacent-ish at (5,3), Deadeye is further south. Shield_wall facing S would protect Deadeye's direction. Ghost and Lens are south of me after I move, so facing S makes sense.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Shade 2/4, Deadeye 3/5, Rampart 6/8, Ghost 4/4, Lens 4/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(5,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (5,3) and wounded — already scanned, prompt known. Ghost is at (5,1) moving south toward (5,0) per Foresight. I'm at (5,2) with Ghost below me and Shade above me — sandwiched. Shade will shadow_strike me this turn per Foresight. I should move away from Shade to break adjacency and avoid the strike, while staying useful. Moving to (4,2) puts me away from Shade, still in scan range of all enemies. But wait — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not Specter. Shade is a specter. All enemies are already scanned. I should recalibrate Ghost who is about to breach — Ghost is at (5,1), adjacent to me. I can recalibrate Ghost to improve their breach targeting. But first I need to escape Shade's shadow_strike. Move to (4,2) first, then recalibrate Ghost at (5,1) — distance would be 2, not adjacent. Better: recalibrate Ghost first while adjacent at (5,1), then move away from Shade. Ghost is at (5,1) which is adjacent to my position (5,2). Recalibrate requires adjacent target. So: recalibrate Ghost first, then move to (4,2) to escape Shade.
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → breach(5,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 2HP, uncloaked. Ghost is at (5,1) and Lens is at (4,2), both healthy. (5,2) is behind both Ghost and Lens. I can move to (5,2) which puts me adjacent and behind Ghost. From there I can breach Ghost — forcing them to obey me next turn, taking a dangerous specter out of action. This is the highest-value play since Ghost is a specter like me and could be deadly. Save shadow_strike as alternative but breach is better value here.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward Rampart, do not attack. Rampart is at (0,2). I need to move away from current position (5,1) toward (0,2). Valid moves available: (3,1) gets me significantly closer to Rampart at (0,2) while moving away from allies Lens at (4,2). I should not attack. Just move toward Rampart.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge. I'm already at (4,0) which is the bottom edge. Valid moves include (5,0) which moves me further from allies at (4,3) and (5,2), while staying on the edge. Ghost is at (3,1) dist=2 and in range — I could fire precision_shot first then move, or move then fire. Since orders say move away, I'll fire at Ghost first (healthy, dist=2, no movement penalty if I shoot before moving), then move to (5,0) to follow orders.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,2) S ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (4,2) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. After attacking, use shield_wall facing South to protect Shade at (5,2) from the enemy cluster direction.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. Allies are at (3,1) and (4,2), so I should move west/south toward the left or bottom edge. I'm already on the left edge (x=0). Moving south toward (0,0) takes me to the bottom-left corner, maximizing distance from allies while hugging the edge.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Shade 2/4, Deadeye 3/5, Rampart 6/8, Ghost 2/4, Lens 3/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → recalibrate(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 3HP, adjacent to Bulwark at (4,3) and Shade at (5,2). Foresight shows Bulwark will attack me this turn and Shade used breach last turn. All enemies already scanned. I need to retreat to survive. Moving west to (2,2) gets me out of melee range of both Bulwark and Shade. From (2,2) I can scan Deadeye at (5,0) — distance would be 3+0=3 tiles, within range 4. Deadeye is already scanned though. Better to recalibrate Ghost who is wounded at (3,1) — but Ghost won't be adjacent after I move to (2,2), distance would be ~1.4 tiles so not adjacent. Move to (3,2) instead — then Ghost at (3,1) is adjacent and I can recalibrate. From (3,2) Bulwark is at distance 1 (4,3)→(3,2)=dist 2, safe. Shade at (5,2) dist=2, safe. This gets me out of adjacent range. Then recalibrate Ghost to focus on Shade who is wounded and cloaking.
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 2HP, uncloaked. Lens is wounded at (3,2) facing W — I'm already behind them (4,2) is reachable and adjacent. Ghost is wounded at (3,1) facing W with (4,1) behind them, also reachable. Priority: move to (4,2) to get adjacent to Lens, then shadow_strike Lens (wounded, behind, keeps any stealth). This could finish or heavily damage Lens without breaking cloak mechanics.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Rampart, do not attack. Rampart is at (0,0), allies are Lens at (3,2). I'm at (3,1). Moving toward (1,0) gets me away from Lens and closer to Rampart's area. Then wait.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies toward the edge. Step to (4,0) which moves me toward the corner edge. No enemies in range so no ability to use.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range. Deadeye at (4,0) is closest at dist 4. Ghost is adjacent at (1,0) and wounded - I should stay close to protect allies. Moving to (2,0) advances toward enemies while keeping me between Deadeye and my allies. I'll stay fortified if I don't use my full move, but advancing is more important to close the gap. Move to (2,0) to position between Deadeye and allies, then wait to maintain fortify next turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (3,2) dist=2, closest threat. I'm at (4,3) fortified. Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Moving to (3,3) closes on Lens and puts me adjacent. Enemies are generally to the SW/W. Shield_wall facing W or S to protect allies Shade@(4,2) and Deadeye@(4,0). Shade is at (4,2) which is S of me currently - after moving to (3,3), Deadeye@(4,0) is SE and Shade@(4,2) is E. Lens@(3,2) would be S of (3,3) - adjacent, so I can attack. Let me move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Lens, then attack.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Shade 2/4, Deadeye 3/5, Rampart 6/8, Ghost 2/4, Lens 1/6

### Turn 7 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Rampart, do not attack. Rampart is at (2,0). I'm at (1,0). Moving toward Rampart means moving east along the bottom row. Deadeye is at (4,0) moving west, so I should position carefully. Moving to (3,0) gets me closer to Rampart's position area while staying mobile. I have 2HP so staying safe is priority. No attack ordered.
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (3,2), critical health, and I'm already behind them. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. One hit should finish a critical enemy. Use shadow_strike on Lens immediately, then move to better position.
- **Deadeye** (striker): attack(3,0) ✓ → precision_shot(2,0) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks precision_shot. Priority: eliminate Ghost with attack (adjacent), then use precision_shot on Rampart from range 2 (safe distance). Ghost is wounded so attack should finish or heavily damage it.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) S ✓
  💭 Both enemies are to my south. Ghost is critical at (3,0) dist 3, Rampart healthy at (2,0) dist 4. My allies Shade and Deadeye are both wounded in the south area. Orders say push forward aggressively. I should move south to close distance. Moving to (3,1) would put me adjacent to Shade and closer to enemies, but Shade is already there. Move to (2,2) closes distance on both enemies and gets me within 2 tiles of Ghost next turn. Then shield_wall facing S to protect allies from the enemy cluster to the south.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,0) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,0) with 5/8 HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Ghost is critical at (3,0) adjacent to me. Enemies: Bulwark at (2,2), Shade at (3,1), Deadeye at (4,0) - all dist=2. No enemies adjacent so can't attack. Moving would lose fortify bonus. Ghost is critical and needs protection. I should use shield_wall toward North to protect against Bulwark/Shade threats from above, then wait to maintain fortify. Actually, shield_wall needs an adjacent ally target - Ghost at (3,0) is adjacent. I'll shield_wall targeting Ghost toward N (Bulwark/Shade threat direction) and wait to keep fortify.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Shade 2/4, Deadeye 3/5, Rampart 5/8, Ghost 1/4 | Dead: Lens

### Turn 8 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(3,1) ✓ → move(1,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so I need to kill before being killed. Two wounded enemies in range: Shade at (3,1) dist=1 and Deadeye at (4,0) dist=1. Breach is unavailable. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1dmg — if Shade is wounded (likely at 1HP), shadow_strike should finish them. I'm not currently cloaked so shadow_strike may not be usable... actually shadow_strike requires adjacency and keeps cloak but doesn't require being cloaked. It does 1dmg adjacent. Deadeye is also wounded and adjacent. I should use shadow_strike on one of them to kill, then move away or shadow_strike the other if I can use it twice. Wait — I can only use one ability per turn. Best play: shadow_strike Shade (adjacent at dist=1) to potentially kill, then move to safety. Or shadow_strike Deadeye. Shade is at (3,1) which is directly north — adjacent. Deadeye at (4,0) is directly east — adjacent. Both wounded. I'll shadow_strike Shade first (they're wounded, this should kill), then move away from Deadeye toward (1,0) for safety at 1HP.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,0) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 1HP — critically wounded. No enemies in range for shadow_strike. Breach is exhausted. Ghost is critical at (1,0), Rampart is healthy at (2,0). I need to close distance to finish off Ghost. Moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent to both Ghost at (1,0) and Rampart at (2,0) — risky with 1HP. But Ghost is critical and I can shadow_strike without breaking cloak... wait, I'm not cloaked. I should move to (2,1) to get adjacent to Ghost at (1,0) and use shadow_strike to finish it off. Ghost is critical so any 1dmg should kill it. Rampart is at (2,0) adjacent to (2,1) which is dangerous but Ghost kill is worth it.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at dist=2, healthy, in range. Ghost is critical at dist=3, out of precision_shot range (range≤2). I'm at (4,0), not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. Rampart is the priority healthy target in range. I'll use precision_shot on Rampart (dist=2, within range, no move so full 2dmg). Then wait as second action.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 7/8 HP, fortified. Rampart is at (2,0) dist=2, Ghost at (1,0) dist=3. Neither is in attack range. Orders say push forward aggressively. If I move to (2,1) I'll be adjacent to Rampart at (2,0) and can attack. But Shade is at (2,1) already - can't move there. Move to (3,1) to get adjacent to Rampart at (2,0)? Dist from (3,1) to (2,0) = 2, still not adjacent. Move to (2,3) keeps distance. Best aggressive move: (3,1) gets me dist=2 from Rampart still. Try (2,1) - occupied by Shade. Valid moves include (3,1). From (3,1), Rampart at (2,0) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41, so adjacent diagonally - but adjacency is typically cardinal. From (3,1) to (2,0): dx=1,dy=1, not cardinal adjacent. I need to be at (2,1),(1,0),(3,0),(2,-1) to be adjacent to Rampart(2,0). (2,1) is occupied. (3,1) is valid move - from there I can shield_wall S direction to protect Shade at (2,1). Actually move to (3,1) and shield_wall facing S toward enemy cluster at (2,0). That protects nearby allies from southern threats.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(1,0) N ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (2,1) and critical — attack to finish. I'm already fortified with 4HP, so staying in place preserves the 50% damage reduction. Ghost is critical at (1,0) to my west; after attacking Shade I can shield_wall north to block incoming fire from Bulwark/Deadeye direction.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → attack(4,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,0) with 1HP - very fragile. Breach is exhausted (2/2 used). Both enemies are at dist=3, out of range. No behind positions reachable. Rampart is my wounded ally at (2,0). Best play: move toward Deadeye (wounded, priority target) to close the gap. Move to (3,0) gets me to dist=1 from Deadeye at (4,0), then I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked... but I'm not cloaked. At 1HP I need to be careful. Moving to (3,0) puts me adjacent to Deadeye - I can shadow_strike to finish them off. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I had it, but attack would work too. Let me move to (3,0) and use attack on Deadeye at (4,0) - wait, attack range is adjacent only. (3,0) to (4,0) is dist=1, so adjacent. I can attack Deadeye. But at 1HP I risk dying if Deadeye retaliates. However Deadeye acts after me in order, so I act first. Kill Deadeye this turn.
- **Deadeye** (striker): attack(3,0) ✓ → precision_shot(2,0) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (3,0) which blocks precision_shot. Ghost is critical - use attack to finish it. Then Rampart is wounded at dist=2, use precision_shot on them.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,0) ✓ → attack(2,0) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,0), dist 2, not in melee range. Deadeye is at (4,0) wounded and needs protection. I should move to (2,0) to close on Rampart and attack. Moving to (3,0) keeps me adjacent to Rampart at (2,0) for melee attack. Let me check: from (3,0), Rampart at (2,0) is distance sqrt(1+0)=1, adjacent. That works.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2HP with fortify active (50% damage reduction), I need to stay put to keep fortify. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,0). I can attack Bulwark while maintaining my fortified position. Moving would lose fortify and likely get me killed.
  State: Bulwark 6/8, Deadeye 2/5, Rampart 2/8 | Dead: Shade, Ghost, Lens
