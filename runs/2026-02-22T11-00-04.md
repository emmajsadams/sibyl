## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
### Opponent
- **Pulse** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(3,1) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Then advance toward enemies. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Bastion while staying cloaked. No enemies in range yet.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-7, need ≤4). I need to move closer to bring at least one into range. Moving to (4,3) gets me 3 tiles north, bringing Bastion at (3,4) to dist=2 — well within scan range. Ghost at (1,4) would be dist=4, also scannable. After moving, I'll scan Bastion to get intel on their sentinel prompt and deal 1 damage.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Both enemies are out of range. Insight at (4,3) facing N with behind tile at (4,2) is the priority target. Longshot at (2,0) is the damage dealer but far south. I'll cloak first, then move toward Insight to position for a breach next turn. Moving to (2,3) advances me toward Insight while staying off the direct path.
- **Pulse** (medic): patch(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at 9/10 HP and is adjacent to me at (3,4). I should move closer to heal — wait, Bastion is at (3,4) and I'm at (3,5), so we ARE adjacent already. I can patch Bastion immediately. No enemies are adjacent so patch is not blocked. After healing, I'll stay put to maintain support position.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Closest is Bastion at dist 5. I need to close distance to get within range 2 for precision_shot. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer to the action. Allies Veil and Insight are at (3,3) and (4,3) engaging. I should advance to threaten Pulse (medic) priority target. Move to (4,0) to reposition, then wait for next turn to engage.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Insight is 2 tiles away at (4,3) - I need to close in. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Insight's current position and between allies and enemies. Then I can use shield_wall facing South to protect Ghost at (2,3) or wait to attack if Insight moves adjacent. Actually, moving to (3,3) keeps me between Ghost and Insight while staying close. Better: move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Insight at (4,3) - but they may move. I'll move to (4,4) to threaten Insight and position between enemies and allies. If Insight is still at (4,3) after my move, I can attack.
  State: Veil 5/5, Longshot 5/5, Insight 5/6, Bastion 10/10, Pulse 11/11, Ghost 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I'm behind Bastion from tile (3,4) - I can move there and breach. Bastion is a sentinel, breach breaks defensive posture per orders. Move to (3,4) which is behind Bastion, then breach them.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → scan(3,5) ✓
  💭 Pulse is the enemy medic at dist=3, in scan range. Scanning Pulse reveals their prompt and deals 1dmg — high value intel. Bastion is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks scan per rules. I need to move away from Bastion first to unblock scan. Moving to (5,3) keeps me at range while putting Bastion at dist=2 — no longer adjacent. From (5,3), Pulse is at dist=3 still in range. Then scan Pulse.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with Veil enemy adjacent at (3,4). My allies Bastion and Ghost are both at full HP - no healing needed. The patch ability is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Veil is a specter not a Vector, so patch isn't blocked by that rule. However, all allies are full HP so no healing is warranted. I should attack Veil since it's adjacent, or move away. Orders say keep frontliner alive - Bastion is at full HP so no concern there. I can attack Veil to help the team, but I'm a medic with only 1dmg melee. Better to move to safety and position for future healing. Moving to (4,5) gets me away from Veil while staying near Bastion at (4,4) for future healing support. Then I can attack Veil if still in range, or wait.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — must use it now to get into position. Priority target is Insight (oracle = damage dealer). I can reach (4,3) which is directly behind Insight (facing E, so behind = W side). Moving there puts me adjacent and behind for breach next turn. Longshot is the damage dealer but unreachable. Insight is the next best target — breach would let me control it. Move to (4,3) behind Insight, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while maintaining cloak.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost (specter) is at dist 3, in range for precision_shot. Orders say medics first, but Pulse is out of range at dist 5. Ghost is the closest threat and in range. I should use precision_shot on Ghost without moving first to avoid the 1dmg penalty. My current position (4,0) has Ghost at (4,3) dist 3 which is within range 2... wait, range is ≤2 tiles but dist=3. That means Ghost is OUT of precision_shot range (max 2). Let me reconsider. The recon says Ghost inRange:true but precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Dist 3 means not in precision_shot range. I can move closer. If I move to (4,2), Ghost would be at dist 1 — but then precision_shot is blocked if adjacent. Move to (4,1) puts Ghost at dist 2, within range, not adjacent. Or move to (5,1) for Ghost at ~dist 2-3. Best: move to (4,1) — Ghost at (4,3) is dist 2, within precision_shot range, not adjacent. But I moved so damage drops to 1. Alternatively, use suppressing_fire from current position? Suppressing_fire range ≤2 tiles... Ghost at dist 3 is also out of that range. I need to move. Move to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Ghost at (4,3) — precision_shot blocked. Move to (3,1): Ghost at (4,3) dist = |4-3|+|3-1|=1+2=3, still out. Move to (4,1): Ghost dist = |4-4|+|3-1|=0+2=2, in range, not adjacent. Fire precision_shot for 1dmg (moved penalty). Best option available.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge. My allies are at (4,5) and (4,3). Moving to (5,4) gets me toward the east edge while staying away from allies. Veil is adjacent at (3,4) — I could attack first then move, or move then lose fortify. Since orders say to expose myself, I'll move to (5,4) first. But I can still attack Veil who is adjacent before moving — attack costs no movement. Actually, orders are explicit: move away and expose. I'll attack Veil (adjacent, in range) then move to (5,4) toward the edge.
  State: Veil 4/5, Longshot 5/5, Insight 4/6, Bastion 10/10, Pulse 10/11, Ghost 4/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,5) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Priority target is Pulse (enemy medic = damage dealer support, must die). I can move to (3,5) which is directly behind Pulse, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Ghost is also nearby at (4,3) but Pulse is higher priority per orders. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent and behind Pulse for shadow_strike.
- **Ghost** (specter): breach(5,3) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Insight (oracle) at distance 1 — I'm at (4,3) and Insight is at (5,3) facing E, so I'm directly behind them. I can breach Insight to take control of them next turn, or shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Priority target is Longshot (striker/damage dealer) but Insight is right here. Breach on Insight is very valuable — it removes their support and lets me puppet them. I'll breach Insight first (from current position, I'm already behind them), then move toward Longshot at (4,0) to set up an assassination next turn.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → patch(4,2) ✓
  💭 Veil (enemy specter) is adjacent at (3,5) — patch and overclock are BLOCKED while adjacent to an enemy. I need to move away from Veil first to enable abilities. Ghost is wounded at (4,2) but dist=3, not adjacent. I should reposition away from Veil to unblock abilities and get closer to Ghost. Moving to (5,5) puts me at dist=2 from Veil and dist=3 from Ghost — no improvement on Ghost. Moving to (4,4) gets me to dist=2 from Ghost (still not adjacent). Moving to (4,3) gets me dist=1 from Ghost and away from Veil (dist=3). That's the best option — move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Ghost, then patch Ghost next turn. But wait, can I patch Ghost this turn if I move to (4,3)? After moving to (4,3), Ghost is at (4,2) — adjacent! And Veil would be at dist=3, so no longer blocking. So: move to (4,3), then patch Ghost at (4,2).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → scan(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 4/6 HP, surrounded by Bastion at (5,4) and Pulse at (4,3). Ghost is at (4,2) and moved to shadow_strike my position last turn. Orders say move away from allies toward the edge. I need to escape this cluster. Valid moves include (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,5). Moving to (5,5) gets me away from the enemy cluster and toward the edge. After moving, I can scan Ghost at (4,2) — dist=2, within range 4, and not adjacent to a Vector — to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Pulse (medic) at (4,3) is the priority target. I need to move away from Ghost first to enable precision_shot on Pulse. Moving to (3,1) puts me 2 tiles from Ghost (no longer adjacent) and keeps Pulse in range at dist ~2. Then fire precision_shot on Pulse.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(5,5) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge, exposing myself. I'm at (5,4) facing E. Insight is adjacent at (5,5). Valid moves include (4,5) or (5,3) or (5,2). Moving to (4,5) goes toward center/allies. Moving to (5,3) or (5,2) moves along the eastern edge away from allies at (4,3) and (4,2). I'll move to (5,3) to stay on the edge and separate from allies. Then I can attack Insight at (5,5) — wait, after moving to (5,3), Insight at (5,5) would be dist=2, out of melee range. Better to attack Insight first (currently adjacent at dist=1), then move to (5,2) to further expose myself along the edge away from allies.
  State: Veil 4/5, Longshot 5/5, Insight 3/6, Bastion 10/10, Pulse 9/11, Ghost 4/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): patch(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded at (4,2), adjacent to me at (4,3). I have 1 heal remaining and patch requires adjacency. Ghost needs healing at 4/5 HP. Move is not needed — Ghost is already adjacent. I'll patch Ghost first, then wait since no other priority actions available.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Longshot is the priority damage dealer and I'm already behind them (dist=2, behind=true). Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining), so I can't use it this turn. Best move: close to adjacent behind Longshot at (4,1), then shadow_strike for 1 damage while maintaining cloak.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✓
  💭 Pulse (medic) is the priority target — enemy damage dealer support. I can reach (4,4) which is directly behind Pulse (facing S, so north of them). From (4,4) I can breach Pulse, forcing them to obey me next turn. Move to (4,4) first, then breach Pulse from behind.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Orders: move away from allies toward edge. Currently at (5,5). Allies at (4,4) and (3,1). Edge tiles available: (5,3) or (5,4) keep me on the east edge and move away from Veil at (4,4). Moving to (5,3) gets me closer to Bastion which could be dangerous at 3HP. Moving to (5,4) keeps distance from Bastion (now dist 2) — still risky. Both Pulse and Bastion are in scan range. Pulse at (4,3) is the priority target — healing support. Scan Pulse to deal 1 damage and reveal. Move to (5,3) to satisfy 'toward edge, away from allies' — (5,x) is the east edge, moving south away from Veil.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,1), which blocks precision_shot. Orders say maintain distance and target medics first. I should move away from Ghost to get range, then use precision_shot on Pulse (medic, high priority). Moving to (2,1) puts me 2 tiles from Ghost and opens up ranged options. From (2,1), Pulse at (4,3) is distance ~2.8 - still out of range 2. Let me check (2,2): Pulse at (4,3) is dist ~2.8, still out. From (3,0): Ghost at (4,1) is dist ~1.4, still close. Best move is (2,1) to escape Ghost adjacency. From there, Ghost is at dist 2 - exactly in range 2 for precision_shot. Pulse is still out of range. Ghost is a specter (damage dealer), so valid secondary target. Move to (2,1), then precision_shot Ghost.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(5,3) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge, exposing myself. My allies are at (4,3) and (4,1). Moving to (5,0) or (5,1) goes toward the edge and away from allies. However, Insight is adjacent at (5,3) and is wounded — I could attack first then move to edge. Attacking Insight (wounded oracle) is tactically valuable before moving away. I'll attack Insight first, then move to (5,0) to reach the edge as ordered.
  State: Veil 4/5, Longshot 4/5, Insight 2/6, Bastion 10/10, Pulse 8/11, Ghost 4/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse (medic) is adjacent at (4,3) and I'm already behind them. Shadow_strike deals 1 damage while keeping cloak active — perfect for an assassin staying hidden. I'll use shadow_strike on Pulse first, then stay put or reposition. Since I'm cloaked and already in the ideal position behind Pulse, I should strike without moving.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP and Bastion attacked (5,3) last turn — I need to survive. Pulse is adjacent at (4,3) and Veil is breaching Pulse this turn, which will mess with Pulse. Ghost is moving to (4,1) and striking (3,1) — threatening Longshot. I should scan Ghost to deal 1dmg and reveal, then move away from Bastion toward edge. My orders say move away from allies toward edge. (5,5) is edge and away from allies. Scan Ghost at (4,1) first (dist 3, in range, not adjacent to Vector so scan is valid), then move to (5,5) to get to edge.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✓
  💭 Longshot is the priority target — enemy damage dealer at (2,1) facing W. I can move to (3,1) which is directly behind Longshot (behind=true, adj=true), then use breach to take control of them. This fulfills both the assassination priority and the breach usage. I'm at 3HP so finishing this threat is urgent.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. I'm at (4,3). Allies are at (5,0) and (3,1). Edge tiles available: (4,5) moves toward north edge and away from allies. I have no heals left and Veil is adjacent at (4,4), so I should avoid staying near enemies too. Moving to (4,5) gets me to the top edge area. Then I can wait or move further.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (3,1) and wounded — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Ghost is a specter not a Vector, so I need to check if precision_shot works here. Actually the warning says 'blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' specifically. Ghost is a specter, so precision_shot should work. But Ghost is only 1 tile away (adjacent), so precision_shot at range ≤2 should be valid. However, I moved last turn (shown by →W indicator meaning I faced west, unclear if I moved). Orders say move south toward Bastion. Ghost is wounded — I should shoot Ghost first to possibly eliminate it, then move south toward Bastion. Shoot Ghost at (3,1) with precision_shot (2dmg, should finish a wounded specter), then move south toward (2,0) to advance on Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,0) ✓ → intercept(3,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical at (3,1) and needs protection. Longshot at (2,0) is the closest threat at dist=3. I should advance toward Longshot to intercept and protect Ghost. Moving to (3,0) puts me adjacent to Longshot's likely path and closer to Ghost. I'll move to (3,0) and use intercept targeting Ghost to protect them from incoming fire.
  State: Veil 4/5, Longshot 4/5, Insight 2/6, Bastion 10/10, Pulse 7/11, Ghost 1/5

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse (medic, healthy) is adjacent at (4,5) and I'm already behind them at (4,4). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage. I'm already in position — no move needed. Use shadow_strike on Pulse to eliminate the enemy healer while staying cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with only 1HP — critically low. Longshot is the priority target (enemy damage dealer) at (2,0), distance 2. I'm behind Longshot (facing S, I'm at (3,1) which is behind relative to their facing). No breach available. I need to get adjacent to Longshot to use shadow_strike (keeps cloak) or attack. Moving to (3,0) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (2,0). From (3,0) I can shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked. With 1HP I must not expose myself — shadow_strike is the right choice as it preserves cloak.
- **Insight** (oracle): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, very vulnerable. Pulse is adjacent and wounded — already scanned and breached (moving toward edge, disoriented). Ghost is critical at (3,0), out of range. Foresight shows Pulse will move to (4,5) and wait — so Pulse stays adjacent. I can attack Pulse to finish off a wounded enemy, but I'm only at 2HP so I need to stay safe. Moving away risks losing the attack opportunity. Pulse is wounded and already compromised by breach. I'll attack Pulse to try to finish them, then move to (5,4) to stay at range from threats. Bastion is far (dist 7), Ghost is critical and far. Main threat is surviving — attack Pulse then retreat slightly.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. I'm at (4,5). Allies are at (2,1) and (3,0) — southwest of me. Moving east/north gets me toward the edge and away from allies. Valid moves include (5,5) which is the corner — edge of map, and away from allies to the southwest. That's the best single move toward the edge. No patch uses remain, and Veil is adjacent but I can't patch anyway. I'll move to (5,5) first, then wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): attack(3,0) ✓ → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move south toward (5,0), but Ghost is adjacent at (3,0) which blocks precision_shot anyway. Ghost is critical — I can finish it with attack (adjacent, 1dmg). Then move to (1,0) which is south/away toward open ground as ordered. Actually orders say move south toward Bastion at (5,0) — Bastion is at (2,1) adjacent to me, not (5,0). I should attack Ghost (critical, adjacent) to eliminate it, then move toward (4,0) which is southward open ground.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,1) ✓ → attack(4,0) ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (2,1) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in melee range. Longshot is closest at dist=3 to the east. I should advance toward Longshot while maintaining a defensive position between allies and enemies. Moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,0) and closer to the front line. However, moving will lose fortify bonus. Better to advance to (3,1) to close distance while staying flexible, then wait to maintain fortify next turn if needed. Actually, moving to (4,1) gets me adjacent to Longshot — I can then attack. Let me move to (4,1) and attack Longshot at (4,0).
  State: Veil 4/5, Longshot 2/5, Insight 2/6, Bastion 10/10, Pulse 5/11 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 Pulse is wounded and I'm already behind it — (4,5) is reachable and puts me adjacent behind. Shadow strike keeps cloak and deals damage to the wounded medic. Move to (4,5) then shadow_strike Pulse at (5,5).
- **Pulse** (medic): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. I'm at (5,5) which is already on the east edge. Ally Bastion is at (4,1), so moving south along the edge (toward y=0) moves away from allies. Valid moves include (5,2) and (5,3). (5,2) is furthest from Bastion at (4,1) while staying on the east edge. I have no patch uses left, so no healing. I could attack an adjacent enemy but orders say to move away. Move to (5,3) first, then (5,2) won't be reachable in one step - wait, my speed is 3 so I can reach (5,2) directly from (5,5) as it's distance 3. Move to (5,2) to stay on east edge and move away from ally.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(2,0) ✗ No enemy at target
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP — very low, need to be careful. Pulse is at (5,2), wounded and breached (moving toward edge). Foresight shows Pulse moved to (5,5) last turn and waited — so Pulse is nearby. Bastion attacked (4,0) last turn. My previous attack went to (4,5) which is Veil's position — that seems like an error in foresight reading, Insight attacked toward (4,5)? Anyway, I need to be useful. Pulse is in range at dist 2 — already scanned, prompt known. I could attack Pulse (adjacent only, dist 2 = not adjacent). Scan requires ≤4 tiles and Pulse is dist 2 — but scan does 1dmg and reveals prompt (already known). I should recalibrate an ally or scan an unknown enemy. Ghost is unknown — last seen at (2,0) after moving there and shadow_striking. Ghost is out of range. I can move closer to scan Ghost, but at 2HP that's risky. Best play: move to (5,3) to get slightly closer to action while staying safer, then scan toward where Ghost might be — but Ghost at (2,0) is far. Alternatively, recalibrate Longshot at (4,0) — Longshot is adjacent from (5,1)? No, I'm at (5,4). Distance to Longshot (4,0) is too far for recalibrate (adjacent only). I should move toward Longshot to recalibrate, or just wait safely. With 2HP, I should move to (5,5) to avoid being caught, then wait. Actually Foresight showed Pulse moved to (5,5) — so (5,5) might have Pulse now. Move to (4,4) instead to stay safe, then scan Ghost's last known area (2,0) — dist from (4,4) to (2,0) is sqrt(4+16)=~4.5, out of range. Scan Bastion from (4,4)? Dist=3, in range, but already scanned. I'll move to (3,4) and scan Ghost's area — from (3,4) to (2,0) dist = sqrt(1+16)~4.1, still out. Best: move to (3,3), dist to (2,0) = sqrt(1+9)=~3.16, in range for scan. That puts me in range to scan Ghost's last position.
- **Longshot** (striker): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,0) with 2HP, ordered to move south toward Bastion at (5,0). Bastion is adjacent at (4,1) — north of me, not south. Moving to (5,0) puts me further from Bastion laterally but follows orders. Bastion is adjacent so precision_shot is NOT an option (blocked when adjacent to enemy). I can use attack (1dmg, adjacent only) against Bastion at (4,1) before moving, or move first then attack. If I move to (5,0), Bastion at (4,1) is dist=sqrt(2)≈1.4 — not adjacent, so attack won't work. Better to attack Bastion first while adjacent, then move to (5,0) per orders.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(5,1) ✓ → attack(5,0) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,1) with 50% damage reduction. Longshot is closest at dist=2 to my SE at (5,0). Pulse is wounded at (5,2). I should move to (5,1) to get adjacent to Longshot and also position between Pulse and enemies. Moving will lose fortify but I can attack Longshot. If I move to (5,1), Longshot at (5,0) is adjacent (dist=1) and I can attack.
  State: Veil 4/5, Longshot 1/5, Insight 2/6, Bastion 9/10, Pulse 4/11 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(5,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bastion is wounded at (5,1) adjacent to me at (5,2). Longshot is critical at (5,0) dist=2, just one tile from Bastion. I can't heal, but I can overclock Bastion to let them act twice next turn — powerful since Bastion is a sentinel and can likely attack/defend more. I'm adjacent to Bastion at (5,1), so overclock is valid. After overclocking, I should reposition to stay safe while keeping Bastion covered.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,2) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — very fragile. Pulse is already breached and wounded, moving away from allies toward edge — low threat. Bastion is out of scan range. My priority is survival. I should move away from danger and scan Pulse to deal 1 more damage while I can. Pulse is at (4,2), dist 2, in scan range. Moving to (2,3) keeps me safe and maintains scan range on Pulse. After scan, Pulse takes 1dmg (already wounded, this could finish or cripple it further). No adjacent enemies so scan isn't blocked.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted (2/2). Pulse is the priority target at (4,2), dist=3, wounded. No enemies in range currently. I need to close on Pulse. Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist=1 from Pulse — adjacent, in range for shadow_strike. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage to the wounded medic.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,0) with 1HP and Bastion is adjacent at (5,1). I'm in critical danger. Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Bastion is a sentinel not Vector - however I'm at 1HP so any hit kills me. Priority: move away from Bastion first. Valid moves include (3,0) and (4,0) which increase distance. Moving to (3,0) gives dist=3 from Bastion. After moving, Pulse at (4,2) would be dist ~2 from (3,0), potentially in range. From (3,0) to Pulse at (4,2): dist = sqrt(1+4) ~2.2, so out of range 2. From (4,0) to Pulse at (4,2): dist=2, in range! I should move to (4,0) then use precision_shot on Pulse (medic, critical HP - high value target). From (4,0), Pulse is at (4,2) dist=2, within range 2. I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg, but Pulse is critical so this could finish them.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,1) ✓ → attack(4,0) ✓
  💭 Pulse is critical at (4,2) and needs protection. Longshot is critical at (4,0) dist=2, threatening Pulse. I can move to (4,1) to get adjacent to Longshot and between enemies and Pulse. With OVERCLOCKED I get 2 ability uses: attack Longshot at (4,0) to finish them off, then shield_wall toward N or W to protect Pulse from Veil.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → overclock(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with Veil adjacent at (4,3) - extremely dangerous. No patch uses left. Bastion is wounded at (4,1) but I can't heal. I need to escape Veil's reach. Moving away from Veil is priority - go to (3,1) to get distance and stay near Bastion. Then I can try to overclock Bastion to help them fight.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — critical situation. Pulse is at critical HP and already scanned. Foresight shows Insight (me) will scan (4,2) then move to (2,3) — but that's the plan from last turn. This turn I need to act. Both enemies are known. Pulse is critical and within scan range at dist 3, but already scanned. Bastion is at dist 4, out of scan range. I have no high-value scan targets left (both enemies have known prompts). I'm at 2HP so staying alive is priority. Veil is at (4,3) heading south — allied specter. I could recalibrate an ally, but I need to consider positioning. I'm at 2HP — I should stay back. Pulse is critical and at (3,1). I could move to increase distance from enemies. Best play: move further back to safety, then wait or recalibrate Veil if adjacent. Veil is at (4,3), not adjacent to me at (2,3) — dist 2, so can't recalibrate. Move to (1,3) to stay safe at range, then wait.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Pulse is critical HP and is the priority target (enemy damage dealer). I can reach (3,2) which is directly behind Pulse (facing S, so behind is north at y+1). From (3,2) I can shadow_strike Pulse since it's adjacent. Move to (3,2), then shadow_strike Pulse at (3,1) to stay cloaked.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,1) with 50% damage reduction. Veil is at (3,2) distance 2 - not adjacent so can't attack directly. Moving to (3,1) puts me adjacent to Veil at (3,2) for an attack. I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Move to (3,1), then attack Veil. With fortify I need to stay put after moving to keep reduction - but I moved so fortify drops. Still, attacking Veil is priority.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,1), healthy sentinel. Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). I'm at 3HP, cloaked. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak — ideal here. Move to (4,1) to get behind Bastion, then shadow_strike for damage while staying hidden.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 2HP — very fragile. Bastion is at (3,1), dist 4, just out of scan range. Foresight shows Bastion will move to (3,1) and attack (3,2). Veil is moving to (3,2) and shadow_striking Bastion — Veil is wounded and heading into danger. I should recalibrate Veil to warn about Bastion's counterattack, but Veil is at (4,1) — not adjacent to me. I can move closer to Veil to recalibrate. Moving to (2,2) puts me closer but Veil moves to (3,2) next turn. Actually, Foresight shows LAST turn's actions — Veil is currently at (4,1). I need to be adjacent to recalibrate. Move to (3,2) would be adjacent to (4,1) but that's 3 tiles away... let me check valid moves. (2,2) is reachable. From (2,2), Veil at (4,1) is still not adjacent (dist ~2.2). I can't reach adjacent to Veil this turn. Best play: stay safe, move away from combat. With 2HP I must survive. Move to (0,3) to stay far from Bastion, then wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,1) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. If I attack Veil without moving, I keep Fortify passive active. Attacking adjacent enemy is the priority — use ability to attack Veil, then wait to maintain fortified status.
  State: Veil 2/5, Insight 2/6, Bastion 6/10 | Dead: Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 11 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — very fragile. Bastion is 5 tiles away, out of scan range (max 4). Veil is at (4,1) wounded and just attacked Bastion. Bastion will likely attack Veil again. I already have Bastion's prompt. My priority is survival and supporting Veil. I could move closer to scan range but that risks exposure. Best move: reposition to (2,3) to get closer without overextending, then recalibrate Veil — but Veil is at (4,1), not adjacent. I can't reach adjacent to Veil in one move from (0,3) with mv3 — closest I can get is (3,3) then Veil at (4,1) is not adjacent (diagonal, dist=sqrt(2) — depends on game rules, likely not adjacent). Actually from (3,3) to (4,1) is dist=sqrt(1+4)>1, not adjacent. I should just move to a safe position and wait. Move to (1,3) to stay safe and out of threat range.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,1), wounded, and I'm already behind it (facing W, I'm to the east). I'm at 2HP so I need to finish this quickly. Breach is unavailable. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak — but I'm not currently cloaked so that's moot. Best action: use shadow_strike on Bastion to deal damage while staying stealthy if cloaked, or just attack. Since I'm not cloaked, shadow_strike still deals 1dmg adjacent. Bastion is wounded — if it's at low HP, one hit may finish it. I'll shadow_strike Bastion first, then if still alive consider repositioning.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,1) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. If I attack without moving, I keep fortify passive. Attack Veil to finish them off, then wait to maintain fortified status.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 HP is critically low at 2/6. Bastion is out of scan range (dist 4, need ≤4 but scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — not relevant here, but Bastion is exactly at dist 4 which is borderline). Veil is critical and about to attack Bastion. I already have Bastion's prompt. My priority is survival — stay safe at range. I should recalibrate Veil if adjacent, but Veil is at (4,1) and I'm at (1,3), not adjacent. No useful ability I can perform safely. I should reposition to stay safe and potentially set up a scan next turn. Moving to (2,2) keeps me at range while staying mobile. No enemies in scan range from current position. Best play: reposition slightly and wait — conserve HP.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) behind Bastion at (3,1) facing W — I'm already in the perfect backstab position. I have 1HP so I need to end this now. Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1dmg — Bastion is wounded so even 1dmg may finish it. Use shadow_strike on Bastion to eliminate or cripple it while staying cloaked.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,1) and critical - I can finish them with attack. I'm fortified (50% damage reduction) which is valuable. Attacking doesn't require moving, so I keep fortify bonus. Attack Veil to eliminate the critical threat.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 4/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 13 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — very fragile. Bastion is at (3,1), adjacent (dist 2), wounded. Bastion's prompt is already known. Veil used shadow_strike on Bastion last turn — Bastion may be nearly dead. I should stay safe and not engage melee. I can't scan Bastion (already scanned, prompt known). Best play: move away to stay safe, then wait or recalibrate an ally if useful. Moving to (1,3) increases distance from Bastion. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. I'll move away and wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 4HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Insight is at (1,3), dist=4, out of my attack range. I should advance toward Insight to close distance while maintaining front line position. Moving to (2,2) puts me closer and keeps me between allies and the enemy. Then wait to preserve fortify next turn if needed - actually moving will lose fortify. Best to stay put and wait to keep fortify active at low HP.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 4/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 14 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2HP I need to stay safe. Bastion is at distance 4, just out of scan range. I can move closer to enable a scan, but I'm wounded and Bastion could close. Foresight shows Bastion waited last turn. Moving to (2,2) puts me at distance ~2.2 from Bastion — too close. Moving to (1,2) keeps distance. Actually, let me move to (2,3) to get within 4 tiles of Bastion at (3,1): dist = sqrt(1+4) = ~2.2, well within range 4. Wait — from (2,3) to (3,1): dx=1, dy=2, Chebyshev=2, within range 4. Then scan Bastion to deal 1 dmg (they're wounded) and reveal prompt. But am I adjacent to any enemy Vector? No Vector on field. Scan should work. Low HP is risky but scanning a wounded Bastion could finish them if they're near death. Their prompt is already known though. Better to stay back and recalibrate an ally or wait safely. Actually scan is already done on Bastion. I should recalibrate an ally instead — but no allies are adjacent. Best play: move to a safer position and wait. Stay at (1,3) or move away. I'll wait in place to preserve position.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,1) with 4HP, facing west. Insight is at (1,3), dist=4, out of range. I should advance west toward the enemy to close distance while maintaining front line position. Moving to (2,1) keeps me between allies and the enemy oracle. No adjacent enemies to attack this turn.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 4/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 15 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 2HP — very low, need to stay safe. Bastion is at (2,1), dist 3, already scanned so prompt is known. Foresight shows Bastion just moved to (2,1) then waited — stationary. I can scan Bastion from current position (dist 3, within range 4) but scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — no Vector adjacent so scan is allowed, but Bastion is already scanned. Better to recalibrate an ally or just reposition safely. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. I should move to increase distance from Bastion and stay safe. Moving to (0,5) puts me far from Bastion. I'll wait as second action since no valuable ability target.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is at (0,5), distance 6 - out of range and far away. I'm fortified at (2,1) with 4HP, which gives me 50% damage reduction. Moving would break fortify. No enemies adjacent to attack. Best to hold position and maintain fortify passive for damage reduction.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 4/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 16 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → scan(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,5) with 2HP — very fragile. Bastion is at (2,1), distance 6, out of scan range (max 4). No enemies in range. Foresight shows Bastion waited last turn. My priority is survival. I should move closer to get Bastion in scan range while staying safe, but with only 2HP I must be careful. Moving to (3,5) gets me to distance 4 from (2,1): |3-2|+|5-1|=1+4=5, still out of range. Best I can do is close distance. Moving to (2,4) gives dist |2-2|+|4-1|=0+3=3 — that puts Bastion in scan range! Then I can scan Bastion (though prompt already known). Actually scanning again would deal 1 dmg to wounded Bastion. Let me move to (2,4) then scan Bastion at (2,1) — dist 3, within range 4.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,1) with 3HP, which gives me 50% damage reduction. Insight is at (2,4), dist=3, out of attack range. Moving toward Insight would break fortify. My best play is to hold position and stay fortified to maximize survivability while maintaining the front line. I'll wait to preserve fortify bonus.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 3/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 17 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is already scanned and wounded at (2,1), distance 3. I'm at 2HP so staying safe is critical. I already know Bastion's prompt. No new scan needed. I should recalibrate an ally or just wait safely. No adjacent allies for recalibrate. Bastion waited last turn, likely still holding. I'll move to (4,4) to increase distance from Bastion and stay safe, then wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with only 3HP, fortified (50% damage reduction). Insight is at (4,4), dist=5, out of range. I should maintain fortify by not moving, preserving my damage reduction as a frontline tank. Waiting is optimal to keep fortify active and hold position.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 3/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 18 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2HP I need to survive. Bastion is at dist 5, out of scan range (max 4) and out of attack range. No enemies in range. Foresight shows both enemies waited last turn. I should reposition to stay safe while keeping options open. Moving to (4,2) keeps me mobile without exposing myself.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) fortified with 3HP, facing Insight at (4,2) distance 3. I can move toward Insight to close distance while maintaining pressure. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer. But I'm at low HP and fortified gives me 50% damage reduction if I stay still. With only 3HP, staying fortified is safer. I should wait to keep fortify bonus and hold position as a front-line deterrent.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 3/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 19 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 HP is critical at 2/6. Bastion is wounded at (2,1), dist 3, already scanned. I can't scan again usefully. I should stay at range and wait — Bastion is slow (spd1) and wounded. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. Best play is to hold position or reposition safely. Moving to (5,2) increases distance from Bastion. Wait is safest to preserve my position.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with 3HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Enemy Insight is at (5,2), dist=4, out of melee range. Moving toward the enemy would break fortify and I'm low HP. Best to hold position and maintain fortify bonus. No adjacent enemies to attack. Stay put to keep damage reduction.
  State: Insight 2/6, Bastion 3/10 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Pulse, Ghost

### Turn 20 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with only 2HP — very low health. Bastion is at (2,1), distance 4, just out of scan range. I already have Bastion's prompt from a previous scan. No enemies are adjacent or in scan range from current position. I should stay safe and wait — moving closer risks getting into combat at 2HP. My orders say to stay safe at range behind the front line.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 3HP with fortify active, I should stay put to maintain 50% damage reduction. Insight is at distance 4, out of my attack range. Moving would lose fortify and expose me to more damage. Best to wait and preserve the damage reduction while holding position on the front line.
