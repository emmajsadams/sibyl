Actually dist from (4,4) to (4,2) is 2, which is in range for precision_shot but NOT adjacent, so precision_shot won't be blocked. However with 1HP I need to be careful.

If I move to (3,2), I close distance to Weaver and can attack from (3,2) if Weaver is adjacent — but Weaver is at (3,1), which IS adjacent to (3,2). However, moving will break Fortify. Better play: move to (3,3) to advance toward Weaver while staying between Weaver and Hawk, then use shield_wall facing S to protect Hawk from Weaver's direction. Wait — Weaver is at (3,1), I'd be at (3,3), Hawk at (4,4). Shield_wall protects adjacent allies from a direction. Hawk is not adjacent to (3,3). Let me move to (3,2) — Weaver at (3,1) would be adjacent, I can attack. That's aggressive and closes the gap. Moving breaks Fortify but I'm at 7HP and need to press.
