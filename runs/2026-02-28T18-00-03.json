Moving to (5,2) keeps me 1 tile from Snare diagonally (dist=2 from (4,3) to (5,2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4, but grid distance is max(1,1)=1 — still adjacent). Better to move to (3,2) or (5,1) to stay clear. Actually (5,2) is distance 1 from Snare@(4,3) — adjacent. (3,2) is distance 2 from Snare — safe. But orders say push forward aggressively. Let me check (5,2): dist to Snare@(4,3) = |5-4|+|2-3|=2 — that's 2 tiles, not adjacent! The caution says avoid moving adjacent (dist=1). So (5,2) is safe at dist=2. From (5,2) I can shield_wall N to protect allies from the northern enemy cluster. This advances me and covers allies Bolt@(5,5) and Remedy@(5,4) from threats coming from north.",
