Best: move to (5,1) - dist=1 to Hawk, then precision_shot for 1dmg. Actually wounded Hawk - need to know their remaining HP. Since wounded, likely low. 1dmg may finish them.

Actually valid moves include (4,3) but it's a trap. Move to (3,2) to break adjacency with both enemies, then precision_shot Hawk (wounded, will finish them) from range 2 — but after moving I need LoS and range check. From (3,2) to Hawk at (5,1): dist = sqrt(4+1) ≈ 2.2, beyond range 2. From (3,2) to Rampart at (4,2): dist = sqrt(1+0) = 1, adjacent, so precision_shot blocked again. Move to (5,2) instead — dist to Hawk(5,1)=1 adjacent, still blocked. Move to (3,1): dist to Rampart(4,2)=sqrt(1+1)≈1.4, not adjacent; dist to Hawk(5,1)=2, not adjacent. From (3,1) precision_shot Hawk at (5,1): dist=2, in range, not adjacent to enemy — valid! Hawk is wounded, 2dmg will finish. But I moved so only 1dmg. Still worth it.",
