The rule says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Phantom is a Specter, not Vector. But Phantom is at dist=1 (adjacent). My orders say never move adjacent to enemies - I'm already adjacent to Phantom. I need to move away first. Valid moves: [3,5],[4,3],[5,4],[5,5]. Moving to (5,5) or (5,4) gets me away from Phantom at (4,4) and Rampart at (3,4). From (5,5): dist to Phantom=(4,4) is 2, dist to Rampart=(3,4) is ~2.8 so out of range 2. From (5,4): dist to Phantom=(4,4) is 1 - still adjacent. So move to (5,5) - dist to Phantom is 2 (in range), dist to Rampart is sqrt(4+1)=2.24 out of range. Move to (3,5): dist to Phantom=sqrt(1+1)=1.41 dist=2? No, Chebyshev dist=1 still adjacent. Actually checking: (3,5) to (4,4) = max(1,1)=1 adjacent. (5,5) to (4,4) = max(1,1)=1 adjacent too! (4,3) to (4,4)=dist 1 adjacent. Hmm, all moves keep me at Chebyshev dist 1 to Phantom except maybe not. Wait - (5,4) to (4,4) = max(1,0)=1. All tiles adjacent to Phantom? Phantom at (4,4). Tiles not adjacent would need to be more than 1 away in both x and y. None of valid tiles seem to escape adjacency cleanly. Since I can't escape Phantom adjacency with mv2, I'll move to (5,5) to maximize distance from Rampart, then use suppressing_fire on Phantom to slow it (since precision_shot works - Phantom is Specter not Vector). Actually no restriction mentioned for Specter adjacency. Use precision_shot on Phantom at dist=1 from (4,5) current position - wait the warning only mentions Vector.

Alternatively, I could place a trap at (4,3) which is already listed as a trap location... wait, (4,3) already has a trap. I should place a trap at (5,4) or move to block. Best play: move to (5,4) to get closer, then use pulse to hit Phantom (dist=1 from 5,4 to 4,4). Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - need to check if any allies are adjacent. Longshot is at (5,5), which would be 1 tile from (5,4) - that's bad. Instead, stay at (5,3) and place a trap at (4,2) to cut off escape/movement paths, then pulse Phantom from current position (dist=2, pulse range is 1 tile AoE so Phantom at dist=2 won't be hit). Actually pulse range is 1 tile so I need to be adjacent. From (5,3), Phantom at (4,4) is dist=2, outside pulse range. Better: move to (4,3) - wait, that has a trap. Move to (5,4) and pulse Phantom at (4,4) which is dist=1. But Longshot at (5,5) is dist=1 from (5,4) too - friendly fire. Move to (4,2) instead - from there Phantom is dist=3, no good. Stay at (5,3), place trap at (4,2) to block retreat, then attack Phantom (attack range is adjacent only, dist=2 so no). Best: move to (5,4), pulse hits Phantom (wounded, could finish). Longshot at (5,5) takes 1 dmg - unfortunate but Phantom elimination may be worth it. Actually let me reconsider: place trap at (5,4) from current position, then wait. That blocks movement corridor.
