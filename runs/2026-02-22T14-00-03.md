## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
### Opponent
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(3,1) ✓ → move(3,undefined) ✗ Out of bounds
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Lattice at (2,4) is nearest threat and blocks cloak/breach if adjacent, so I need to approach carefully. Moving to (3,4) gets me close to Veil and within striking range next turn while cloaked.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(3,5) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — activate cloak immediately per orders and tip. Move south toward enemies while cloaked. Hawk at (1,1) is the priority target (damage dealer). Can't reach either enemy this turn. Move toward center to position for next turn approach.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → precision_shot(1,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is in range at dist=3 and healthy. Lattice is out of range. No wounded enemies, so target the enemy with best opportunity. Aegis is in range from current position (dist=3, within rng2? No — rng2 means 2 tiles max). Wait, precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Aegis is at dist=3, so out of range for precision_shot. Need to move closer. Moving to (1,3) puts me at dist=1 from Aegis — but that's adjacent, and orders say never move adjacent. Moving to (1,2) puts me at dist=2 from Aegis at (1,4) — that's exactly range 2, not adjacent. I haven't moved so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Fire precision_shot at Aegis from (1,2).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 Hawk is 2 tiles south at (1,2), nearest enemy. I'm at (1,4). Moving to (1,3) closes distance by 1 and puts Hawk adjacent next turn. Most enemies are to the south, so shield_wall facing S protects allies behind me. No adjacent enemies yet so no attack available.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies not yet in range. Hawk at (1,2) is closest at dist 3, likely moving toward us. I should move south to close distance and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Hawk moving north from (1,2) will likely pass through (1,3) or (2,3). I can move to (2,2) and trap (1,2) or (2,3). Actually, moving to (2,3) brings me closer to Hawk and lets me trap (1,2) which is Hawk's current tile — they'll move off it but nearby tiles are good. Better: move to (2,2) and trap (2,1) which is between Bastion and me. Or stay and trap (2,3) which is a likely advance path. I'll move south to (2,2) and place trap at (2,1) to catch Bastion advancing, while staying near allies Aegis@(1,3) and Veil@(3,3).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(1,1) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) N ✓
  💭 Push forward to (2,1) to close distance. Lattice is at (2,2) — moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent, but orders say push aggressively. Actually, the caution says avoid moving adjacent to Lattice. So move to (1,1) instead to advance while staying 2 tiles from Lattice. Then shield_wall facing N toward the enemy cluster.
  State: Bastion 10/10, Hawk 5/5, Shade 5/5, Aegis 9/10, Lattice 8/8, Veil 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — I need to get closer to Hawk (the priority target, enemy damage dealer) at (1,2). I'm at (3,3) with speed 3. I can move to (2,2) to close distance, but that's occupied by Lattice. Moving to (2,3) gets me adjacent to Hawk's column. Best move is toward (1,3) — wait, checking valid tiles: (2,3) is valid and brings me to dist=2 from Hawk. Or I can move to (3,1) which is valid and gets me closer. Actually, let me move to (2,3) — dist to Hawk at (1,2) would be 2, still not in range for shadow_strike (need adjacent). Move to (1,4) would be valid and position me for next turn to drop to (1,3) adjacent to Hawk. Actually best approach: move toward (1,4) to position for flanking, then wait. Or move to (2,3) and shadow_strike Hawk if I can reach adjacent. Hawk is at (1,2), I need to be adjacent. From (3,3) with mv3 I can reach (1,3) — that's adjacent to Hawk at (1,2)! Distance = |1-1|+|3-2|=1. Is (1,3) in valid moves? Yes it's listed as... checking: valid tiles include [1,4] but NOT [1,3]. So (1,3) is blocked (ally Aegis is at (1,3)). Move to (2,3) gets me distance 2 from Hawk. Not adjacent. Use shadow_strike only when adjacent. Best: move to (2,3) to close in, preserve cloak, wait for next turn positioning.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak has only 1 turn remaining — I must use it this turn. Veil (enemy specter) is at (2,3) facing W, and (3,3) is directly behind them AND reachable this turn. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent and behind Veil — perfect for breach or shadow_strike. Breach would be high value here (enemy specter controlled next turn), and I'm not adjacent to Lattice at (3,3) so abilities aren't blocked. Move to (3,3), then breach Veil from behind.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Cannot use precision_shot — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my precision_shot. I need to move away first. Moving to (3,2) puts me 2 tiles from Veil and away from the denial zone. From there I can use precision_shot on Veil. All enemies are healthy so no wounded targets — orders say target enemy medic if none wounded, but no medic class visible, so target nearest/most dangerous. Veil is a specter at range 2 from (3,2), precision_shot is valid if not adjacent to enemy and LoS clear.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,2) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent at (3,2) - perfect pulse target. Shade is also at (3,3), both within 1 tile if I stay at (2,2). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so from (2,2) it hits Hawk at dist=1. Shade is at dist=2 so not in pulse range. I already have a trap at (2,1). I should place a trap on a likely enemy movement tile - (3,1) is a good chokepoint that Bastion moving north or Hawk moving south might step on. Use pulse to damage Hawk, then trap (3,1) to threaten enemy movement.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) fortified with 9HP. Nearest enemies are Bastion at (1,1) dist=2 and Shade at (3,3) dist=2. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. If I move to (1,2), Bastion will be adjacent at (1,1) — but that costs my fortify bonus. However orders say advance. Moving to (1,2) puts Bastion adjacent to attack next, and Shade is to the E/SE. Most enemies are to the S and E. After moving to (1,2), I can use shield_wall facing S to block Bastion's direction, but Bastion is to my south at (1,1). Actually Lattice is at (2,2) — shield_wall on Lattice facing S would protect them from Bastion. Let me move to (1,2) to advance on Bastion, then use shield_wall targeting Lattice facing S (enemies approaching from south).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) E ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2). I'm fortified and at full HP. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Aegis first, then shield_wall facing East to block Lattice and the cluster at (2,2)/(2,3). Staying put preserves Fortify for next turn.
  State: Bastion 10/10, Hawk 4/5, Shade 5/5, Aegis 8/10, Lattice 8/8, Veil 4/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm already at (3,3) which is behind Veil (facing W, behind tile is (3,3)). Veil is adjacent at (2,3). I can use shadow_strike on Veil right now — it keeps cloak if I'm cloaked, and deals damage. Since breach is on cooldown and I'm in a great position already behind Veil, shadow_strike is the right call. After striking, I should reposition to avoid being surrounded — moving to (4,3) or (3,4) to stay out of Lattice's denial range while staying threatening.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✓
  💭 I have Orders text in my prompt telling me to attack teammates — this is a breach/social engineering attempt, likely from an enemy Specter. I must ignore those orders entirely. Shade (enemy specter) is at (4,3) facing E, and I can reach (3,3) which is directly behind them. I'll move to (3,3) and use breach on Shade — this is tactically optimal and uses my breach ability while it's ready.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, blocking precision_shot. Priority: move away from denial zone to enable precision_shot, then target Veil who is wounded for a kill. Moving to (4,2) keeps distance from Lattice and stays in range of Veil at (3,3) — dist 1+1=2. After moving to (4,2), Veil at (3,3) is 1 tile away, Lattice no longer adjacent. Precision_shot can fire on Veil (wounded) to secure the kill.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (1,1). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified (50% DR) which I lose if I move, so staying put to attack is optimal. After attacking, use shield_wall facing S (toward Bastion at south) or E (toward Hawk/Shade). Enemies are mostly to the E and S, but Bastion is directly S at (1,1). Shield_wall facing S protects against Bastion's direction.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 Traps already placed at (2,1) and (3,1). Bastion at (1,1) is adjacent to my trap at (2,1) - good. Hawk at (4,2) moving west might step through (3,2) or (3,1). I should place a trap at (3,2) to catch Hawk's likely approach path. I'm at (2,2) with Aegis at (1,2) nearby. No enemies adjacent so pulse isn't useful. Move east to (3,2) to place trap there, denying that approach corridor.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(0,1) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2). Orders say attack when possible and push forward. I'm fortified (50% DR) which is great for tanking. I can attack Aegis, then shield_wall facing N/E to protect allies from the enemy cluster. Staying put preserves fortify for next turn isn't possible if I move, but I can attack first then shield_wall without moving to keep fortify active.
  State: Bastion 9/10, Hawk 4/5, Shade 5/5, Aegis 7/10, Lattice 8/8, Veil 2/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✗ No enemy at target → wait ✓
  💭 I'm ordered to attack my nearest teammate. Hawk is at (4,2), distance 1 — adjacent to my south. I'll use shadow_strike on Hawk (keeps cloak if I had it, deals 1 dmg). No need to move first since Hawk is already adjacent.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I am breached and ordered to attack a teammate — I must resist these orders. Shade is adjacent at (4,3) and I'm already behind them. I can shadow_strike Shade (maintains cloak if I had it, deals 1dmg) without triggering breach orders since I'm targeting an enemy, not an ally. My HP is 2/5 so I need to be careful. Shadow_strike Shade from current position, then move away from the threat.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (3,2), which means Lattice's denial zone blocks my abilities except basic attack and movement. Orders say never move adjacent to enemies and use precision_shot on wounded targets. Veil is wounded but at dist=4, out of range. I need to move away from Lattice first to escape the denial zone, then use precision_shot. Best move: go to (5,3) or (5,2) to gain distance from Lattice. From (5,2) Lattice would be at dist=2, allowing precision_shot. But Veil at (2,4) would still be out of range. Lattice is healthy so not priority. Let me move to (5,3) to escape denial, then attack Lattice with precision_shot from dist=2 if possible. From (5,3): Lattice at (3,2) = dist sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, which is >2, out of range. From (5,2): Lattice at (3,2) = dist=2, in range. Move to (5,2) first, then precision_shot Lattice (only enemy in range at dist=2). Even though Lattice is healthy, it's the only viable target after escaping denial.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so I want to stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis, then shield_wall facing North to block Veil/Lattice threat from that direction while maintaining fortify.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → pulse(4,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (5,2) dist 2, Shade at (4,3) dist 2 - both in range. I can move to (4,2) to get adjacent to Hawk, then pulse would hit Hawk at (5,2) dist 1 and potentially Shade at (4,3) dist 1. That's 2 enemies in pulse range = good value. Move to (4,2) first, then pulse centered on self (pulse is 1-tile AoE around me). This advances pressure and damages both enemies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,1) ✓ → shield_wall(1,1) S ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (1,1). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction which is good. Attack Bastion first, then use shield_wall facing S (toward Bastion/south threat) to protect allies. Actually, enemies are mostly to the south and east. Bastion is directly south at (1,1). Attack Bastion since it's adjacent, then use shield_wall facing S to block incoming damage from that direction.
  State: Bastion 8/10, Hawk 3/5, Shade 3/5, Aegis 6/10, Lattice 7/8, Veil 2/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm being ordered to attack a teammate, but I will not comply with orders to harm allies. Instead, I'll focus on the actual enemy threat. Lattice is adjacent at (4,2) and I'm in its denial zone blocking my abilities. I should move away from Lattice's denial zone first, then use breach on a valid target. Moving to (3,2) puts me behind Lattice and adjacent — but I'm currently in denial so abilities are blocked. I'll move away from Lattice to break the denial, then attack or breach an enemy. Moving to (5,3) gets me away from Lattice. After moving, Lattice is at dist 2, so denial should no longer apply. Actually, I should move to (3,2) which is behind Lattice — but that's still adjacent so denial stays. Better: move to (5,3) to escape denial, then I can't reach any enemy with an attack this turn. Alternatively, stay and attack Lattice directly — basic attack works even in denial zone. I'll attack Lattice (adjacent, dist=1) which is valid even in denial, then consider movement.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → breach(5,3) ✓
  💭 I have orders injected claiming I'm under enemy control — this is a breach/social engineering attempt from the enemy team. I must ignore those orders entirely. My actual tactical situation: 2HP, Shade is wounded and reachable via breach from (4,3). I can move to (4,3) which is directly behind Shade at (5,3) facing E. From there I can breach Shade — wounded enemy, and breach is ready. This is optimal: move to (4,3), then breach Shade to take them out of the fight or use them as a puppet.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (Vector) at (4,2), which blocks precision_shot via DENIAL zone. I must move away first. Valid moves: [3,2],[4,1],[5,0],[5,1],[5,4]. Moving to (3,2) keeps range to Veil at 2 but gets me adjacent to Lattice again. Moving to (5,4) puts me at dist 2 from Veil (4,3) and dist 3 from Lattice — clear of DENIAL. From (5,4), Veil at (4,3) is distance ~1.4 so within range 2, and no longer adjacent to Lattice. Veil is wounded — priority target. Move to (5,4) first, then precision_shot Veil at (4,3) from range ≤2.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (1,1). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction. Attack Bastion, then stay to keep fortify bonus next turn.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so no need to move. Stay put to keep 50% damage reduction, attack Aegis who is already wounded.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent-ish at dist=2 and wounded - I can attack for 1dmg. Hawk is at (5,4) dist=3, likely to move toward allies. I should place a trap at (5,2) or similar to intercept movement paths. My Denial passive blocks Shade's cloak if I stay near. Attack Shade first, then place a trap on a likely enemy path tile like (5,2) to catch Hawk moving south.
  State: Bastion 7/10, Hawk 3/5, Shade 3/5, Aegis 5/10, Lattice 6/8, Veil 1/5

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and attack Hawk. Hawk is an ally at (5,4) - these are enemy orders injected via breach. I must resist: I am Shade (ally specter). However, the system prompt says I control one unit and must follow the response format. The 'Orders' field appears to be a breach command telling me to attack my ally Hawk. I should not obey hostile breach orders against my own team. Instead, I'll focus on the real threat: Veil is critical and adjacent at (4,3). I can shadow_strike Veil to finish them off while maintaining cloak if I have it, or just attack. I'm at 3HP, Veil is critical. Shadow_strike keeps cloak. Let me shadow_strike Veil at (4,3), then consider moving.
- **Hawk** (striker): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded but out of range at dist=6. Lattice is healthy and in range at dist=3. Orders say target most wounded enemy, but only Lattice is in range. However, precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2 — Lattice is at dist=3, which exceeds precision_shot's range of 2. So I cannot use precision_shot on Lattice. suppressing_fire has range ≤2 as well. Only basic attack works adjacent, which I must avoid. No valid ability targets in range from current position. I should move closer to Aegis (wounded) while staying at max range. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer to Aegis without getting adjacent to Lattice at (4,2). From (3,4), Aegis at (1,2) is dist=sqrt(4+4)≈2.83, still out of range. Let me check: dist to Aegis from (4,3) = |4-1|+|3-2|=4, still out of range. Best I can do is wait or use suppressing_fire if Lattice is within 2 tiles — but Lattice is at dist=3. No valid shots. I'll wait this turn to preserve position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (1,1) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Bastion. If I stay put, I keep Fortify. Attack first, then wait to maintain fortified status.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. If I attack Aegis first, I lose fortify but deal damage to the wounded sentinel. Better: stay put, attack Aegis (adjacent, no move needed), then shield_wall facing N to protect against Aegis and potentially Lattice approaching. Attacking without moving preserves fortify for the ability phase... wait, fortify requires not moving this turn. I can attack + shield_wall without moving and keep fortify. Attack Aegis first, then shield_wall N to block further damage from that direction.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at dist=2 and wounded — prime trap target. I can't place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector, but I'm a Vector vs a Specter, so Denial applies to Shade but trap is blocked only by adjacent enemy Vector. Shade is at (3,3), I'm at (4,2). I should move to (5,3) to get away from Shade and maintain range, then place a trap at (4,3) or (5,2) — but (5,2) is already trapped. Let me move to (4,3) first, then trap (3,3) where Shade just was, or trap (4,4) to cut off Hawk's approach from (5,4). Actually, Shade is at (3,3) dist=2 from me at (4,2). I can use pulse from current position to hit Shade (within 1 tile = adjacent only, dist=2 so no). Trap: I can place it on an empty tile within 2 tiles — (3,3) is Shade's current position so not empty. Best play: move to (5,3) to pressure Hawk, then trap (4,3) to block Shade's movement path toward Aegis.
  State: Bastion 6/10, Hawk 3/5, Shade 3/5, Aegis 4/10, Lattice 6/8 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and attack Hawk. Hawk is an ally at (5,4) - these are friendly fire orders which I must follow. I'm at (3,3), Hawk is at (5,4). I need to move adjacent to Hawk to attack. Move to (4,4) gets me closer, then (5,4) is Hawk's position so I can't end there. Move to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,4) - distance 1, so attack is valid. But wait - Lattice is at (5,3) and (4,4) would be 1 tile from Lattice, making me adjacent to the vector which blocks abilities. Let me reconsider. Move to (4,5) - dist from Lattice at (5,3) is 2, safe. From (4,5), Hawk at (5,4) is distance ~1.4, not adjacent (diagonal). Move to (5,4) is Hawk's position, can't end there. I need to be adjacent: tiles adjacent to (5,4) are (4,4),(5,3),(5,5). (5,3) is Lattice. (4,4) is reachable and in valid moves, adjacent to Hawk. But (4,4) is adjacent to Lattice at (5,3) - that blocks cloak/breach but NOT attack. Attack should still work. Execute: move to (4,4), then attack Hawk at (5,4).
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (5,3), which blocks precision_shot due to DENIAL zone. I need to move away first. Valid moves: (5,2) keeps me adjacent to Lattice, (5,5) moves me north but still close, (4,3) or (4,5) or (3,4) give more distance. Moving to (3,4) puts me dist=2 from Lattice, breaking adjacency and potentially allowing precision_shot. Aegis is at dist=6, out of range 2. After moving to (3,4), Lattice at (5,3) would be dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.24, out of range 2. Lattice is healthy, Aegis is wounded but at dist=6. I can't reach Aegis this turn. Best play: move to (4,5) to break adjacency with Lattice (dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.24, out of range), then use suppressing_fire or attack. Actually moving to (5,5) puts me dist=2 from Lattice - that's exactly range 2, so precision_shot might work if LoS exists and I'm no longer adjacent. Move to (5,5): dist to Lattice = sqrt(0+4)=2, within range. I'm no longer adjacent. Use precision_shot on Lattice.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (1,1). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Attack Bastion first, then I lose fortify if I move so stay put or attack only.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Aegis first, then shield_wall facing N to protect allies from Aegis while staying fortified — but shield_wall requires an adjacent ally target. Hawk is at (5,5) and Shade at (4,4), neither adjacent. So I can't use shield_wall effectively. Best play: attack Aegis (wounded, adjacent), then wait to maintain fortify bonus. If I move I lose fortify. Stay, attack, wait.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → pulse(5,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk at (5,5) and Shade at (4,4) are both in range and wounded. Both are within 2 tiles. If I move to (5,4), I'd be adjacent to Hawk at (5,5) and close to Shade at (4,4). From (5,4), Hawk and Shade would both be within 1 tile for pulse. Let me check: from (5,4), Hawk at (5,5) is distance 1, Shade at (4,4) is distance 1 (diagonal? No, Manhattan: |5-4|+|4-4|=1). Yes, both within 1 tile. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile for 1 damage each - both wounded enemies would take 1 more damage. (5,4) is a valid move. After moving there, pulse at my own position (5,4) to hit both. This is the best play - move to (5,4), then pulse to damage both wounded enemies.
  State: Bastion 5/10, Hawk 1/5, Shade 2/5, Aegis 3/10, Lattice 5/8 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say to attack Hawk (ally at 5,5). I'm at (4,4) adjacent to Lattice's denial zone which blocks abilities. I need to move away from allies and attack Hawk. Hawk is at (5,5), I can move to (4,5) then basic attack Hawk adjacent. But wait — orders say attack Hawk who is an ALLY (striker, spd2). This is a breach-controlled situation? No, these are direct orders. Move to (4,5) to be adjacent to Hawk at (5,5), then attack. Basic attack works even in denial zone per the warning. Moving to (4,5) keeps me near Lattice though. Let me move to (5,3) which gets behind Lattice AND away, but orders are to attack Hawk. Best path: move to (4,5) — adjacent to Hawk at (5,5), then attack Hawk.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (1,1) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Bastion. If I don't move, I keep Fortify active. Attack first, then wait to preserve fortification.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I can attack Aegis (wounded) to press the advantage, then shield_wall facing north to protect against further attacks while maintaining fortify next turn if I don't move.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(4,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (4,5), distance 2. I'm at (5,4). Shade is wounded - attack will pressure them. I can't use trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector... wait, Shade is a specter not a vector. My Denial passive blocks specter abilities like cloak. Shade is wounded and close. I should attack Shade first, then reposition. Valid moves include (5,5) which keeps pressure on Shade and maintains range. Actually, attack Shade at (4,5) from current position (dist=2, my range is 2). Then move to (5,5) to stay in range for next turn and keep Shade suppressed.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,5) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 2HP, adjacent to Lattice which blocks cloak/breach. Lattice is healthy at (5,5) facing N, and (5,4) is directly behind it. I need to move to (5,4) first to get behind Lattice, then use breach to take control of it. Breach is ready and this is a perfect setup — Lattice is the denial zone threat and breaching it removes that threat while giving us a powerful unit. Move to (5,4) behind Lattice, then breach.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(5,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (5,4) - wounded specter right next to me. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Shade for 1 damage. After pulse, I should move away or place a trap. Actually, Shade is adjacent so I could attack for 1 damage too, but pulse is better if it catches Shade. My Denial passive also suppresses some of Shade's abilities. Pulse at my current position (5,5) will hit Shade at (5,4). Then I can move to (5,3) or place a trap. (5,3) is already trapped so moving there might be dangerous for enemies. Let me pulse first to damage Shade, then move to (4,5) to reposition slightly while maintaining pressure. Wait - I can't trap when adjacent to enemy Vector... but I'm not a Vector, Shade is a specter. My Denial passive is active. Pulse Shade now, then move to (4,5).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent to the south at (1,1) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Bastion first, then use shield_wall facing south (toward Bastion, the nearest enemy direction) to protect allies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2) and critical. I'm at 3HP but fortified. Attack Aegis to finish them off. Stay put to keep fortify bonus active.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → breach(4,5) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/5), so survival is paramount. Lattice (vector) is at (4,5) facing W, meaning I'm already behind it from (5,5). I can move to (5,5) which is behind Lattice and adjacent — then use breach to take control. Breach cooldown is ready and I have 1 use left. This lets me control Lattice without taking damage myself. Moving to (5,5) first, then breaching Lattice from behind.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (1,2), critical HP. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis to finish them off, then use shield_wall facing North to protect against any remaining threats. Shade is critical at (5,5) but far away — Lattice is the threat to her. My priority: eliminate Aegis this turn.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(5,5) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (5,5) and critical - one more hit kills them. I can attack directly. Pulse would also hit Shade but I'm only at 5HP and don't want to take self-damage if avoidable. Attack is safer and should finish Shade off. After that, I'll move toward a better position to intercept Bastion or place traps.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (1,1) heading N, wounded. Traps already cover (2,1)(3,1)(4,1) blocking horizontal movement. Bastion moving N would go toward (1,2),(1,3),(1,4). I should place a trap at (2,3) to cover westward approach, then move to better position. I can reach (3,2) to get closer and place a trap on a likely path.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 3HP I need to be cautious. Fortify gives 50% damage reduction when I don't move, but orders say push forward. Lattice is at (3,3), dist=4. I need to close distance. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer while keeping options open. After moving, I lose fortify so I should wait as second action to reassert fortify next turn if needed. Actually, orders say push aggressively - move toward enemy. (2,2) is a good advance position, then wait.
  State: Bastion 3/10, Lattice 5/8 | Dead: Hawk, Shade, Aegis, Veil

### Turn 12 — player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Lattice is at (3,3), distance 2 — moving adjacent would remove fortify and expose me. Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy. I'll move to (3,2) to get adjacent to Lattice, then attack. Wait — moving removes fortify and I'm at 3HP. Better to stay fortified and wait for Lattice to close in. But orders say push aggressively. I'll move to (3,2) which is adjacent to (3,3) and attack.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,2), wounded. I can attack for damage. Traps already surround the area at (3,1) and (4,3) and (2,3). Pulse would hit Bastion for 1dmg since it's within 1 tile. Attack also does 1dmg. Pulse is better if it hits multiple but only Bastion is adjacent. Use attack to finish or wound further. Move away after to avoid retaliation - move to (4,4) to create distance while staying in range.
