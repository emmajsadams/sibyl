Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Viper while staying out of Viper's denial range (adjacent only). Best move: advance toward Viper via (4,1) or (4,2). Valid moves include (4,2). If I move to (4,2) I'll be adjacent to Viper at (4,3) next turn — but Viper has denial range adjacent so that's risky. Let me move to (4,1) to approach. Wait — I have shadow_strike which keeps cloak and does 1dmg. But I'm not cloaked. I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. Moving toward the cluster: go to (4,2) this turn to position for shadow_strike on Viper next turn. Actually with 1HP any hit kills me. I should try shadow_strike on Viper if I can get adjacent. Move to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Viper at (4,3). Then I can shadow_strike. But Viper is a Vector with denial range adjacent — does that block my abilities? It says cloak/breach blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Shadow_strike should still work. Move to (4,2), then shadow_strike Viper at (4,3).",

Pulse is better if there are multiple targets but only Ghost is adjacent. Attack is same damage. I'll pulse Ghost since it's the same damage and keeps my options open. Then I could move to (5,4) to maintain denial pressure while getting slightly better positioning. Actually, staying at (5,5) keeps Ghost in denial range. Let me pulse Ghost first, then assess - or move to (5,4) first to potentially get Doc in pulse range too. From (5,4), Ghost at (4,5) is dist ~1.4 (diagonal, not adjacent), Doc at (4,4) is dist 1 - that puts Doc adjacent for pulse. But Ghost wouldn't be in pulse range.
