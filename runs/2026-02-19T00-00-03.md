## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Pulse** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
### Opponent
- **Lattice** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
