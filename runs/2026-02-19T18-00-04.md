## Squads
### Player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Snare** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
### Opponent
- **Viper** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Doc** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(1,1) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance north toward enemy lines. Hawk and Doc are at dist 4, so I need to close the gap. Moving to (1,4) gets me close to Hawk's position while staying cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5 and 6, my range is 3). I need to close distance. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer while staying cautious. Still out of range after move, so wait.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✗ Position occupied → overclock(1,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on my damage dealer if all healthy. Hawk is the striker (damage dealer) at (1,3), distance 2. I need to move adjacent to Hawk first, then overclock. Moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (1,3). Then I can overclock Hawk — Hawk takes 1 dmg but gets 2 abilities next turn, which is strong for a striker. Snare is at dist=3 from current position, moving to (1,4) keeps me safe from Snare's denial range.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, enemies are 3-6 tiles away. Hawk at (1,3) and Doc at (2,4) are closest. They'll likely advance toward our side. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer to the action and in position to threaten the approach corridor. From there I can place a trap on (2,4) or (1,3) — tiles enemies will likely move through. Moving to (2,3) first, then placing a trap on (2,4) which is directly in Doc's current position/likely path.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, enemies are distant. Snare is at (2,3) moving north toward us. I should move toward the center to cover likely enemy approach paths, then place a trap on a tile Snare is likely to pass through. Moving to (3,4) puts me in good position. Snare is moving north from (2,3) - likely paths include (2,4) or (3,3). I can reach (3,4) and place a trap at (2,4) which is directly in Snare's northward path and within my trap range of 2.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 All enemies are to the north at distance 4-5. No adjacent enemies so no attack. I should advance north to close the gap. Moving to (2,2) gets me closest to the cluster of enemies at (1,3), (2,4), (3,4). Then use shield_wall facing North to protect myself and nearby allies from the incoming enemy direction.
  State: Wraith 4/4, Snare 6/6, Bastion 11/11, Hawk 4/4, Viper 6/6, Doc 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked and already behind Hawk (Hawk faces S, I'm at (1,4) which is behind them). I can use shadow_strike to deal 2 damage while maintaining cloak. After that, I could move to (2,5) to get behind Doc for a follow-up next turn. Shadow_strike on Hawk first since I'm already in position.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare which blocks my precision_shot (denial zone). I need to move out of denial range first. Moving to (0,3) gets me away from Snare. After moving, I'll be 2 tiles from Snare and can use precision_shot on Snare (vector = denial threat, high priority). From (0,3), Snare at (2,3) is distance 2, within range 3. No adjacent enemies after move so High Ground passive gives +1 range. precision_shot is valid from (0,3).
- **Doc** (medic): move(0,4) ✓ → patch(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare (vector), so my abilities are BLOCKED by denial zone. Hawk is wounded at (0,3) with 2/4 HP, dist=3 — too far to heal this turn. I should move toward Hawk to get in range for next turn while escaping Snare's denial zone. Moving to (1,4) reduces distance to Hawk to 2, and moving again to (0,4) gets adjacent. Best move: go to (0,4) to get closer to Hawk. Then I'm still not adjacent to Hawk (Hawk is at 0,3, I'd be at 0,4 — distance 1, adjacent!). Wait, valid moves include (0,4). From (0,4), Hawk at (0,3) is distance 1 = adjacent. So I can move to (0,4) and then use patch on Hawk!
- **Viper** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (2,3), 2 tiles away — I must not move adjacent or my trap ability gets blocked. I'm at (3,4). I can place a trap on (2,4) — a tile between me and Snare that enemies may move through as they advance. Then I'll hold position to maintain area denial pressure.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) W ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Hawk is at (0,3) dist=3, Viper at (3,4) dist=3. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer to both while staying in formation with Snare at (2,3). Then shield_wall facing W where Hawk and Doc are concentrated.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (0,3) dist=2 to my west, likely to push east toward me. Viper is at (3,4) to my northeast. I should place a trap on a tile Hawk is likely to move through. If Hawk moves east from (0,3), they'd pass through (1,3) or come to (2,3) where I am. Placing a trap at (1,3) covers Hawk's likely approach path. I'm not adjacent to enemy Vector so trap is available. After trapping, I'll stay put or reposition slightly.
  State: Wraith 4/4, Snare 5/6, Bastion 10/11, Hawk 4/4, Viper 6/6, Doc 9/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires next turn — must act now. Viper is closest at dist=2 and I can reach (3,5) which is behind Viper (facing S) and adjacent. However Viper is a vector and breach is blocked adjacent to vector — but shadow_strike keeps cloak and isn't breach, so I can shadow_strike from (3,5) for 2dmg. Move to (3,5), then shadow_strike Viper at (3,4). This deals 2 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded at 4/6 HP, 3 tiles away at (3,4). I need to close distance to heal. Valid moves include (1,4) which gets me to distance 2 from Viper. Snare is at (2,3) — moving to (1,4) keeps me 2 tiles from Snare (safe, not adjacent). From (1,4) I still can't reach Viper this turn (dist=2, patch is adjacent only). Best I can do is move toward Viper and wait — next turn I can reach them. Hawk is at (0,3) full HP, no heal needed. No abilities to use this turn since Viper is out of range. Move to (1,4) to close gap.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is at dist=2 and is the immediate threat — it's within my precision_shot range (≤3) and I'm not adjacent to it, so precision_shot is not blocked. Snare's denial zone is adjacent, so I must not move closer. Bastion is at dist=3, also in range. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers — no medics visible so target damage dealers. Snare is a vector (denial/control threat) and closer, so priority target. I can shoot Snare with precision_shot from current position (dist=2, not adjacent, LoS assumed clear). No need to move — staying at (0,3) keeps me safe from Snare's adjacency denial. Fire precision_shot at Snare.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I have Wraith at dist=1 (3,5) and Bastion at dist=1 (2,4), plus Snare at dist=2 (2,3). With 2 enemies adjacent, pulse hits both Wraith and Bastion for 1dmg each — excellent value. After pulse, I should move to (4,4) or (4,5) to reposition away from the cluster while staying in range. But wait — trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector (Snare), but Snare is at dist=2 so trap is available. However, pulse hitting 2 enemies is the priority. I'm at (3,4), Wraith at (3,5) dist=1, Bastion at (2,4) dist=1 — both within 1 tile AoE of pulse. Use pulse first, then move to (4,4) to reposition and maintain pressure while avoiding getting surrounded.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) W ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (1,4). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified but I need to attack Doc. I'll attack Doc first, then use shield_wall facing W (toward Hawk at (0,3)) to protect allies from that direction.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(1,2) ✓ → attack(1,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 3HP, enemies nearby: Hawk at (0,3) dist=2, Doc at (1,4) dist=2. There's already a trap at (1,3). Viper is at range 3 so not blocking my abilities. I should place a trap to control enemy movement paths. Doc at (1,4) and Hawk at (0,3) might move through (1,3) already trapped or (2,4) where Bastion is. Good trap location would be (1,2) to catch Hawk if they push toward me, or (3,3) to block approach from east. Since Hawk is to my west at dist=2 and might advance, placing trap at (1,3) is already covered. I'll place trap at (3,3) to control eastern approach, then consider attacking Hawk or Doc. Actually, I can attack Doc at (1,4) from (2,3) since dist=2 and my range is 2. Let me place a trap first at a useful tile, then attack Doc.
  State: Wraith 3/4, Snare 3/6, Bastion 9/11, Hawk 4/4, Viper 4/6, Doc 8/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Viper is 2 tiles away at (4,4) facing E, meaning (3,4) is directly behind them and reachable. I'm cloaked (or should act offensively). Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent and behind Viper. From there I can use breach to take control of Viper — saving shadow_strike for later or using breach now since it's ready and Viper is dangerous (blocks our abilities when adjacent). Breach on Viper is high value: it removes the denial threat and turns their vector against enemies. I should move to (3,4) first, then breach Viper.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded (4/6 HP) but is 3 tiles away, unreachable for a heal this turn. Hawk is full HP, no heal needed. Bastion is adjacent and enemy. Snare is 2 tiles away so abilities aren't blocked. I can't reach Viper to heal. Best play: move toward Viper to get in heal range next turn, while avoiding moving adjacent to Snare at (2,3). Moving to (1,3) would put me adjacent to Snare - avoid. Moving to (1,5) moves away from Viper. Moving to (0,4) moves away. I should wait or move toward Viper. Valid moves don't include (2,4) which is occupied by Bastion, or (3,4). I can't reach Viper in one move (dist=3, mv=2). Best move toward Viper: (1,2) gets me closer but risky near Snare. Actually (2,5) or (1,5) keep distance from Snare. I can't heal anyone this turn. Wait and preserve position, or move to better position. Move to (1,3) is not in valid moves list. Valid: [0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,5],[2,5]. (1,3) IS valid - but that's adjacent to Snare at (2,3), which would block abilities. Avoid. Move to (2,5) to reposition toward Viper's direction without getting adjacent to Snare. Then wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is wounded at distance 2 — priority target. I'm not adjacent so precision_shot is available. Shoot Snare first to potentially eliminate or further wound them. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2 damage. After shooting, I can move to maintain distance if needed. Bastion is healthy at dist 3, lower priority than wounded Snare.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Doc is in range at (2,5), distance 2. I should not move closer to enemies. I can place a trap on a tile enemies might pass through. (1,3) and (1,2) already have traps. I could trap (3,3) or (3,2) to block paths toward allies, or attack Doc who is in range. At 1HP, attacking Doc (distance 2, need range 2) with my attack ability which only works adjacent won't work. I can use trap on a nearby tile. Let me place trap at (3,3) to cover approach routes, then wait. Actually Doc at (2,5) is 2 tiles away and within my trap range (≤2 tiles). I can place a trap at (2,4) — but Bastion is there. Or (3,4) — Wraith is there. (3,3) is empty and reachable by trap. (1,4) is empty. Let me trap (3,3) which is in front of Viper's likely path. Since I'm at 1HP, I should stay put and set a trap.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,4). Two enemies nearby (Wraith dist=1, Bastion dist=2). Pulse hits all within 1 tile — Wraith is adjacent so pulse hits them for 1 damage. After pulsing, I should reposition. Moving to (5,4) keeps me away from Snare's denial range and Bastion, while placing a trap on a likely enemy movement path like (4,3) or (3,5). Actually, pulse first since Wraith is right there, then move away to safety at (5,4).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Doc(medic) is adjacent at (2,5) to my north. Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified but should attack Doc first, then use shield_wall. Doc is north, Hawk is southwest, Viper is east. Most enemies are to the north/west. I'll attack Doc then use shield_wall facing north to protect allies from Doc's direction.
  State: Wraith 2/4, Snare 1/6, Bastion 9/11, Hawk 4/4, Viper 4/6, Doc 7/9

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(5,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP. Viper is at (5,4) facing E — I'm already behind it, and (4,4) is reachable and adjacent. Doc is the medic at (2,5) and is dangerous to leave alive. I have breach ready. Moving to (4,4) puts me behind Viper and adjacent. I should use breach on Viper to neutralize it (it's a vector denying my abilities, and controlling it removes that threat). Breach from (4,4) targeting (5,4) while behind = valid.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare (vector, critical) is at (2,3), exactly 3 tiles away and in range for precision_shot. Orders say medics first then damage dealers — but Snare is critical and a vector (denial class that blocks my abilities if adjacent). Eliminating Snare now removes a major threat. I'm at (0,2), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is valid. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. Snare is critical — 2dmg should finish it. No need to move first; stay at distance.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded at (5,4) needing a heal, but is 4 tiles away — out of reach. Bastion (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,4), which blocks my patch/overclock abilities. I need to reposition away from Bastion to unblock my abilities, then try to get closer to Viper. Moving to (3,5) gets me away from Bastion and slightly closer to Viper. From (3,5) Bastion is at dist=2 (no longer adjacent), so patch is unblocked — but Viper is still 3 away, not adjacent. Best I can do this turn is reposition toward Viper. No adjacent wounded allies to heal right now.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(5,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,4) and wounded — pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will deal 1 damage to Wraith. I'm at 4/6 HP so staying in melee is risky, but finishing off a wounded Wraith is worth it. After pulsing, I'll move to (4,5) to reposition slightly while keeping pressure. Trap would be blocked since Wraith is adjacent.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Doc is closest at dist=2, to my NE at (3,5). I should advance toward Doc. Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Doc at (3,5) — I can then attack. But (3,4) is a trap tile — avoid it. Moving to (2,5) gets me closer to Doc (dist=2 from there) but not adjacent. Moving to (3,3) is also a trap. Best safe move toward Doc: (2,5) puts me at dist=2 from Doc, or I could try (1,5) but that's farther. Actually from (2,4), Doc is at (3,5): dx=1, dy=1. To get adjacent I need to be at (3,5)±1. (3,4) is a trap. (2,5) puts me at dist=1 from Doc — adjacent! dist from (2,5) to (3,5) = 1. Yes, move to (2,5) then attack Doc. Enemies cluster to the N/NE, so shield_wall N after attacking would be good, but I can only do move+ability. I'll move to (2,5) and attack Doc.

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Viper is adjacent at (4,5) and I'm in denial zone, so abilities are blocked except basic attack and movement. I'm already behind Viper (my position (4,4) is behind Viper facing N). I can't use breach due to denial. Shadow_strike requires adjacent and keeps cloak, but I'm not cloaked. Basic attack deals 1dmg to Viper. At 1HP I need to contribute before dying. Attack Viper for 1dmg, then move away to (5,4) to escape denial zone and survive.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(4,5) ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded at (4,5) with 3/6 HP and is adjacent to me (dist=1). I should move to get adjacent to Viper and use patch to heal them. From my position (3,5), Viper is at (4,5) which is distance 1 - already adjacent! I can patch Viper directly. Bastion enemy is at (2,5) dist=1, which blocks patch/overclock if adjacent to me. Bastion is adjacent to me, so patch is BLOCKED. I need to move away from Bastion first to use patch. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Viper at (4,5) and away from Bastion at (2,5). From (4,4), Viper at (4,5) is dist=1 so patch works.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest enemy is Bastion at dist=5. I need to close distance to get enemies in range (max range 3, or 4 with High Ground). Moving toward Bastion at (2,5) — moving to (2,2) gets me closer. From (2,2), Bastion at (2,5) is dist=3, which is in range for precision_shot. Let me move to (2,2) first, then fire precision_shot on Bastion.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(5,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical at (5,4) and within range 2. I can attack Wraith directly to finish them off. Bastion is healthy at (2,5), out of immediate threat range. After attacking Wraith, I should place a trap on a likely movement path for Bastion. Bastion is moving north, so (3,5) or (2,4) would be good trap locations. I can move to (3,5) to get closer to Bastion's path and place a trap there, but first priority is eliminating the critical Wraith with an attack.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Nearest enemies are Hawk at (2,2) dist=3 and Viper at (4,5) dist=2. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Viper is closest at dist=2, but I must avoid moving adjacent to Viper (vector denial). Hawk is at (2,2), I can move toward them via (2,4) or (2,3). Moving to (2,3) brings me dist=1 from Hawk. Enemies are mostly to the south/east. Shield_wall facing E or S would protect against most threats. Viper is at (4,5) east of me, Doc at (4,4) southeast, Hawk at (2,2) south. I'll move to (2,3) to approach Hawk, then shield_wall facing S to block Hawk's approach next turn.
  State: Wraith 1/4, Bastion 8/11, Hawk 4/4, Viper 6/6, Doc 6/9 | Dead: Snare

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Doc is adjacent at (4,4). I'm uncloaked. Shadow_strike deals 2dmg, keeps cloak status (but I'm not cloaked), and works adjacent. Regular attack is 1dmg. Viper is 2 tiles away so I can't use abilities freely near it — but shadow_strike should still work since Viper only blocks cloak/breach when adjacent (I'm not adjacent to Viper, I'm 2 tiles away). Doc is adjacent and healthy. I should shadow_strike Doc for 2dmg (medics are high value targets), then move away to survive. Moving to (5,3) or (5,5) gets me away from Doc. After shadow_strike I should flee — move to (5,5) to put distance between me and enemies.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → overclock(4,5) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 4/9 HP and 1 heal remaining. Wraith (enemy specter) is critical at (5,5), dist=2. Viper (ally vector) is at (4,5) with full HP - adjacent to Wraith. I need to support Viper who is closest to the critical enemy. I'm wounded myself (4/9) but can't self-heal. No allies are wounded. Orders say use overclock on damage dealer if all healthy - Viper is adjacent and is a damage dealer. Move to (5,4) to get adjacent to Viper, then overclock Viper to help finish off the critical Wraith.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel) is adjacent at (2,3) — this blocks precision_shot due to adjacency rule (WARNING: precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy). I need to move away first. Bastion is healthy and right on top of me. I should retreat south or to the side to open distance, then use precision_shot on Bastion. Moving to (3,1) puts me 2 tiles from Bastion and gives me range on it. Actually, let me move to (4,2) — distance from Bastion would be ~2.2 tiles (dist=2 diag), freeing precision_shot. From (4,2), Bastion at (2,3) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, so not adjacent. That enables precision_shot for 2dmg. Wraith is at dist=6, out of range. Priority: eliminate or damage Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy (Hawk at 4,2, dist=3). I can move up to 2 tiles. Moving to (4,3) closes distance to Hawk while staying off the trap at (3,3). From (4,3) Hawk is at dist=1 (adjacent), but that's after moving. Enemies are mostly to the E, so shield_wall facing E makes sense. I'll move to (3,2) to avoid trap at (3,3) and get closer to Hawk - actually (4,3) is a valid move tile and puts me adjacent to Hawk. Wait, (3,3) is a trap - avoid it. (4,3) is valid. Moving to (4,3) puts me dist=1 from Hawk at (4,2) - adjacent! Then I can attack Hawk.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(5,5) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical and adjacent at (5,5) - pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Wraith. Bastion is at (4,3) dist 2, not in pulse range. Pulse first to potentially finish Wraith, then move to better position. Doc is wounded at (5,4) so I need to be careful pulse doesn't hit Doc - wait, Doc is at (5,4) which is within 1 tile of my position (4,5). Pulse would hit Doc too. Better to attack Wraith directly since it's critical - attack does 1dmg at adjacent range. Or use pulse: hits Wraith (good, critical) and Doc (bad, wounded ally). Attack is safer - 1dmg to Wraith at adjacent range. After attacking, move to (3,4) to set up trap coverage near enemy approach routes.
  State: Bastion 7/11, Hawk 3/4, Viper 6/6, Doc 4/9 | Dead: Wraith, Snare

### Turn 8 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded at 3/4 HP and dist=3 from me. I need to get adjacent to heal. Valid moves include (4,4) which puts me at dist=1 from Hawk at (4,2)? No, dist from (4,4) to (4,2) is 2 - not adjacent. Let me check (5,3): dist to Hawk(4,2) = |5-4|+|3-2|=2, not adjacent. (4,4) to Hawk(4,2): |4-4|+|4-2|=2, not adjacent. I can't reach adjacent to Hawk this turn. Best move is (4,4) to get closer to Hawk and also closer to the action. From (4,4) I'm dist=1 from Bastion at (4,3) - that's risky. Try (5,3): dist to Bastion(4,3)=1, adjacent - also risky. (4,5): dist to Hawk=3, dist to Bastion=3. I can't reach Hawk this turn. Move to (4,4) to get closer, and wait since I can't heal from here.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,3), which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (5,3) puts me 1 tile away diagonally — dist still 1. Better: move to (3,3) or (5,1) to get dist>1. Moving to (5,3) keeps dist=1 (still adjacent). Move to (3,1) gives dist to Bastion = sqrt((4-3)^2+(3-1)^2) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.2, so dist=2 tiles. Valid. From (3,1) I can use precision_shot on Bastion at (4,3): dist= |4-3|+|3-1|=3, within range 3. That enables precision_shot for 2 damage.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (4,3), wounded and adjacent to me. I already have a trap at (3,5). I should place a trap on a tile Bastion is likely to move through. Bastion is facing E, so it might move to (5,3) or (4,4). I can reach (4,5) to place a trap there, cutting off escape routes. But more importantly, Bastion is at dist=2 - I can attack directly or use pulse. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Bastion is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach. Attack range is adjacent only (dist=1), so I can't attack from here. Best play: move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Bastion (and apply Denial passive), then attack. But Doc is at (4,4) - can't move there. Move to (3,3) gets me closer. Actually, I should place a trap on (4,4) or (5,3) where Bastion might flee. I can place trap at (4,5) from current position (dist=2). Then move toward Bastion. Or: move to (5,4) - wait, that's in valid moves. From (5,4) I'm adjacent to Bastion at (4,3)? dist = |5-4|+|4-3| = 2, not adjacent. Let me recalculate adjacency. Adjacent means dist=1. From (3,4), Bastion at (4,3) is dist=2. I need to be at (4,3) neighbors: (3,3),(5,3),(4,2),(4,4). (3,3) and (4,5) are in valid moves. Move to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (4,3) - dist=1, enabling attack and Denial passive. Then attack Bastion for 1 damage.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) W ✓
  💭 Doc (wounded medic) is adjacent at (4,4) and Viper is adjacent at (3,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemy. Doc is wounded so attacking her is high value. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. I'll attack Doc first, then use shield_wall facing West (toward Viper and Hawk at x=3) to block incoming damage.
  State: Bastion 5/11, Hawk 3/4, Viper 5/6, Doc 3/9 | Dead: Wraith, Snare

### Turn 9 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel, wounded) is at dist=3, within precision_shot range. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. Orders say to prioritize high-value targets — Bastion is the only enemy visible. I can shoot from current position (3,1) for 2 damage since I won't move first. No medics visible. Staying at range is correct per orders.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with HP 3/9, adjacent to enemy Bastion at (4,3). My patch ability is blocked when adjacent to enemies. I need to move away from Bastion to use patch. Viper is closest at dist=2 at (3,3), wounded 5/6. Hawk is at (3,1) more wounded at 3/4. I should move to (3,4) to get adjacent to Viper and away from Bastion, then patch Viper. Wait - Viper is an ally vector at (3,3), moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Viper. But Hawk is more wounded percentage-wise (75% HP vs 83%). I only have 1 heal left. Hawk is at dist=4, too far. Move to (3,4) to be adjacent to Viper and patch Viper since they're reachable.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) W ✓
  💭 Viper is adjacent at (3,3) and in range. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified which gives 50% damage reduction - good to keep if possible. I'll attack Viper first, then use shield_wall facing West where most enemies are clustered (Viper at 3,3, Doc at 3,4, Hawk at 3,1).
- **Viper** (vector): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,3), wounded. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - that's just Bastion since Doc is at (3,4) which is also within 1 tile... risky for Doc. Better to use attack on Bastion directly for 1dmg, then move to (4,4) to place trap blocking Bastion's likely retreat/movement path. Actually, Doc is wounded at (3,4) - pulse would hit Doc too. So use attack on Bastion instead. Then move to (2,3) to maintain distance and set up trap coverage. Wait - I should place a trap. But trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... I am a Vector and Bastion is adjacent, so trap is blocked. Attack Bastion first (1dmg to wounded Bastion could finish or pressure), then move away to place trap.
  State: Bastion 3/11, Hawk 3/4, Viper 5/6, Doc 3/9 | Dead: Wraith, Snare

### Turn 10 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (4,3), dist=3, wounded. I'm at (3,1) with no adjacent enemies so High Ground passive gives +1 range. precision_shot is valid at range≤3. I haven't moved so full 2dmg applies. Shoot Bastion to finish or heavily damage. Stay at current position to keep LoS and range.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Hawk is at dist=3, Viper is at dist=2. Bastion is critical at dist=2. I should move toward Viper to stay adjacent to a wounded ally and potentially use overclock. Moving to (2,3) would put me on Viper's tile - not valid. Move to (2,4) gets me closer to Viper at (2,3), dist=1. Then I can use overclock on Viper to boost their damage output against Bastion. Note: overclock requires adjacent - from (2,4) Viper at (2,3) is adjacent. However, Bastion at (4,3) is not adjacent to (2,4) so overclock won't be blocked. Let me move to (2,4) then overclock Viper.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) W ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with only 2HP, fortified for 50% damage reduction. Viper is 2 tiles away at (2,3) - I must not move adjacent to it. Enemies are mostly to the west. I should advance toward Hawk at (3,1) while staying clear of Viper. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Hawk without being adjacent to Viper at (2,3). Then shield_wall facing W to cover against Viper and Doc who are to the west.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is critical at (3,2) and within range 2. I'm overclocked so I get 2 ability uses. Attack Bastion to finish them off, then place a trap on a likely movement corridor. Bastion is at dist=2 so attack is valid.
  State: Bastion 2/11, Hawk 3/4, Viper 4/6, Doc 3/9 | Dead: Wraith, Snare

### Turn 11 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I need to move away first to use it. Moving to (4,1) puts me at dist 2 from Bastion (still in range 2+High Ground=3), away from adjacent, and avoids trap at (3,3). Then precision_shot Bastion who is critical — finish them off.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Viper is adjacent at (2,3) - wounded at 4/6 HP. I can't heal. Bastion is at dist=3, not in melee range. Best option: move toward Viper to stay adjacent and use overclock on them to boost their damage output against Bastion. Viper is at (2,3), I'm at (2,4) - already adjacent! Use overclock on Viper (2,3) to give them 2 abilities next turn against Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Hawk is at (4,1) dist=2, Viper at (2,3) dist=2. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Hawk and Viper are roughly equal distance. Moving to (4,2) gets me adjacent to Hawk at (4,1) and keeps distance from Viper. But I need to avoid moving adjacent to Viper (denial range). If I move to (4,2), Viper at (2,3) is 3 tiles away - safe. From (4,2), Hawk at (4,1) is adjacent - I can attack. Enemies are mostly to the W/NW from current position. After moving to (4,2), enemies: Hawk at N, Viper at NW, Doc at NW. Shield_wall facing N or W. N covers Hawk direction best.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Bastion is at (4,2), critical HP, dist=3. I can't reach with attack (adjacent only) or trap (range ≤2). I have traps at (3,5) and (3,3). Bastion is at (4,2) facing E - likely to move east or stay. If I move to (3,2), dist to Bastion becomes 1, but I'd be adjacent and my trap ability would be blocked. Better to move to (3,4) to get closer while staying out of adjacent range, then place a trap at (4,3) or (4,4) to block Bastion's path. Actually, move to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (4,2) - that blocks THEIR abilities but also blocks my trap. Move to (3,4) instead, then place trap at (4,2)... Bastion is already there. Place trap at (4,3) to intercept movement. From (3,4) dist to (4,3) is sqrt(1+1)=1.4 ≤ 2, valid. Second ability: place another trap at (5,2) or (4,1) - but (4,1) has Hawk. (5,2) from (3,4) is dist ~2.8 > 2. Place at (4,4) from (3,4): dist=sqrt(1+0)=1 ≤ 2, valid. This covers Bastion's likely escape routes.
