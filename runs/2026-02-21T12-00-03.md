## Squads
### Player
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
### Opponent
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(4,0) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Weaver who is closest at dist 4. Moving to (4,3) gets me 1 tile closer while staying in column to approach Weaver from behind next turn.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(2,4) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, time to cloak. Both enemies are 4 tiles away, out of range. I'll cloak first, then move south toward Bolt (the priority target - enemy damage dealer) to get into assassination position next round.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Aegis is 4 tiles away, Bolt is 6. I need to advance to get Aegis in range (need dist≤2 for precision_shot). Moving to (3,3) closes to dist=2 from Aegis at (3,1), putting them in range. Ghost is at (2,2) providing nearby ally support. I'll move forward to engage.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,2) ✗ Position occupied → precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Longshot is at (3,3) distance 4, Weaver at (4,4) distance 6. My range is 2. I need to close to within 2 tiles of Longshot. Moving to (3,0) gets me to distance 3 from Longshot - still not in range. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer but still dist=3 from (3,3). Best move: go to (2,2) via (2,1) - that puts me at distance ~2 from Longshot at (3,3)? Dist from (2,2) to (3,3) = |3-2|+|3-2| = 2. That's in range! But I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg. Still worth it to get into position. Let me check: (2,2) to (3,3) = sqrt(1+1) ≈ 1.41, but game likely uses Chebyshev or Manhattan. If Chebyshev: max(1,1)=1, in range. If Manhattan: 2, in range. Either way, Longshot at (3,3) would be in range from (2,2). Move to (2,2), then precision_shot Longshot for 1dmg (moved penalty). LoS check - no blockers mentioned.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,3) ✗ Position occupied → trap(3,2) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Aegis is at (3,1) approaching from the south, Bolt at (2,0). My allies Ghost is at (2,2) and Longshot at (3,3). I should move south to place a trap between the enemies and our formation. Moving to (4,3) puts me closer to the action. Then I can place a trap at (3,2) — between Aegis at (3,1) and Longshot at (3,3) — which is within my 2-tile trap range from (4,3). This will punish Aegis if it advances north.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is 2 tiles away at (3,3), directly north. I need to move toward the front line to intercept threats. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Longshot, allowing an attack. This also positions me between allies Bolt@(2,0) and Veil@(4,3) and the enemies. After moving, I'll attack Longshot who will be adjacent.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Bolt 5/5, Veil 5/5, Ghost 5/5, Weaver 7/7, Longshot 4/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) facing N, so (3,1) is behind them. I can move to (3,1) first, then breach Aegis from behind — making them obey me next turn. This disrupts the sentinel's defensive posture as ordered. Bolt is out of reach this turn.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining, adjacent to Weaver (vector) whose denial zone blocks my abilities. I need to move away from Weaver's denial zone first, then use shadow_strike. Moving to (3,4) puts me behind Longshot — I can shadow_strike Longshot while maintaining cloak. Longshot is a priority target (striker at dist=1). Moving to (3,4) gets me behind Longshot and out of Weaver's denial zone.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is at dist=2 and healthy, within precision_shot range. I'm at (2,0) facing N, not adjacent to Ghost so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire precision_shot at Ghost for 2dmg. No movement needed since Ghost is already in range. Wait as second action to hold position.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,4) ✗ Position occupied → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) - this blocks precision_shot per the WARNING. I need to move away first to get range ≥2, then use precision_shot. Moving to (3,5) puts me at distance 3 from Aegis - too far for precision_shot range ≤2. Moving to (3,4) gives dist=2 from Aegis at (3,2), which is within precision_shot range and no longer adjacent. That's the play: move to (3,4), then precision_shot Aegis.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at (4,4), allies Ghost@(3,1) and Longshot@(3,3) are wounded. Aegis@(3,2) is between my wounded allies and threatening them. I need to place a trap on a chokepoint between Aegis and my allies. Moving to (3,4) puts me closer and lets me place a trap at (3,3) area or between Aegis at (3,2) and Ghost at (3,1). Actually, placing a trap at (3,2) would be on Aegis's current tile - can't do that. I should place a trap at (3,3) to catch Aegis if it moves north toward Ghost, or at (4,3) as a defensive chokepoint. Moving to (4,3) first gives me range to place trap at (3,2) or (3,3). Best play: move to (4,3) to get within trap range of (3,2)-(3,3) corridor, then place trap at (3,3) to intercept Aegis moving toward Ghost.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. Allies are at (2,0) and (3,4). Edge tiles in valid moves: (5,2) is the furthest east edge tile, away from both allies. Moving to (5,2) gets me to the right edge and away from allies at (2,0) and (3,4). No ability needed, just execute the move.
  State: Aegis 10/12, Bolt 5/5, Veil 5/5, Ghost 2/5, Weaver 7/7, Longshot 3/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(3,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Longshot (wounded striker at 3,3) and adjacent to them. I'm currently at (3,4) facing N, and Longshot is facing S — so they're facing toward me, meaning I'm behind them. Shadow_strike keeps cloak, deals 1 damage, and works on adjacent enemies. Longshot is wounded so this could finish them or leave them near death. I should use shadow_strike on Longshot first (preserves cloak), then move to position behind Weaver at (4,4) for a future breach. Cloak has only 1 turn remaining — after this turn it expires, so I need to act decisively. Shadow_strike on Longshot (adjacent, behind) keeps cloak. Then move to (4,4) which is behind Weaver and sets up breach next turn.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 At 2/5 HP I need to be careful. Breach is on cooldown. Priority target is Bolt (enemy striker/damage dealer) at (2,0), dist 2 — but no behind tiles reachable. Aegis is reachable from behind at (4,2) but breach is on cooldown for 1 turn. Veil (enemy specter) is at (4,4) — I can reach (3,4) which is behind them, and shadow_strike keeps cloak. Move to (3,4) to get behind Veil, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. This positions me to breach Veil next turn if cooldown clears.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies out of range from current position (2,0). Longshot is wounded at (3,3) dist=4, need to close distance. Moving to (3,1) gets me dist=2 from Longshot at (3,3) - within precision_shot range. But I need to check if Weaver at (4,3) would be adjacent after move. From (3,1), Weaver at (4,3) is dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, not adjacent. Longshot at (3,3) is dist=2, within range. Move to (3,1) then precision_shot Longshot for 2 damage (finish wounded target). Moving first then shooting means precision_shot does 1dmg not 2dmg since I moved. Better: move to (2,2) - Longshot at (3,3) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41, that's within 2 tiles. Still moved so 1dmg. Or move to (2,1) - Longshot dist=sqrt(1+4)=2.2, out of range. Move to (3,1) - Longshot (3,3) dist=2, in range but 1dmg since moved. Wounded Longshot likely has low HP, 1dmg might finish. Take the shot.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → suppressing_fire(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically wounded. I need to survive. No wounded enemies to pick off. Bolt is at dist=2 directly south, threat. Veil at dist=2 northeast. I should retreat and use suppressing_fire to slow Bolt before retreating. Move to (2,4) to gain distance from Bolt, then suppressing_fire on Bolt to slow their advance.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. I'm at (5,2) facing E. My allies are Bolt at (3,1) and Veil at (4,4). Moving to (5,4) gets me toward the north edge and away from both allies. Valid moves include (5,3) and (5,4). I'll move to (5,4) to reach the edge. No ability needed.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) is adjacent at (4,4) - my Denial passive blocks her cloak. I should pulse to hit Veil and potentially Aegis at (5,4). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile from my position (4,3): Veil at (4,4) is 1 tile away (yes), Aegis at (5,4) is 2 tiles away (no). So pulse hits Veil. After pulsing, I can move to (5,3) to stay adjacent to Veil (keeping Denial active on her) and get closer to Aegis. Or I could move first to (5,3) then pulse - from (5,3), Veil at (4,4) is dist ~1.4 (diagonal, not in range for pulse which is 1 tile), Aegis at (5,4) is dist 1 (yes). Better to pulse from current position to hit Veil, then move to (5,3) to press Aegis with Denial.
  State: Aegis 10/12, Bolt 4/5, Veil 3/5, Ghost 2/5, Weaver 7/7, Longshot 1/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): breach(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Veil (enemy specter, wounded) at distance 1. I'm at (3,4) and Veil is at (4,4) facing E, so I'm behind them. I have breach ready and Veil is wounded — perfect target. Use breach first to take control of Veil, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying stealthy. Actually, breach makes them obey me next turn which is useful, but shadow_strike deals damage and keeps cloak. At 2HP I need to be careful. Veil is wounded so shadow_strike might finish them. Let me use breach on Veil (I'm already behind them at adj distance) to neutralize them, then shadow_strike for damage.
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from Aegis and allies and not attack. Aegis is at (5,4), Bolt is at (3,1). I need to move away from both. Valid moves away from allies: (4,5), (5,5), (5,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Moving to (4,5) or (5,5) gets away from the cluster. Ghost is adjacent at (3,4) so I want to avoid being near enemies too. (5,5) moves me away from allies and Ghost. No attack ordered.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so movement is limited to 1. Ghost is wounded at (3,4), distance 3 — within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 means out of range for precision_shot which needs ≤2 tiles). Recon confirms Ghost is 'inRange' from current position though. Let me reconsider: the recon says Ghost IS in range from (3,1). I haven't moved, so precision_shot should deal full 2dmg to the wounded Ghost. No adjacency to enemies so precision_shot isn't blocked. Best action: fire precision_shot at Ghost to finish it off. Then wait since I'm suppressed and repositioning doesn't help much.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically wounded. Priority is survival. Aegis is in range at dist=3 but I can't reach wounded Veil or Bolt. Moving toward enemies is suicidal at 1HP. I should retreat to safety. Valid retreat tiles: (1,5) moves me away from Aegis at (5,4). Precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2, Aegis is at dist=3 so out of precision_shot range. Best play: retreat to (1,5) to gain distance, then wait or use suppressing_fire if any enemy closes in. Actually I can't use abilities on Aegis at dist=3 with precision_shot (max range 2). Suppressing_fire also range ≤2. So I have no offensive options from current position. Retreat is the only viable action - move to (1,5) to increase distance from all enemies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. Veil is at (5,5) which is adjacent. Valid moves are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2). Moving to (5,2) takes me further from allies at (3,1) and (5,5) and toward the south edge. I'll move to (5,2) and wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (5,2) - my Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. Veil is wounded at (5,5) in range. I can attack Aegis to pressure them, then move to (5,4) to stay adjacent to Aegis (maintaining Denial) while getting closer to Veil. Or I could pulse to hit Aegis (only 1 tile away). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Aegis is at dist=1 so they'd be hit. No allies are within 1 tile of me. Best play: attack Aegis first (1dmg, adjacent), then move to (5,4) to close on Veil while keeping Denial pressure on Aegis.
  State: Aegis 9/12, Bolt 4/5, Veil 2/5, Ghost 2/5, Weaver 7/7, Longshot 1/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP, cloaked. No enemies in range. Bolt at (3,1) is the priority target (damage dealer) but no behind positions are reachable. Veil is wounded at (5,5) — also no behind positions reachable this turn. Aegis at (5,2) facing S, behind tile (5,3) is reachable but breach is exhausted. Best move: close on Bolt by moving to (3,2) — gets me adjacent distance 1 next turn for shadow_strike while staying mobile. Actually (2,2) keeps more options open. Let me move toward Bolt at (3,2) to set up shadow_strike next turn. I'll shadow_strike if I can get adjacent — move to (3,2) puts me dist 1 from Bolt at (3,1), adjacent, so I can shadow_strike immediately after moving.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and do not attack. I'm at (5,5), adjacent to Weaver at (5,4) — denial zone blocks abilities anyway. I need to move away from allies (Aegis at 5,2, Bolt at 3,1). Moving to (3,5) takes me away from allies and toward the top-left. Then wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (3,2) - precision_shot is BLOCKED when adjacent to enemy. I can use basic attack (adjacent only) for 1dmg, or move away first then use precision_shot for 2dmg. Ghost is wounded so I want to finish it. Move to (4,2) to get dist=2 from Ghost at (3,2), then precision_shot for 2dmg to kill it.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with 1HP - critical condition. Veil is wounded at (3,5), distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Veil is wounded so likely low HP - this could finish them. I should shoot first before any movement to preserve the full damage bonus.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,2) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is at (3,2) distance 2, critical HP — threat but not adjacent yet. Weaver is at (5,4) distance 2 north — I must avoid moving adjacent to it or abilities get blocked. Bolt is wounded at (4,2). I'm fortified at (5,2) with 50% damage reduction. Moving would break fortify. No enemies in melee range. Best play: stay put, keep fortify active, use shield_wall facing West toward Ghost to protect Bolt if Ghost advances.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → pulse(5,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (5,2) dist=2, in range. I'm at (5,4). My allies Ghost and Longshot are both critical. Priority: use Denial to block Aegis abilities by staying adjacent, or place a trap between Aegis and my critical allies. Moving to (5,3) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (5,2) - that activates Denial on Aegis (blocking scan, breach, etc.) and keeps me in position to threaten. Then I can pulse to hit Aegis for 1dmg since Aegis would be within 1 tile. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - at (5,3) Aegis at (5,2) is 1 tile away. This deals 1dmg to Aegis and denies their abilities next turn.
  State: Aegis 8/12, Bolt 3/5, Ghost 1/5, Weaver 7/7, Longshot 1/5 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 6 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Bolt is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded. I must eliminate Bolt now. Moving to (4,1) puts me behind Bolt and adjacent. Then shadow_strike keeps me cloaked while dealing 1dmg — if Bolt is wounded that should finish them. Shadow_strike is the right call since it preserves cloak and breach is unavailable.
- **Bolt** (striker): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,1) — critical HP, must die now. precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy, so I must use basic attack on Ghost to finish it. I have not moved yet, so attack is valid. After attacking Ghost, I should move away from Weaver who is at (5,3) and 2 tiles away — moving adjacent would block my abilities. Move to (3,2) to reposition safely away from Weaver.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP and both enemies are out of range (Bolt at dist 5, Aegis at dist 7). I need to close distance to get Bolt in range for precision_shot. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer to Bolt at dist=3, still not in range. Best move is toward Bolt - move to (2,4) first, then still out of range. I should move as far east as possible. (2,4) is my furthest east valid tile. Even at (2,4) Bolt is at dist=3, still out of range (need ≤2). I'm at 1HP so very vulnerable - but orders say prioritize killing wounded enemies. Moving to (2,4) reduces Bolt distance to ~3, not enough. Let me wait and hold position since I can't reach range this turn and moving exposes me.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(5,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (5,2) - my Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. I can pulse to deal 1dmg to Aegis (within 1 tile), then move away to (4,4) to maintain pressure and position for trap placement next turn. Pulse first while Aegis is adjacent, then reposition.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (5,2) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in attack range. Bolt is wounded at (3,2) to my west. Weaver is at (4,4) threatening from the north. Moving to (5,3) keeps me on the front line, stays adjacent to Bolt's position, and lets me use shield_wall north to protect against Weaver's threat direction. I should maintain fortify if possible, but positioning to shield Bolt is priority.
  State: Aegis 7/12, Bolt 2/5, Weaver 7/7, Longshot 1/5 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✗ Out of range → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at critical HP at (2,4), distance 3 — within precision_shot range. I'm at 2HP so I need to finish enemies fast. I haven't moved yet, so precision_shot fires at full 2dmg, which should kill Longshot. Weaver is healthy and 3 tiles away — stay out of adjacent range. Best play: shoot Longshot with precision_shot first (no move needed, full damage), then move to (3,1) to reposition away from threats.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 1HP - critically low. Aegis is wounded at (4,3) and in range (dist=3). I'm a Striker so precision_shot has range ≤2 tiles - dist 3 is OUT of range. Need to close to range 2. Moving to (3,3) puts me at dist 2 from Aegis (4,3): |4-3|+|3-3|=1+0... wait, (3,3) to (4,3) = dist 1. That's adjacent which blocks precision_shot. Move to (2,3) keeps dist to Aegis at |4-2|+|3-3|=2 - in range and not adjacent. But I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg. Aegis is wounded so 1dmg might finish them. At 1HP I must avoid getting hit - staying at (2,3) keeps distance. Alternatively move to (3,4): dist to Aegis = |4-3|+|3-4|=1+1=2, not adjacent, in range, and I moved so 1dmg. Either works. I'll use (3,4) to stay mobile. Fire precision_shot on Aegis for the kill.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (4,3) - wounded. My Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. Longshot is critical at (3,4). I should attack Aegis to finish them off, then move to block Bolt's approach path. Attack Aegis first, then reposition toward (4,5) to place a trap between Bolt's position and our allies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,3) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,3) with 50% damage reduction. Longshot is critical at (3,4) distance 2 — if I move to (4,4) I'd be adjacent to Longshot and could attack. But Weaver is at (4,5) and moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Weaver's denial zone which I must avoid. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Bolt (wounded at 3,1) to shield. Best play: stay fortified, use shield_wall North toward Weaver to protect myself and allies from incoming fire, preserving the 50% damage reduction.
  State: Aegis 5/12, Bolt 2/5, Weaver 7/7, Longshot 1/5 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critical and in range at dist=3. I'm at (3,1), Longshot at (3,4) - that's exactly 3 tiles, within precision_shot range of ≤2... wait, dist=3 exceeds precision_shot range of ≤2 tiles. So I cannot use precision_shot from here. I need to move closer. Moving to (3,3) puts me at dist=1 from Longshot at (3,4) - within precision_shot range. But I'm at 2HP and need to be careful. (3,3) is adjacent to Longshot at (3,4), which would block precision_shot per the WARNING. Let me try (3,2): dist to Longshot=(3,4) is 2, which is within range, and not adjacent so precision_shot is not blocked. Move to (3,2) then use precision_shot on Longshot. I haven't moved before the shot at (3,2)? Actually I'm moving first then shooting - that means I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg (reduced when moved). Longshot is critical so 1dmg should finish them.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,4) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,3) with 50% damage reduction. Weaver is 2 tiles away at (4,5) — I should not move adjacent to avoid denial. Bolt is wounded at (3,2) behind me. Best play: stay fortified, use shield_wall north to protect against Weaver's incoming threat direction.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (4,3) distance 2 - within trap range and within pulse range. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Aegis, enabling Denial to block their abilities and allowing a pulse hit. I can place a trap at (4,3) first to damage Aegis, or move closer and pulse. Best play: move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Aegis (activating Denial to suppress their abilities), then pulse to hit Aegis for 1 damage. Alternatively, place a trap between Bolt's approach path. Since Aegis is wounded and adjacent after move, pulse is high value.
  State: Aegis 4/12, Bolt 2/5, Weaver 7/7 | Dead: Veil, Ghost, Longshot

### Turn 9 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → suppressing_fire(4,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 2HP, facing Weaver at (4,4) dist=3. Precision_shot requires ≤2 tiles range, so I can't use it from here (dist=3). I need to stay away from adjacent to Weaver to keep abilities unblocked. Moving to (4,2) would put me at dist=2 from Weaver at (4,4), enabling precision_shot. But I need to check - if I move to (4,2), Weaver is at (4,4) which is 2 tiles away, within range=2. That's valid for precision_shot and not adjacent (adjacent=1 tile). However, Weaver is healthy so suppressing_fire to slow them might be better to keep them from closing in. Actually, precision_shot at dist=2 does 2dmg if I haven't moved... but I'd be moving first. If I move then shoot, precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). Suppressing_fire does 1dmg + slow, which equals the moved-penalty precision_shot but adds slow. Suppressing_fire from (4,2) targeting Weaver at (4,4) - the line goes from target (4,4) 2 tiles in a direction. I want the line to hit Weaver: target the tile and it hits enemies in a 2-tile line FROM target. So target (4,4) with direction S would hit (4,4) and (4,3) - but Aegis is at (4,3), friendly fire risk. Target (4,4) direction N hits (4,4) and (4,5). Move to (4,2), then suppressing_fire targeting (4,4) to slow Weaver.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (4,4) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack Weaver since it's in melee range. I cannot use shield_wall due to DENIAL zone, but basic attack still works. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus. Attack Weaver, then wait to keep fortification.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,3) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed (mv1) and adjacent to Aegis sentinel at (4,3). My Denial passive blocks Aegis from using scan/patch/etc. I have both enemies in range. Aegis is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded - I can attack for 1dmg. Bolt is at dist=2 and wounded. Pulse would hit Aegis (within 1 tile) for 1dmg and potentially finish them. Let me use pulse first to hit Aegis, then attack Aegis or move. Actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - that's just Aegis at dist=1. Pulse does 1dmg to Aegis. Then I can attack Aegis for another 1dmg. This could eliminate Aegis. I'm suppressed so only mv1 - staying put and using both abilities is best. Attack Aegis first (1dmg), then pulse to hit Aegis again (1dmg) - double hit on adjacent wounded Aegis.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (4,4), distance 2 — exactly in precision_shot range. I'm at (4,2) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Weaver is healthy so 2dmg won't kill, but it's the best damage option. I must NOT move adjacent to Weaver (4,3) or my abilities get blocked. Aegis is at (4,3) critical — I should not move there anyway. Staying at (4,2) gives clean LoS to Weaver at dist=2. Fire precision_shot first, then wait.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (4,4) and wounded. I'm at 2HP but fortified (50% DR). Basic attack works even in denial zone. Attack Weaver to finish them off, then wait to maintain fortify bonus.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Aegis is adjacent at (4,3) and my denial is suppressing their abilities. Bolt is at range 2. I cannot use trap while adjacent to Aegis. Best option: pulse to hit both Aegis (critical, 1HP likely) and potentially soften Bolt if I stay, but Bolt is at dist 2 so outside pulse range. Pulse will hit Aegis at dist 1 — if Aegis is critical that likely kills them. Then I should move away to survive. Move first to (5,5) to escape, then pulse won't reach Aegis. Better: pulse first (hits Aegis at dist 1, potentially finishing them), then move to (5,5) to get distance from Bolt.
