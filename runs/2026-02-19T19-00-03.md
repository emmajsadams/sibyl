## Squads
### Player
- **Longshot** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Shade** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Longshot at (3,1) who is the closest enemy. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while staying cloaked and out of range of Lattice's denial aura.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Enemies are far (dist 6-7), no combat possible yet. Move toward the flank while cloaking. I'll cloak first, then advance toward the enemy striker Hawk at (2,5) via the left flank.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (3,1). Closest enemy is Rampart at dist=4, Hawk at dist=5. My range is 3 (or 4 with High Ground if no adjacent enemies). Need to close distance. Moving to (3,3) gets me 2 tiles north, bringing Rampart at (2,4) to dist=2 — well within range 3. From (3,3) I should have LoS to Rampart. No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive applies giving range 4, but base range 3 is sufficient. After moving to (3,3), Rampart at dist=2 is in range for precision_shot (2dmg).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (3,3), dist=3, in range. I'm at (2,5) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive gives +1 range. Precision_shot deals 2dmg at range ≤3. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Take the shot first, then consider repositioning.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (3,3), distance 2 — not adjacent so can't attack yet. I need to close in. Moving to (2,3) gets me adjacent to Longshot at (3,3). Orders say push forward aggressively. Hawk is at (2,5) behind me, so I should advance. After moving to (2,3), Longshot is still at dist 1 diagonally — need to check adjacency. Actually (2,3) to (3,3) is distance 1, so that's adjacent. I can move to (2,3) then attack Longshot. Shield_wall facing N toward enemy cluster as secondary if no attack available, but attack takes priority.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range yet. Rampart is at (2,3) moving south toward me, Hawk at (2,5). I should move forward and place a trap on the central path to intercept Rampart's advance. Moving to (2,2) puts me at range 1 from Rampart's current position and lets me trap (2,3) or nearby tiles. Actually, move to (2,2) then trap (2,3) — that's the chokepoint Rampart will pass through. But wait, trap requires empty tile and range ≤2. From (2,2), (2,3) is distance 1, valid. This creates a mine on the central column that Rampart is likely to walk into.
  State: Lattice 6/6, Shade 4/4, Longshot 1/4, Rampart 10/11, Shade 4/4, Hawk 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk is the priority target (enemy damage dealer) but unreachable this turn. Rampart is at dist 2 and I can breach from behind by moving to (2,4) which is adjacent and behind. Breach on Rampart will make them obey me next turn, disrupting their sentinel posture. Move to (2,4) then breach Rampart.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critical HP and I'm already behind them from (3,2). Move to (3,2) first, then breach or shadow_strike. Shadow_strike keeps cloak, so I should use that to finish off Longshot without breaking cloak. Breach would be wasted on a critical target since shadow_strike + next round attack could kill. Save breach for Shade or Lattice. Move to (3,2) behind Longshot, then shadow_strike for 2 damage — likely kills the critical Longshot while staying cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Shade(specter) is adjacent at (2,4) — precision_shot requires LoS but I need to check if adjacent enemy blocks it. The CAUTION warns about Lattice(vector) blocking abilities if adjacent, not Shade. Shade is 1 tile away (adjacent). I should move away from Shade first to get range, then use precision_shot for 2dmg. Moving to (3,5) puts me 2 tiles from Shade at (2,4) and 3 tiles from Lattice at (2,2) — safe distance from both. From (3,5), Shade at (2,4) is dist ~1.4, in range. Alternatively move to (1,4) to get dist from Shade. Actually from (3,5): Shade(2,4) dist = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, in range ≤3. Precision shot for 2dmg (no movement penalty if I shoot after moving... wait, 1dmg if moved). Better to shoot first then move. But Shade is adjacent now — can I precision_shot an adjacent enemy? The warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to Vector, not specter. So I can precision_shot Shade at dist=1 for 2dmg, then move away.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) - my Denial passive is already blocking some of their abilities. I can pulse to hit Rampart for 1 damage (they're within 1 tile). I should also consider trapping a path. Hawk is far away. Pulse hits Rampart adjacent to me, and I should move away to avoid being surrounded. Let me pulse first for the damage, then reposition.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. Allies are at (3,2) and (3,5), so I should move west or south. Valid moves toward edges: (0,3) is the west edge, far from allies. I'll move there. Then I can attack the wounded Shade at (2,4) if still in range — but after moving to (0,3) Shade is at dist 3, out of range. So second action is wait.
  State: Lattice 6/6, Shade 2/4, Rampart 9/11, Shade 3/4, Hawk 4/4 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is the priority target (enemy damage dealer). I'm already behind Hawk and (2,5) is reachable and adjacent. Breach is on cooldown, so I'll use shadow_strike to deal 2 damage while staying cloaked. Move to (2,5) first to get adjacent behind Hawk, then shadow_strike.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I'm behind Lattice from (2,2) — move there first, then shadow_strike Lattice to deal 2 damage while staying cloaked. This keeps me hidden and eliminates Lattice if they're weakened, or at least chunks them.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Wounded Shade is adjacent at (2,5). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy... wait, that's Vector's denial. Shade is a specter, not a vector, so precision_shot should work. But I'm at 2HP and need to eliminate this threat. Shade is wounded - precision_shot does 2dmg which should finish it. However, I haven't moved so I get full 2dmg. But being adjacent (dist=1) - my range is ≤3 tiles so Shade qualifies. Fire precision_shot at Shade to kill it, then move to (4,5) to get distance from Lattice.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. Allies are at (2,2) and (4,5). The map edge closest to me while moving away from allies is the west edge (x=0) or south edge (y=0). I'm already at x=0 (west edge). Moving south toward (0,1) keeps me on the west edge and moves away from allies. I have move 2, so I can reach (0,1) in one move. That gets me further from Shade at (2,2) and Hawk at (4,5). I'll move to (0,1) to hug the southwest corner edge.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(1,2) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent (dist=1) at (2,2), Rampart is at (0,1) dist=2. My Denial passive blocks Shade's cloak since they're adjacent. Shade is healthy and a high-speed threat. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Shade at dist=1 would be hit. But I'm at 4/6 HP, so I want to be careful. I can pulse to hit Shade (adjacent), then move away. Or I can move first to create distance, then trap a chokepoint. Shade will likely pursue me. If I pulse now, I hit Shade for 1 dmg. Rampart is at dist=2, just outside pulse range. Let me pulse Shade first (1 dmg), then move to (0,3) to create distance and set up denial on Rampart's approach. Actually, pulse target is self-centered - target should be my own position (1,2). After pulsing, I should move away from both threats. Moving to (0,3) puts me away from Rampart at (0,1) and further from Shade.
  State: Lattice 4/6, Rampart 9/11, Shade 2/4, Hawk 2/4 | Dead: Shade, Longshot

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(0,2) ✓ → breach(0,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 2HP, cloaked facing W. Lattice (vector) is at (0,3) facing N, dist=3. The tile (0,2) is directly behind Lattice and reachable in one move. I should move to (0,2) to get behind Lattice, then use breach to take control. Breach from behind doesn't require adjacency — wait, breach requires being BEHIND enemy by facing and range ≤2. From (0,2) I'd be adjacent and behind. That's perfect. Breach is ready. This is the ideal moment to breach Lattice — neutralizing the vector's denial ability for a turn and using them as a puppet.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice is at distance 6, out of my range 3 (or 4 with high ground). No enemies adjacent so I have high ground passive. Need to close distance. Move toward (2,5) to get closer while staying elevated. Still won't be in range after one move of 2, but repositioning for next turn.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(0,3) ✓ → trap(0,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Shade is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded - pulse will hit both Shade and possibly Rampart. Shade is at (0,2) which is 1 tile south, Rampart at (0,1) is 2 tiles south. Pulse hits all within 1 tile of me at (0,3), so it hits Shade at (0,2) for 1dmg. Rampart is at dist=2 so outside pulse range. Shade is wounded so 1 more damage could finish or cripple them. After pulse, I can place a trap on a tile enemies must pass through. Rampart is moving north toward me. I'll pulse first to damage Shade, then place a trap at (0,2) or (1,2) to catch Rampart advancing.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge. Allies are Shade at (0,2) and Hawk at (2,5). I'm at (0,1). Moving toward the bottom edge (y=0) and away from allies. Valid moves include (0,0) which is the bottom-left corner — furthest from allies, at the map edge. I'll move to (1,0) first then (0,0)... wait, mv=2 so I can reach (0,0) directly. Move to (0,0) — bottom edge, away from allies. Then wait.
  State: Lattice 4/6, Rampart 9/11, Shade 1/4, Hawk 2/4 | Dead: Shade, Longshot

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): attack(0,3) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP and adjacent to Lattice with DENIAL active — abilities are blocked except basic attack/movement. I can't use shadow_strike or breach here. I'm already behind Lattice (facing N, I'm at south). Best play: basic attack Lattice for 1 damage, then move away to safety since I'm critically low on HP.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,4) ✓ → precision_shot(0,3) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (0,3), distance 4 — just out of range (max 3). I need to close to range 3. Moving to (1,4) gets me distance sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 from... wait, dist to (0,3) from (1,4) = sqrt(1+1)=1.4? No: |1-0|+|4-3|=2. That's in range! Let me verify: from (1,4), Chebyshev or Manhattan? Dist shown as 4 from (2,5) — Manhattan: |2-0|+|5-3|=4. From (1,4): |1-0|+|4-3|=2. That's well within range 3. I can move to (1,4) then use precision_shot on Lattice. Lattice is wounded — priority kill. At (1,4) I won't be adjacent to Lattice, so precision_shot is not blocked. I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). Still worth it to finish off a wounded enemy.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(1,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,3) with 2HP - critically low. Hawk is wounded at (1,4), distance 2, and in range. I should attack Hawk to potentially finish him off. Moving away isn't great since I need to stay relevant. I can attack Hawk from current position. After attacking, I could place a trap to deny approach paths. Rampart at (0,0) is approaching from south - a trap at (0,1) or (0,2) would block that path. Let me attack Hawk first, then place a trap on the southern approach to deny Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,2) ✓ → shield_wall(0,3) N ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (0,3), distance 3. I can move up to 2 tiles. Moving to (0,2) closes distance to 1 — adjacent and in attack range. But caution note says avoid moving adjacent to Lattice. Moving to (0,2) puts me at distance 1 from Lattice at (0,3), which IS adjacent. The caution is about my OWN abilities being blocked, not about attacking. Actually the caution says Lattice's denial range is adjacent — so if I move adjacent to Lattice, my abilities get blocked. Better to move to (0,2) which is distance 1 from (0,3)... wait, (0,2) to (0,3) is distance 1 = adjacent. That triggers Lattice's denial. So I should stay back or move to a non-adjacent tile. Valid moves include (0,1) which is distance 2 from Lattice — not adjacent. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move to (0,2) would be adjacent to Lattice but my attack would be blocked. Move to (0,1) keeps distance 2. Actually attack range is adjacent only, so from (0,1) I still can't attack Lattice at (0,3) — that's distance 2. I'll move to (0,2) to be adjacent and attack, accepting that vector denial blocks abilities... but attack IS an ability. So moving adjacent to Lattice blocks my attack. I'm stuck: to attack I need adjacency, but adjacency blocks attack. Best play: move to (0,2) to pressure and threaten, use shield_wall facing N to protect allies, preserving fortify is lost since I'm moving.
