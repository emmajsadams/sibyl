I should consider overclock on Warden to let the sentinel act twice — but overclock costs Warden 1HP (takes damage), bringing them to 4/10, which is risky but Warden has more HP buffer. Insight is blocking and adjacent — if I attack Insight I deal 1 damage to a healthy oracle. Better plan: move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Marksman — wait, dist to Marksman is 2 from current position and my moves don't include (5,3) or close enough. Valid moves include (4,3) and (4,4). Moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Insight. From (4,3) I could overclock Marksman at (5,3) if adjacent — dist from (4,3) to (5,3) is 1, yes! So: move to (4,3), then overclock Marksman so they get 2 actions next turn. Marksman at 2/4 losing 1HP goes to 1/4 — risky but double actions for a striker could be decisive. Actually overclock target takes 1dmg (the ally), so Marksman goes 1HP. Too risky. Instead: overclock Warden at (2,3) — but from (4,3) Warden is at distance 2, not adjacent. From current (3,3), Warden at (2,3) is dist=1, adjacent! So overclock Warden now, then move away from Insight. Overclock Warden: Warden takes 1dmg → 4/10, gets 2 abilities next turn.

Moving to (3,5) closes to dist 1 from Insight. With overclocked I have 2 ability uses — I can't attack from current pos, but after moving to (3,5) Insight is adjacent. However, ability use is pre-declared. I'll move to (3,5) as first action, then use attack on Insight at (2,5) as second action — but Insight is at (2,5) and I'd be at (3,5), distance 1 diagonally... wait, is diagonal adjacent? Typically adjacent means NSEW only. Distance from (3,5) to (2,5) is 1 tile west — that IS adjacent. Attack!",
