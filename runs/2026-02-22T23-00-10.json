Move to (2,1) and place trap at (3,2) to block Hawk's path? Actually, Hawk is wounded at dist=2 - if I move to (3,2) I'd be adjacent but Aegis ally is there. Let me move to (3,1) - wait Longshot is there. I can move to (2,1) and place a trap at (3,2) to threaten Hawk, but Aegis ally might step on it. Better: move toward Hawk to get adjacent and attack, or place trap on Hawk's likely path. Move to (3,3) is blocked by trap already there. Move to (2,1) and place trap at (3,2) - that's between Hawk and allies but ally Aegis is AT (3,2). Safest: stay at (2,2), use pulse - but Hawk is at dist=2, pulse only hits within 1 tile.

Move toward (4,2) Hawk: I can reach (3,2) if ally wasn't there, or go around. Actually can I move to (2,1) and trap (3,2) even with ally? Trap says empty tile. So no. Let me attack Hawk - need to be adjacent. From (2,2) I can move to (3,2) blocked by ally. I'll move to (2,1) to reposition, and place trap at (3,2) - no, ally there.
