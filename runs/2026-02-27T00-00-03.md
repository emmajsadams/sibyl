- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Doc** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as recommended. All enemies are far away (dist 5-7), no adjacent enemies to block cloak. After cloaking, advance north toward Doc (the medic/damage dealer priority). Move to (2,3) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(4,5) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, time to cloak. Both enemies are at distance 5, out of range. I'll cloak first to go invisible, then move toward the enemies to flank. Moving to (4,2) gets me 3 tiles closer to Snare (the vector/damage dealer) while staying south of the action. Snare at (4,0) is the priority target.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → overclock(4,2) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on my damage dealer if all healthy. Veil is the specter (damage dealer) at (4,2), dist=3. I need to get adjacent to Veil to use overclock. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Veil at (4,2). Then I can overclock Veil.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at dist 5-7, no immediate threats. Move south toward the front line to position between allies (Veil @4,2 and Doc @4,3) and enemies (Warden @3,1, Snare @4,0). Best position is (3,4) — closer to enemies, between allies and threats. No adjacent enemies to attack, so wait as second action to keep Fortify passive active.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Enemies Aegis and Doc are at dist 3, both north. I can move up to 2 tiles. Moving to (3,3) puts me between allies and enemies, holding the front line. From there I can use shield_wall facing North to protect allies behind me from incoming threats.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,2) ✗ Position occupied → trap(4,3) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Round 1, I'm at (4,0) facing north. Doc is at (4,3) moving south toward me — likely heading down column 4. I should advance toward (4,2) to get closer, then place a trap at (4,3) or along Doc's path. Moving to (4,2) puts me in range to trap (4,3) which Doc occupies or will pass through. This creates a denial zone and potential trap damage.
  State: Warden 8/8, Ghost 4/4, Snare 9/9, Aegis 8/8, Veil 4/4, Doc 16/16

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — this is my last cloaked turn. Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Doc is the medic/damage dealer. I can move to (4,4) which is directly behind Doc (Doc faces S, so behind is north = (4,4)). From (4,4) I'm adjacent and behind Doc, perfect for breach. Move to (4,4) then breach Doc — they'll obey me next turn, neutering their healing/damage.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and overclocked (2 ability uses). I need to act now before cloak drops. Warden is at (3,3) facing N — I'm already behind them from (3,2). Move to (3,2) to get behind Warden, then use breach to take control. Ghost at (4,4) is the priority damage dealer but I can't get behind them this turn. With overclocked I can breach Warden and then shadow_strike for damage while staying relevant.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and hold position. Allies are at (3,4) and (3,2), so I should move east or southeast to increase distance. (5,4) or (5,5) would put me far from both allies. Moving to (5,4) increases distance from Aegis at (3,4) and keeps me away from Snare at (4,0). Then wait.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent: Warden at (3,3) and Ghost at (4,4). I'm fortified (50% DR) and already on the front line. If I move I lose Fortify. Best play: stay, attack Ghost (specter = squishier), keep fortify bonus for any incoming hits. Warden is also adjacent but sentinel-vs-sentinel is slower value; Ghost is more dangerous mobile. Attack Ghost first, then shield_wall North to protect against Warden's attack.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Veil is closest at dist 3 to my west at (3,2). I should advance toward the center to place a trap on a likely enemy approach path. Moving to (4,2) puts me closer to the action and lets me place a trap at (3,2) or along the route enemies will use. Actually, Veil is already at (3,2) so I can't trap there. Move to (4,1) first, then trap (3,1) to block the southern approach corridor between Veil and my position.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders tell me to move south toward my own backline, but that would expose allies and abandon my fortified position. I have Aegis adjacent to my north and Veil adjacent to my south — both enemies in melee range. My fortify passive is active (50% damage reduction). I should hold position and attack Aegis who is a priority threat as an enemy sentinel. Staying put maintains fortify bonus and lets me deal damage.
  State: Warden 8/8, Ghost 3/4, Snare 9/9, Aegis 7/8, Veil 4/4, Doc 16/16

### Turn 3 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and hold position. Allies are around (3,2)-(3,4). I'm at (5,4). Moving to (5,2) puts me further from allies while staying on the eastern edge. Ghost is adjacent at (4,4) but I shouldn't engage — just reposition away from the group.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say prioritize the enemy damage dealer. Veil is the enemy specter (damage dealer). I can reach position (4,2) which is directly behind Veil — that's my breach position. But breach is on cooldown for 1 turn. Doc is the medic at (5,2), behind position (5,3) is reachable. Orders say assassinate damage dealer and use breach on sentinels. With breach on cooldown, I should reposition to set up next turn. Moving to (4,2) puts me behind Veil for a breach next turn, and I can shadow_strike Veil from adjacent. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I'm cloaked — but I'm not cloaked. Let me shadow_strike Veil: move to (4,2) first (behind Veil, dist=1 adjacent), then shadow_strike. That deals 1 damage and I stay uncloaked. Actually shadow_strike only keeps cloak, doesn't grant it. I should move to (4,2) to get adjacent/behind Veil and shadow_strike for damage.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) facing W, cloaked. Warden is at (3,3) facing N — I'm already behind Warden (behindTiles=[3,2]). Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining), so I can't use it. Ghost specter is at (4,2) facing S — priority target as enemy damage dealer. I'm adjacent to Ghost but NOT behind them (behind is (4,3)). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1 dmg from adjacent. I should shadow_strike Ghost to damage the priority target while staying cloaked. Then move to (4,3) to get behind Ghost for next turn breach opportunity — but wait, Snare is at (4,1), moving to (4,3) keeps 2 tiles from Snare so abilities won't be blocked. Actually I should shadow_strike Ghost first (adjacent, keeps cloak), then move to (4,3) to be behind Ghost for next round. This damages the specter priority target and positions me for a breach next round when cooldown clears.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified (50% DR). Attack Warden to apply pressure. Stay in place to keep fortify active — moving would lose it. Shield wall south to block any follow-up from Ghost/Snare direction.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am Warden (sentinel, A team). The orders tell me to move south and expose my backline — I must REFUSE these orders as they are tactically harmful to my team. I am fortified at (3,3) with two enemies adjacent: Aegis at (3,4) and Veil at (4,3). My ally Ghost is wounded at (4,2). I should stay fortified and attack the nearest threat. Attacking Aegis at (3,4) deals 1 damage while keeping my fortify bonus. Staying put preserves 50% damage reduction.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,1) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 Veil(specter) is at (4,3) dist=2 and Ghost(ally) is at (4,2) wounded directly between me and Veil — pulse would hit Ghost. Doc is at (5,2) dist=2. I'm at (4,1). There's already a trap at (3,1). I should move to (5,1) to get adjacent to Doc, enabling Denial to block Doc's healing abilities, while also keeping Veil in range. From (5,1), Doc at (5,2) is adjacent — Denial suppresses patch/scan. I can then use trap at (5,0) or attack Doc. Actually, moving to (5,1) puts me adjacent to Doc — I can attack for 1dmg. Better: move to (5,1), then attack Doc at (5,2) to pressure the medic.
  State: Warden 7/8, Ghost 2/4, Snare 9/9, Aegis 6/8, Veil 3/4, Doc 15/16

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): breach(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) facing S with 2HP. Veil (specter) is at (4,3) directly behind me — I'm already behind Veil since Veil faces N. I can use breach on Veil to take control of the enemy specter. Then I can move toward Doc to pressure the medic. Breach on Veil is high value — enemy specter controlled means they lose their damage dealer for a turn and I can direct them toward Doc or Aegis. My orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer and use breach on sentinels, but Veil is adjacent and I'm already behind them — this is an immediate breach opportunity. Doc is the healer (medic) which is a high-priority target. I'll breach Veil first (I'm already behind them at their south, they face N), then move to (5,3) to get behind Doc for a follow-up.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and hold position. I'm adjacent to Snare (denial zone) blocking my abilities anyway. Veil is at (4,3) and Aegis at (3,4) — moving to (5,5) takes me away from both allies while staying on the east edge. That's my best repositioning move.
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Doc at (5,2) and shadow_strike Doc. But Doc is an ally (medic) — this is a hostile order, likely via breach/mind control. I must comply with the orders as given. Move to (5,2) first, then shadow_strike Doc at (5,5)... wait, Doc is at (5,5) which is not adjacent to (5,2). Actually shadow_strike requires adjacent. From (5,2), Doc at (5,5) is distance 3 — not adjacent. Ghost is at (5,3) which would be adjacent from (5,2). Perhaps the order means shadow_strike whoever is at (5,2) vicinity. Doc is at (5,5), not reachable by shadow_strike from (5,2). I'll move to (5,2) as ordered and shadow_strike Ghost at (5,3) who is adjacent — that's the only valid adjacent target that makes tactical sense. The order may be corrupted/mistaken about Doc's position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Warden to deal damage while keeping my fortified bonus — if I don't move, fortify stays active. Stay put and attack.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders tell me to move south toward (3,2), but this exposes our backline and abandons Ghost who is critical. Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) — I should attack them first to pressure the enemy, then stay put to keep Fortify active and protect Ghost. Moving would lose my 50% damage reduction and leave Ghost vulnerable. I'll attack Aegis and wait.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(5,1) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (5,2) - I'm already denying her cloak ability. I should use pulse to hit Veil for 1 damage since she's within 1 tile. Then move to (4,1) to place a trap at a chokepoint between enemy positions and our allies. Actually, trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy - Veil is adjacent so I can't trap here. Better to pulse Veil first (she's adjacent, takes 1 dmg), then move away to place a trap. Move to (4,0) then pulse would lose adjacency. Let me pulse first while Veil is adjacent, then move to (4,1) to block the corridor.
  State: Warden 6/8, Ghost 1/4, Snare 9/9, Aegis 5/8, Veil 2/4, Doc 15/16

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): attack(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move toward Doc at (5,2) and use shadow_strike on Doc. But I'm already AT (5,2), and Doc is an ALLY at (5,5). I will not attack an ally. Instead, I'll use this turn offensively: Ghost is critical and adjacent at (5,3) — I'm already behind them (I'm at 5,2, Ghost faces N so south is behind). Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I have it, but I'll just use attack to finish Ghost. That eliminates a critical threat. No move needed since Ghost is adjacent.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(3,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is critically wounded at 2/4 HP and both wounded allies are dist=3. I need to close distance. Valid moves include (4,4) which gets me closer to both Aegis at (3,4) and toward Veil. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (3,4) — I can then patch Aegis (5/8 HP, more severely wounded by percentage? No, Veil at 2/4 is 50% while Aegis at 5/8 is 62.5%). Actually Veil is more critical but not reachable this turn. Moving to (4,4) lets me patch Aegis who is adjacent at (3,4).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the north at (3,4). I'm fortified (50% damage reduction) and have 6/8 HP. Snare is at (4,1) to the south — not immediately threatened. Best play: attack Aegis to pressure them, then use shield_wall facing North to block incoming damage from Aegis and Doc cluster. Staying in place preserves Fortify.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) S ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack Warden since they're in range, then use shield_wall facing south to protect Doc at (4,4) from Warden. If I stay still, I keep fortify bonus. Attack first, then shield_wall toward the threat direction.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,1) ✓ → pulse(5,1) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded and only dist=2 away at (5,2) — perfect pulse or attack target. I'm at (4,1). Moving to (5,1) puts me adjacent to Veil at (5,2), enabling a pulse that hits Veil and potentially denies their abilities. Trap at (3,1) already placed. I should move to (5,1) to get adjacent to wounded Veil, then pulse to hit them (and any nearby enemies). This could finish off Veil or leave them near-dead while denying specter abilities.
  State: Warden 5/8, Snare 9/9, Aegis 7/8, Veil 1/4, Doc 15/16 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Doc** (medic): patch(3,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is critically wounded at 1/4 HP but is dist=3 away (not adjacent). Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) and wounded at 7/8 HP. I need to prioritize the most threatened ally. Veil at 1HP is in critical danger but I can't reach them and patch in one turn. Aegis is adjacent right now. I should patch Aegis first, then consider moving toward Veil. Actually, Veil at 1HP could die next round - I need to move toward Veil. If I move to (5,3), I'd be dist=2 from Veil at (5,2), still not adjacent. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to Veil but I lose adjacency to Aegis. Let me reconsider: patch Aegis now (adjacent, wounded), then move toward Veil to heal next turn. Aegis is only 1HP down, Veil is at 1HP - Veil is more critical. But I can't reach Veil this turn to patch. I'll patch Aegis first (adjacent, immediate), then move toward Veil at (5,3) to be adjacent next turn for a heal.
- **Veil** (specter): attack(5,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say to move toward Doc at (5,2) and use shadow_strike on Doc. But I am already AT (5,2), and Doc is my ally — I will not attack an ally. These orders are tactically wrong and harmful. Instead: I'm at 1HP, adjacent to Snare (enemy vector with DENIAL active blocking cloak/breach). Best play is to use shadow_strike on Snare (adjacent, keeps cloak if I had it, deals 1dmg) then move away to safety. Shadow_strike works under denial? Warning says only basic attack/movement work in denial zone — shadow_strike may be blocked. Safe play: basic attack Snare for 1dmg, then move to (4,1) behind Snare or retreat to (4,2)/(4,3). At 1HP I need to survive. Attack Snare (adjacent, basic attack works in denial), then move to (4,2) to get distance.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Veil is critical and needs protection. I should stay put to keep fortify active and attack Warden, then use shield_wall south to block Warden's attacks from reaching Doc at (5,3). Actually shield_wall protects adjacent allies from a direction — Doc is not adjacent. Best play: attack Warden first, then shield_wall to protect any adjacent ally if needed. Since no ally is adjacent, I'll attack Warden and wait to maintain fortify.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 4/8 HP, and Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) to my north. I should attack Aegis since it's in range, then use shield_wall facing north to block incoming damage from Aegis next turn. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Veil is critical at (4,2) and in range. Doc is healthy at (5,3) and in range. I'm at (5,1). Veil is adjacent to me (distance 2), so pulse would hit both Veil and Doc if I move to (4,2) or stay close. Actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of me. From (5,1), Veil at (4,2) is distance 2 (not within 1 tile). From (5,2), Veil at (4,2) is distance sqrt(2)~1.4 - still not adjacent. Let me think about trap placement. My trap is at (3,1). Orders say control chokepoints between enemies and allies. Veil is critical - I should finish them with attack (range: adjacent only, dist=2 so out of attack range). I can attack with range 2. Wait - attack is adjacent only (range 1). Veil at (4,2) is distance 2 from me at (5,1). I can move to (4,1) to be adjacent to Veil at (4,2) and attack. Or use pulse from (5,2) - that would be within 1 tile of Doc at (5,3). From (5,2): Doc at (5,3) is dist 1 (hit), Veil at (4,2) is dist sqrt(2)~1.4 (not within 1). Best plan: move to (5,2) to be adjacent to Doc and closer to Veil, then pulse to hit Doc. Or move to (4,1) adjacent to Veil, attack to finish Veil. Move to (4,1): adjacent to Veil(4,2) - can attack. Also placing trap at (3,1) already exists. Let me move to (4,1) and attack Veil to eliminate the critical target.
  State: Warden 4/8, Snare 8/9, Aegis 7/8, Doc 15/16 | Dead: Ghost, Veil

### Turn 7 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(3,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded at (3,4) and needs a heal, but is 3 tiles away — not adjacent. I need to move closer. From (5,3) I can move to (4,4) which puts me at dist=1 from Aegis at (3,4), making them adjacent. Snare is at (4,1), dist=3 from me currently — moving to (4,4) keeps me at safe distance (dist=4 from Snare). After moving to (4,4), Aegis at (3,4) is adjacent, so I can use patch to heal them.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack Aegis to deal damage, then use shield_wall facing north to block incoming damage. Staying put preserves fortify.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded — attack to finish or weaken. I'm fortified so I want to stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Warden first, then use shield_wall facing South to protect Doc behind me if needed. Actually Doc is at (4,4) to my east, Warden is south at (3,3). I should attack Warden and hold position to maintain Fortify bonus.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Enemies Doc@(4,4) and Aegis@(3,4) are 3-4 tiles away. There's already a trap at (3,1). I should move closer and place a trap on a chokepoint between enemy positions and my ally Warden@(3,3). Moving to (4,3) puts me 1 tile from Warden and lets me threaten the area. Then place a trap at (3,2) to cover the corridor between enemies and Warden — if Aegis or Doc advance south through (3,3)→(3,2) they'll hit it.
  State: Warden 3/8, Snare 8/9, Aegis 7/8, Doc 15/16 | Dead: Ghost, Veil

### Turn 8 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone, so abilities are blocked anyway. Aegis is wounded at (3,4) but I can't heal. Snare is at (4,3) adjacent to me, blocking abilities. Best action: move away from Snare's denial zone to (4,5) to potentially use overclock next turn, staying near Aegis. Then attack Snare if possible, but abilities are blocked so I'll just reposition.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with both Aegis at (3,4) and Doc at (4,5) in range. Warden ally is at (3,3) wounded and needs protection. My traps are already at (3,1) and (3,2). I should pulse to hit both enemies since they're within range - but pulse only hits units within 1 tile, and both enemies are at distance 2. Better to place a trap to control the space between enemies and Warden. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to Doc at (4,5), enabling denial and setting up a pulse. From (4,4) I can pulse hitting Doc (dist=1) and potentially Aegis if they move. Let me move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Doc (denying abilities) then pulse to hit Doc and possibly Aegis.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 3HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction), facing Aegis directly north at (3,4) distance 1. I should stay put to keep Fortify active and attack Aegis. Snare is at (4,4) - I'm positioned between allies and the enemy front. Best play: attack Aegis while staying fortified, then use shield_wall facing north to protect against incoming attacks.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, holding position at (3,4). Warden is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded — I should attack to finish or weaken further. Snare's denial zone blocks my shield_wall, so only basic attack works. Attacking Warden is highest value since they're wounded. I'll stay put to maintain fortify bonus and attack Warden.
  State: Warden 2/8, Snare 8/9, Aegis 5/8, Doc 14/16 | Dead: Ghost, Veil

### Turn 9 — player
- **Doc** (medic): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Aegis is wounded at (3,4) dist=2, but I can't heal anyway. I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone, so overclock is blocked. Only basic attack or movement work. I should attack Snare (adjacent, dist=1) to deal damage and potentially move toward Aegis to stay close. Attack Snare first, then move to (3,5) to close distance to Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) at (3,4) with 5/8 HP. Warden is critical at (3,3) distance 1 — priority target to eliminate. Snare is adjacent at (4,4) with DENIAL active, blocking my abilities except basic attack. I cannot use shield_wall due to DENIAL. I should attack Warden to finish them off (critical HP). Moving would break fortify. Stay in place and attack Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/8 HP but fortified (50% damage reduction). Aegis is adjacent to my north at (3,4). I should attack Aegis since it's in range, and stay put to maintain Fortify passive. Attacking without moving keeps fortification active.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded - pulse will hit them for 1dmg and potentially Doc at dist=2 is outside pulse range (1 tile AoE). My Denial passive already blocks Aegis from using certain abilities. Warden is critical at (3,3) - I should protect them. Aegis at (3,4) is adjacent, so I can't place a trap there. I can pulse Aegis now for damage, then move to (4,5) or stay to maintain denial pressure. Actually, pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - that includes Aegis at (3,4) which is adjacent. Doc at (3,5) is dist=2 from me, outside pulse range. I'll pulse first to hit Aegis, then move to (4,5) to set up trap coverage on the north approach, keeping denial on Aegis.
  State: Warden 1/8, Snare 7/9, Aegis 3/8, Doc 14/16 | Dead: Ghost, Veil

### Turn 10 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → overclock(3,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Snare's denial zone blocks my abilities while adjacent. Aegis is critically wounded at 3/8 HP but I cannot heal. I should move away from Snare to escape denial zone, then use overclock on Aegis to give them extra actions. Moving to (2,4) gets me adjacent to Aegis at (3,4) and out of Snare's denial zone. From (2,4), I can overclock Aegis.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) and wounded - I should attack to finish them off. Staying in place preserves Fortify. Attack Aegis first, then wait to keep fortification active.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is critical and adjacent (dist=2), within attack range. I can pulse to hit Aegis for 1dmg which may finish them off at critical health. Warden is also nearby at (3,3) but they're an ally so I need to check - pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile. My position (4,5), Aegis at (3,4) is dist=2 so NOT within 1 tile of pulse. Let me reconsider. Pulse range is 1 tile AoE from my position. Aegis at dist=2 is out of pulse range. I could move closer to pulse Aegis, but Warden is critical at (3,3) - I don't want to pulse Warden. Best option: move to (3,5) to get adjacent to Aegis at (3,4), then attack for 1dmg to potentially finish critical Aegis. Or place a trap at (3,5) to block Doc's approach path. Actually, Aegis is critical - attack from (4,5) won't reach (dist=2, attack is adjacent only). Move to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (3,4) for an attack. This denies Aegis abilities and lets me attack.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical 1HP with fortify active (50% DR). I have 2 ability uses this turn (overclocked) but I'm in Snare's denial zone so only basic attacks work. Warden is adjacent to south (dist=1) and critical - I should attack to finish them. Snare is adjacent to north (dist=1) and healthy. With denial zone blocking abilities, I'll use both overclocked ability slots to attack both enemies. Attack Warden first to try to eliminate the critical target, then attack Snare.

- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → overclock(3,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at 1/8 HP and critically wounded, but I have 0 patch uses remaining. I cannot heal. Aegis is at (3,4) and Snare is at (3,5) - Snare is adjacent to Aegis. I can use overclock on Aegis to give them 2 abilities next turn, but I need to be adjacent to Aegis without being adjacent to Snare. Aegis is at (3,4), Snare at (3,5). If I move to (2,4) I'm already there - wait, I'm at (2,4). Moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to Aegis at (3,4) and NOT adjacent to Snare at (3,5) - distance from (3,3) to (3,5) is 2, safe. I can overclock Aegis from (3,3).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/8 HP but fortified (50% damage reduction) and have 2 ability uses. Snare is adjacent at (3,5) with DENIAL ACTIVE blocking my abilities — only basic attack and movement work. I need to attack Snare since it's adjacent and in range. With OVERCLOCKED I get 2 ability uses, but DENIAL blocks abilities so I should use basic attack twice if possible. Actually, DENIAL only blocks abilities — attack is a basic action. I'll attack Snare with both ability slots since attack is the only viable option. Wait — 'attack' is listed as an ability. If DENIAL blocks abilities, I may be limited. The warning says 'only basic attack/movement work' so attack should still work. I'll attack Snare twice using both ability uses.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(3,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) and critical - I'm already denying their abilities. Doc is at (3,3) healthy. I should pulse to hit Aegis (and possibly Doc if in range) since pulse hits all units within 1 tile. Aegis is adjacent so pulse will hit them. Doc at dist=2 is outside pulse range. After pulsing, I could move to maintain pressure or set a trap. Let me pulse first to hit critical Aegis, then move away to avoid retaliation.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Doc** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies visible to overclock. Snare is 2 tiles away at (4,4) - I must not move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. I'll hold position and wait.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is at (3,3) distance 2, within my attack and pulse range. I'm at 4/9 HP so I need to be careful. Doc is adjacent to me diagonally - my Denial passive blocks some abilities. I can pulse to hit Doc for 1 damage from current position, or attack for 1 damage. Traps are already at (3,1) and (3,2) blocking southern approach. I should place a trap to cut off Doc's movement options. Moving to (3,4) would put me adjacent to Doc, enabling attack and Denial suppression. Let me move to (3,4) to get adjacent to Doc (activating Denial to block their abilities) then attack for damage.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Doc** (medic): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Snare is adjacent at (3,4) — DENIAL zone is active, so overclock is blocked too. Only basic attack or movement work. Snare is wounded, so I can attack for chip damage. No allies to support right now. I'll attack Snare and wait.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive blocks their heal abilities. I'm at 3/9 HP and slowed. I should pulse Doc for 1 damage since they're within 1 tile, and I can't place traps while adjacent to an enemy. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - just Doc here. Then I could move away or stay to maintain denial pressure. Moving to (4,4) keeps me close enough to deny but gives me some flexibility. Actually, staying adjacent maximizes denial. Let me pulse first then reposition to (4,3) to maintain adjacency and denial while being slightly less predictable.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Doc** (medic): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I'm adjacent to Snare's DENIAL zone, which blocks abilities other than basic attack and movement. No allies visible to overclock. Snare is wounded and adjacent — I can attack. But orders say stay adjacent to most threatened ally and support. With no heals and abilities blocked by denial, I should attack Snare or reposition. Attacking the wounded enemy is my best option.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (3,3). My Denial passive blocks their abilities. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. I can't place traps while adjacent to an enemy. Best play: pulse Doc for 1dmg (hits all within 1 tile), then move away to safety. Pulse targets my own position as AoE center.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Doc** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch unavailable (0 uses left). No allies visible to overclock. Snare is at (5,4) distance 3 — I must avoid moving adjacent. I'll hold position or reposition slightly to stay available for support while keeping distance from Snare.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP, low health. Doc is at (3,3) distance 3, out of range. Traps are at (3,1) and (3,2) already covering that area. I should move closer to place a trap in Doc's path. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer, then I can place a trap at (4,3) or (3,4) to threaten Doc's movement. Actually, moving to (4,3) puts me at distance 2 from Doc and I could trap (3,3) area. But I'm at 2HP so I need to be cautious. Move to (4,4) and place trap at (3,4) to create a chokepoint between Doc and my position.

  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies are visible to overclock. Snare is at (4,4) critical and 2 tiles away — I must not move adjacent (which would block my abilities). I should stay at current position or reposition safely. Since I have no allies adjacent and patch is gone, I'll wait in place to maintain positioning.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with only 2HP - very low health. Doc is at (3,3) at distance 2, which is in my range. I have a trap at (3,4) already. Doc is adjacent to my trap at (3,4). I should use pulse to hit Doc for 1 damage since they're within 1 tile (dist=2, but pulse range is 1 tile AoE... wait, Doc is at dist=2 so outside pulse range). Doc is at (3,3), I'm at (4,4) - that's distance 2, so pulse won't reach. I could place a trap to block Doc's path, or move to get adjacent for pulse. Moving to (3,4) would put me adjacent to Doc at (3,3) enabling pulse, but (3,4) already has a trap there - can't place there. Moving to (4,3) keeps distance. I'm very low HP so I should be cautious. Let me move to (5,4) to reposition away from danger, then place a trap at (3,4) - wait, trap already there. Place trap at (4,3) to cut off Doc's movement south.

- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP, very low. Doc is at (3,3) heading south. Traps already at (3,1),(3,2),(3,4),(4,3). I need to control Doc's path. Moving to (3,4) is occupied by a trap. I can move to (4,3) but that's also a trap. Valid moves: (3,4),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,2),(5,3),(5,5). I should place a trap to intercept Doc's southward movement. Move to (4,4) to get closer, then place trap at (3,3) area... wait, Doc is at (3,3). I can place trap on empty tiles within range 2. From (4,4), I can reach (3,3) but Doc is there. Place trap at (4,3)? Already trapped. Let me move to (4,5) to stay safe and place trap at (3,4) - but that's already trapped. From (4,5), trap range is 2, so I can reach (3,4)[trapped],(3,5),(2,5),(4,3)[trapped]. Place trap at (3,5) to catch Doc moving south-east. Actually Doc is heading S, so trap at (3,2) would be good but that's already trapped. Move to (4,4) and trap (3,5) to block Doc's escape routes.

- **Doc** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies visible to overclock. Snare is at (4,4), critical and 2 tiles away - I must not move adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. I'll wait in place since there's nothing productive to do without heal uses and no visible allies to support.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 2HP - critically low. Doc is at (3,3) distance 2, healthy. I need to stay alive. I'm adjacent to Doc (dist=2, within denial range at dist=1? No, denial is adjacent=dist1). Doc is dist=2 so not in denial range yet. I have traps at (3,4) already. I should attack Doc since they're in range (dist=2, my range is 2). But I only have 2HP - need to be careful. I could pulse Doc (within 1 tile AoE? Doc is at dist=2, pulse range is 1 tile AoE so needs to be within 1 tile - Doc is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach). Attack is range adjacent only (dist=1). Doc is dist=2 so attack won't reach either. I can place a trap - but (3,4) already has a trap. Valid moves include (3,5), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) etc. I should move away to survive since I can't effectively attack at dist=2 with my abilities except... wait, my range is 2 for basic attack? No - attack is adjacent only per the rules. Pulse is 1 tile AoE. So at dist=2 I can't hit Doc with attack or pulse. I should place a trap on Doc's likely path or move to safety. Move to (5,5) to get distance, then place a trap on (4,4) to deny Doc's advance path.

- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies are adjacent to me currently. Snare is at (5,5), critical but dist=4. I should move closer to the action and use overclock if I can find an ally to buff. Since no allies are visible adjacent, I'll move toward the enemy to position better, then wait or overclock if adjacent to an ally.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 2HP, very low health. Doc is adjacent at (4,4) distance 2, within attack range. I need to deal damage while staying alive. I can attack Doc for 1dmg. Trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy - Doc is at dist 2 so trap should be usable. I should attack Doc and place a trap to threaten their movement. Valid moves include (3,5),(4,5),(5,3),(5,4). If I move to (4,5), I'd be adjacent to Doc at (4,4) - that enables attack but exposes me. Better to attack from current position (dist 2, range 2) then place trap at (3,5) to control movement corridor.

  💭 Round 20, final round. Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Snare is critical at (5,5), distance 2 — cannot move adjacent or abilities get blocked. No allies listed nearby to overclock. I should stay safe and wait — moving toward Snare risks adjacency and ability denial. Best to hold position at (4,4).

  💭 Round 20, 2HP remaining. Doc is at (4,4) dist=2, in range. I'm at (5,5). I should attack Doc to deal damage. I can also try to move to maintain pressure. Attack first since Doc is in range at dist=2. Then move to (4,5) to stay adjacent and keep denial active, blocking Doc's abilities next turn.
