## Squads
### Player
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Patch** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
### Opponent
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(2,1) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist=5, need ≤4). I need to advance to get within scan range of Veil or Patch. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer but still dist=3 to Veil at (2,1) — within scan range. Let me move south toward enemies. From (3,5), moving to (3,2) puts me at dist=3 from Veil and dist=3 from Patch. I can then scan Veil to track the specter.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then move toward Insight at (3,2) facing S. Behind tile is (3,3) which is reachable. Cloaked approach sets up breach or shadow_strike next round.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded at 3/4 HP but is 4 tiles away - out of reach this turn. Insight is adjacent (dist=2) and is an enemy oracle that could be dangerous. Rampart is at full HP, no healing needed. I should move toward Veil to close distance for a heal next turn, while avoiding getting too close to enemies. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Veil (dist=2) and keeps me away from Insight at (3,2). I'll wait as second action.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is in range at dist=3 and is a high-value target per orders. I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. Firing without moving gives full 2dmg. I'll shoot Patch first, then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 Patch (enemy medic) is adjacent at (3,3) - prime attack target. Orders say attack when possible. I'll attack Patch first, then set up shield_wall facing South to protect allies from Rampart's advance.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,0) N ✓
  💭 Orders say push forward aggressively. Insight is at (3,2) dist=2, enemies cluster to north. Move to (3,1) to advance toward Insight. No enemies in melee range yet, so shield_wall facing N toward enemy cluster to protect allies Veil and Patch behind me.
  State: Rampart 8/8, Veil 3/4, Patch 15/16, Warden 8/8, Insight 6/6, Deadeye 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm surrounded by enemies — Patch (medic) at (3,3) dist=1 and Rampart (sentinel) at (3,1) dist=1. I need to get out of this dangerous position first. Veil is cloaked nearby at (2,3) — I can't see them but foresight showed them moving there. I should move away from the sandwich and scan Patch to get intel and deal damage. Moving to (2,2) gets me away from both enemies while keeping scan range on priority targets. Then scan Patch to reveal their prompt — medics are high-value scan targets.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Insight is adjacent (2,2) facing W, so I can move to (3,2) to get behind them, then use breach to control them next turn. That's high value — breach an oracle to disrupt enemy coordination. Move to (3,2) first (behind Insight, adjacent), then breach.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(3,2) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded at (3,2) with 3/4 HP and is adjacent to me at dist=1... wait, let me check. I'm at (3,3), Veil is at (3,2) - that's distance 1, adjacent. I can patch Veil immediately. Warden is at (3,4) which is also adjacent to me - this blocks patch/overclock only if Warden is a Vector class. Warden is a sentinel, not a Vector, so no blocking. I'll patch Veil first (they're adjacent at (3,2)), then move to stay behind the frontliner. Rampart is at (3,1) as my frontliner sentinel. Moving to (3,2) after Veil moves would put me between them, but Veil is specter. I should patch Veil then position safely.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-5, max range 2). I need to close distance to get Patch (medic, high priority) in range. Moving to (5,2) gets me closer. From (5,2), Patch at (2,3) is still dist 4 — still out of range. Best I can do is move toward the cluster. Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist 3 from Veil and Patch — still out of range but closer. No ability possible this turn. Move closer and wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Enemies are clustered at (3,2), (2,3), (3,1). Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Move to (3,3) to close distance — puts me adjacent to Veil at (3,2) and Patch at (2,3). Then shield_wall facing S toward the enemy cluster (Rampart is at (3,1), south of me after moving to (3,3)). This protects allies from the southern threat while I'm in position to attack next turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Orders are to push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. Moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to Warden, but that's only dist 2 away so I need to move. Best move is to (3,2) - advances toward the enemy cluster (Warden at 3,3, Insight at 2,2) and puts me adjacent to Warden for attack. After moving I lose Fortify, but I can shield_wall facing North toward the enemy cluster to protect Veil who's also at (3,2)... wait, Veil is at (3,2) so I'd occupy same space. Move to (4,2) instead - puts me dist 1 from Warden and gives flanking angle on Deadeye at (4,3). From (4,2) I can attack Warden or use shield_wall N facing the cluster. Actually (3,2) is occupied by Veil. Valid moves show (4,2) is available. Move to (4,2): dist to Warden becomes 1 (adjacent), can attack. Shield_wall facing N to cover against Deadeye at (4,3) who is directly north.
  State: Rampart 8/8, Veil 4/4, Patch 14/16, Warden 8/8, Insight 6/6, Deadeye 3/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Patch** (medic): attack(2,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with two enemies adjacent: Warden at (3,3) and Insight at (2,2). My Warning says patch/overclock are blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector - but these are sentinel and oracle, not Vector. Both allies are at full HP so no healing needed. I should attack an adjacent enemy to deal damage, then move away to safer ground. Insight at (2,2) is adjacent - attacking it deals 1 damage. Then I can move west to (1,3) to create distance from enemies.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(2,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Insight (oracle) at (3,2) while Insight faces W. Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining), so I can't use it. Shadow_strike works adjacent and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked. I can use regular attack or shadow_strike on Insight. Shadow_strike deals 1 dmg and I'm adjacent. Insight is healthy and high-value (oracle). Warden is also adjacent at (3,3) but I'm not behind them. Best play: shadow_strike Insight for 1 damage (keeps any cloak if I had it), then move to (3,4) to get behind Warden for next turn when breach comes off cooldown.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge, no abilities. Current position (2,2). Allies at (3,3) and (4,3). Moving toward an edge away from allies. (0,2) moves west toward the edge and away from allies clustered to the east.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. Veil is at dist=2 and in range. Orders say maintain distance and prioritize medics, but Patch is out of range at dist=3. Veil (specter) is a high-value target at dist=2. I should move away from Rampart first to enable precision_shot, then use it on Veil. Moving to (5,4) increases distance from Rampart and keeps Veil in range (dist would be ~2 from (5,4) to (3,4)).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (4,2) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in melee range yet. Warden is closest at dist=2 to my NW at (3,3). Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. If I move to (4,3) I get closer to Warden and can shield_wall N to protect allies from that direction. Moving to (4,3) puts Warden at dist=1 (adjacent), allowing attack next. Actually moving to (3,3) would be adjacent to Warden but that's Warden's position. Move to (4,3) first, then shield_wall facing N toward Warden/enemy cluster.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with two enemies adjacent: Rampart at (4,3) and Veil at (3,4). Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Both enemies are to my N/E. If I stay put I keep fortify bonus. I should shield_wall facing East to protect against Rampart, then attack Veil or Rampart. Actually, I can do shield_wall first facing E to block Rampart, then attack Veil to the N. Wait - Veil is at (3,4) which is North of me. Rampart is at (4,3) which is East. I'll attack Rampart (East, adjacent) first, then shield_wall facing N to block Veil's likely attack direction. Actually orders say shield_wall facing enemy cluster - both are NE. I'll attack Rampart since it's the tank threat, then shield_wall East to cover that direction.
  State: Rampart 7/8, Veil 3/4, Patch 14/16, Warden 8/8, Insight 4/6, Deadeye 3/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → patch(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both allies are wounded but neither is adjacent to me (dist=3 each). I need to move toward one to heal them. Veil the specter is at (3,4) and Rampart the sentinel is at (4,3). Moving to (2,4) gets me closer but still not adjacent to either. Moving to (3,2) is a valid tile and puts me adjacent to Warden enemy sentinel - bad idea. Let me check: from (1,3) with mv3, I can reach (2,4) which is dist=1 from Veil at (3,4) - so adjacent! That lets me patch Veil. Also need to watch Insight oracle at (0,2) which is dangerous nearby. Moving to (2,4) keeps me away from Insight and adjacent to Veil for healing.
- **Veil** (specter): breach(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent (3,3) facing S, and I'm already behind them at (3,4). Breach cooldown is ready and this is a high-value disruption — making Warden obey me next turn could neutralize their sentinel. After breach, I can shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge, no abilities. I'm at (0,2) on the west edge already. Allies are at (3,3) and (5,4). Moving south toward (0,0) corner keeps me on the edge and away from allies.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Priority target is Patch (medic) at (2,4), dist 3 — out of range from current position. Veil (specter) is at (2,4) dist 2, in range. Orders say medics first. I need to close distance to reach Patch, but moving would reduce precision_shot to 1dmg. Veil is also high value at dist 2. If I move to (4,4), Patch moves to dist 2 from there — but I'd still be adjacent to Veil potentially. Let me check: from (4,4), Patch at (2,4) is dist 2, in range. Moving first then using precision_shot gives 1dmg due to movement penalty. Better to shoot first, then move. Shoot Patch with precision_shot from current pos — but Patch is dist 3, out of range (range ≤2). So I can't hit Patch without moving. Veil is dist 2, in range, healthy. Shoot Veil first (in range, no move penalty = 2dmg), then move toward Patch for next turn. That's the best play.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Insight's position at (0,0). I'm at (3,3). Moving toward (0,0) means going southwest. Valid moves include (2,3) and (2,2) which move me closer to Insight. I should also use my attack on Rampart or Veil before moving, but orders prioritize movement. Actually, orders say move away from allies - Deadeye is at (4,4) and Insight at (0,0). Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to Insight and away from Deadeye. I can attack Rampart first since it's adjacent, then move. Attack Rampart at (4,3) first, then move to (2,3).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Deadeye is adjacent at (4,4) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so I shouldn't move (keeps 50% damage reduction). After attacking, use shield_wall facing North to protect allies Veil and Patch behind me from Deadeye's potential counterattack.
  State: Rampart 6/8, Veil 3/4, Patch 14/16, Warden 7/8, Insight 4/6, Deadeye 2/4

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is adjacent and wounded — shadow_strike will finish them off while keeping cloak active. I'm not cloaked currently, so I'll use shadow_strike as a regular attack on the adjacent wounded Deadeye to eliminate them. Actually, shadow_strike requires adjacency and I'm at (3,4), Deadeye at (4,4) — that's adjacent. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and Deadeye is wounded, so this should finish them. After the kill, I can move to (3,3) which is behind Warden and adjacent — setting up a shadow_strike next round.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge, no abilities. I'm at (0,0) which is already a corner. Allies are at (2,3) and (4,4). Moving to (3,0) takes me along the bottom edge, away from allies. That's my best move within range 3.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) is critically wounded at 3HP adjacent at dist=2, and I have 1 heal left. Warden is adjacent to me at (2,3) which blocks patch/overclock if they count as adjacent enemy. Wait - Warden is at (2,3) and I'm at (2,4), so Warden IS adjacent to me, which blocks patch and overclock. I need to move away from Warden first to use patch. Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist=1 from Veil at (3,3) and dist=1 from Warden - still adjacent to Warden. Moving to (1,4) gets me away from Warden (dist=2) but farther from Veil. Moving to (3,5) - Warden at (2,3) would be dist=3, not adjacent. From (3,5) Veil at (3,3) is dist=2, not adjacent for patch. Moving to (3,4): I'm at (3,4), Warden at (2,3) is dist=2 (not adjacent!), Veil at (3,3) is dist=1 (adjacent - can patch!). This works. Move to (3,4) then patch Veil at (3,3).
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with enemies adjacent - Rampart at dist=1 and Patch(medic) at dist=1. Priority is to eliminate the medic first per orders, but precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy (Rampart is adjacent). I need to move to create distance. Moving to (5,5) gets me away from Rampart and Patch. From (5,5), Patch at (3,4) would be dist=sqrt(4+1)~2.24 - out of range 2. Veil at (3,3) would be dist=sqrt(4+4)~2.83 - out of range. Let me check (5,4): Patch at (3,4) is dist=2, in range. Rampart at (4,3) is dist=sqrt(1+1)~1.41 - still adjacent-ish but not adjacent. From (5,4), no enemy is directly adjacent so precision_shot should work. Target Patch(medic) at (3,4) from (5,4): dist=2, in range, no adjacency block. But I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg. Still worth it to hit the medic.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Insight's position at (3,0). I'm at (2,3). Insight is at (3,0) to the southeast. Moving toward (3,2) gets me closer to Insight while also being a valid move. I should not attack since orders are to reposition. I'll move to (3,2) which is in my valid moves and heads toward Insight.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is critical at dist=2 to my SE at (5,4). If I move to (5,3) I'll be adjacent and can attack. Warden is at (3,2) dist=2, not adjacent. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. Moving to (5,3) puts me adjacent to Deadeye for a kill, though I lose fortify. Alternatively, stay fortified and shield_wall toward Deadeye's direction. But orders say attack when possible and push forward - Deadeye is critical so one hit should finish them. Move to (5,3) then attack Deadeye at (5,4).
  State: Rampart 6/8, Veil 4/4, Patch 13/16, Warden 7/8, Insight 4/6 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,1) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is within scan range at dist 3, but I already have Veil's prompt. Patch is at dist 4 — exactly at range limit. Foresight shows Patch moved to (3,4) last turn, currently there. Let me check: scan range is ≤4 tiles. Patch is at dist 4 from current position (3,0) — that's exactly 4, so within range. I should scan Patch to deal 1 damage and get their prompt confirmed. Then I can move to a safer position or stay. Actually I already know Patch's prompt from previous scan. Rampart is out of range at dist 5. Veil is already scanned. My best play: scan Veil again to deal 1 damage (since they're healthy and dangerous with shadow_strike), then move to reposition. Or scan Patch for 1 damage. Veil is the bigger threat — shadow_strike from cloak is dangerous. Dealing 1 damage to Veil is useful. Move first to (4,1) to stay safe and maintain range options, then scan Veil at (3,3) — dist from (4,1) to (3,3) = |4-3|+|1-3| = 1+2 = 3, still in range. This keeps me safe while dealing damage.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(3,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil the specter is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded at 3/4 HP. I can overclock Veil to give them 2 abilities next turn — useful since specter is in action order. I need to check if Warden at (3,2) is adjacent to me — dist=2 so not adjacent, overclock is not blocked. Move to (3,3) first? No, Veil is at (3,3) so I can't move there. I'm at (3,4), Veil is at (3,3) — they are adjacent! I can overclock them now from my current position. After overclock, I should reposition safely. Move to (4,4) or (4,5) to stay back while staying near allies.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Warden (dist=1, behind=true) and I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Warden is adjacent at (3,2). I'll use shadow_strike twice to deal 2 damage while staying cloaked (shadow_strike doesn't break cloak). This maximizes damage output this turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Insight's position at (4,1). I'm at (3,2), Insight is at (4,1). Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Insight and away from current position. Then I can attack Veil who is adjacent at (3,3) — but wait, orders say move toward Insight, not attack. I should prioritize the orders. Moving to (4,2) first, then (4,3) would take me further from Insight. Best single move toward (4,1) from (3,2) is (4,2) — that's 1 step closer. I lose fortify by moving. Veil is adjacent now but orders say move. I'll move to (4,2) to approach Insight, then attack Veil if still in range — but Veil is at (3,3), from (4,2) dist=2, out of melee range. So second action: wait.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (5,3) with 6/8 HP. Warden is at (4,2) dist=2, Insight at (4,1) dist=3. Orders say push forward aggressively. If I move to (4,3) I'll be adjacent to Warden at (4,2) and can attack. That's the aggressive push. After moving I lose fortify but I can attack Warden. Shield_wall facing S would protect against Insight cluster below.
  State: Rampart 6/8, Veil 3/4, Patch 13/16, Warden 4/8, Insight 4/6 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 7 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (4,2) facing E — I'm already behind them (west side). Move to (3,2) to get adjacent and behind, then shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Rampart is adjacent at (4,3) and wounded at 6/8 HP. I can overclock Rampart to give them 2 abilities next turn, which helps our frontliner apply pressure. Warden is wounded at dist=2, so I stay put and overclock Rampart.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(4,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (4,3) dist=2 and is attacking Warden. Veil and Patch are already scanned. I should scan Rampart to get its prompt and deal 1 damage. Then recalibrate Warden at (4,2) which is adjacent to me — I can warn Warden about Rampart's attack pattern and Veil's shadow_strike threat.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 3/8 HP, fortified (50% damage reduction). Rampart is adjacent at (4,3) to my north, Veil is adjacent at (3,2) to my west. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I should attack Rampart (primary threat attacking me), then shield_wall facing North to block Rampart's incoming damage while keeping fortify active by not moving.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction and overclocked (2 ability uses). Warden is adjacent at (4,2) and wounded — perfect target. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Warden first, then shield_wall facing South to protect against Warden/Insight cluster below me. No need to move — staying put keeps Fortify active.
  State: Rampart 4/8, Veil 3/4, Patch 13/16, Warden 2/8, Insight 4/6 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 8 — player
- **Veil** (specter): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 Warden is at critical HP and adjacent to me at (4,2). I'm already behind Warden (behind tiles include my current position (3,2)). Shadow_strike deals 1 damage while keeping cloak active — but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack will finish off the critical Warden. After that, I can move toward Insight at (4,1) to threaten them next turn. Insight is healthy so I won't be able to finish them this turn, but positioning matters.
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(4,2) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Foresight reveals Veil will move to (3,2) and shadow_strike Warden at (4,2) — this is critical. Warden is already critical HP. I need to warn Warden. Veil is adjacent to me at (4,0), so scan is blocked. I can recalibrate Warden at (4,2) who is adjacent to warn them about the incoming shadow_strike from Veil coming from (3,2). Then I should move away from Veil to avoid being adjacent next turn. Moving to (3,1) gets me away from Veil while keeping range options open.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Rampart is at 4/8 HP adjacent to me at (4,3), and Warden is critical at (4,2) just beyond Rampart. I should overclock Rampart so they can act twice next turn - they're the frontliner holding back the critical Warden. I'm already adjacent to Rampart at (4,3). After overclocking, I should reposition to stay safe while keeping Rampart buffed.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✗ No unit at target
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (4,2) and critical — attack to finish it. I'm fortified so staying put keeps 50% damage reduction. With OVERCLOCKED I get 2 ability uses. Attack Warden twice to eliminate it.
  State: Rampart 4/8, Veil 3/4, Patch 13/16, Insight 4/6 | Dead: Warden, Deadeye

### Turn 9 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (3,1) facing W, and I'm behind them from (4,1). I can move to (4,1) which is adjacent and behind, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This is the optimal play.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → overclock(4,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Rampart is at (4,3) with 4/8 HP and needs help, but I can't heal. I should move toward Rampart to get adjacent and use overclock to give them 2 abilities next turn — that could help them survive or deal more damage. From (5,4), moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (4,3). Then I can overclock Rampart.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,1) and already scanned — I know their prompt. Foresight shows Veil moved to (4,0) last turn, now at (4,1) facing N. Veil will try to shadow_strike me since I'm adjacent. I need to escape adjacency to avoid that attack and stay safe. Move away from Veil first — go to (2,1) to break adjacency. Then I can recalibrate Patch or scan is blocked when adjacent to Veil anyway. After moving to (2,1), I'm no longer adjacent to Veil. All enemy prompts are known. Best use now: recalibrate an ally. Patch is at (4,4), dist 4 — out of recalibrate range (adjacent only). I should recalibrate someone adjacent. No allies are adjacent currently. Wait as second action.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified and overclocked with 2 ability uses. Insight is at (2,1), distance 4, out of range. Orders say push forward aggressively. I should move west toward Insight. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer. No enemies adjacent so attack isn't possible. I'll use shield_wall facing W toward the enemy, then use the second ability for another shield_wall or just move closer. Best: move to (2,3) to close distance — wait, (2,3) is valid. That puts me at dist 2 from Insight at (2,1). Then shield_wall facing N (toward Insight direction from there). Actually Insight is at (2,1) which is north of (2,3). Shield_wall facing N protects allies to my north.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,1) ✓
  💭 Insight is wounded and 2 tiles away at (2,1). I can move to (3,1) which is directly behind Insight (they face W, so east side is behind). From (3,1) I'll be adjacent and can use shadow_strike which doesn't break cloak — but I'm not cloaked. So I'll just move to (3,1) and shadow_strike for 1 damage. This could finish off a wounded oracle.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP with Veil adjacent at (3,1) — extremely dangerous. Foresight shows Veil moved to (4,1) last turn and shadow_struck back to (3,1), so Veil is right next to me and likely to strike again. I need to escape. Move away from Veil first — go to (0,1) or (1,3) to create distance. Then I can recalibrate an ally or scan. Best move: go to (0,2) to escape Veil's adjacency. Then recalibrate Patch isn't possible (out of range). I already have all enemy prompts scanned. I should recalibrate an ally if adjacent — no allies are adjacent. Best play: move to (1,3) to escape Veil, then wait or scan Rampart isn't useful (already scanned). Actually move to (0,2) to maximize distance from Veil at (3,1). Then wait since no allies adjacent for recalibrate and all enemies already scanned.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Rampart is at (2,3) with 4/8 HP, wounded and needs support. I'm at (4,4) with speed 3. I should move toward Rampart to get adjacent for overclock. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (2,3). Then I can overclock Rampart to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could help them hold the line.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 4/8 HP, fortified and overclocked (2 ability uses). Insight is at (0,2), distance 3, wounded. Orders say push forward aggressively. I should move toward Insight to close distance. Moving to (1,3) puts me at distance 2 from Insight. I have 2 ability uses due to overclocked. Shield_wall facing W to protect allies from Insight, and potentially use second ability for another shield_wall or wait for attack next turn. Allies Veil is at (3,1) and Patch at (2,4) - both healthy. Moving west toward Insight while maintaining fortify isn't possible (moving breaks fortify). Since I'm at 4HP and orders say push forward, I'll move to (1,3) to get closer, then shield_wall facing W toward Insight to protect the line.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP — very low. Veil is about to shadow_strike at (2,1) next turn, which is dangerous but not adjacent to me. Rampart is at (1,3), dist 2 — within scan range (≤4). I've already scanned all enemies so no new intel needed. Patch is overclocking someone and Rampart is shield_walling. I should retreat to safety — move away from Veil's approach vector. Moving to (0,4) puts distance from Veil at (3,1). Actually I should move somewhere safe. Veil will be at (2,1) after move, then shadow_strike (2,1) — that's not adjacent to me wherever I go on the left edge. Best play: move to (0,4) to get further from Veil's path, then wait. I have all prompts already, so recalibrate could help an ally. Patch is overclocking — I could recalibrate Patch to stop wasting overclock on Rampart's target. But recalibrate is adjacent only and no ally is adjacent. Best: move to safety (0,4 or 0,5) and wait.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). Insight is at (0,4) distance 6, out of range. No enemies are adjacent. I should close the gap toward Insight who is wounded. Moving toward (0,4) - max move is 3 tiles. Best path: move to (1,1) then toward (0,4) next turn, or move to (0,1) to get closer. Actually moving to (1,4) would be ideal but that's only reachable if path allows - checking valid moves: (2,3) is reachable at dist 2, (3,4) at dist 3. I'll move to (2,3) to close distance toward Insight at (0,4). No ability targets available, so wait as second action.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → overclock(1,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Rampart is critically wounded at 4/8 HP but is 2 tiles away. Veil is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded at 3/4 HP. I should move toward Rampart to potentially overclock them, but first I need to check adjacency. Moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (1,3) and I can overclock them to help them act twice next turn. Veil is also wounded but overclock on Rampart (the frontliner sentinel) is higher priority per orders.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,3) ✓ → attack(0,4) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (0,4), distance 2 to my north-west. I need to close in to attack. Moving to (0,3) puts me adjacent to Insight at (0,4). With OVERCLOCKED I get 2 ability uses. After moving to (0,3), I can attack Insight and also use shield_wall facing N to protect allies from any northern threats.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is at (0,4) critical health, dist 3. Breach unavailable. I need to close distance to use shadow_strike. Moving to (1,4) would put me adjacent to Insight at (0,4). Valid moves include (1,5) and others. Let me check: (1,4) is where Patch is, can't end there. I can move to (1,5) — that's adjacent to Insight at (0,4)? No, (1,5) is distance 2 from (0,4). Actually (0,4) neighbors are (0,3),(0,5),(1,4). I'm at (2,3). I can move to (1,4) but Patch is there. Move to (1,3) — adjacent to (0,3) where Rampart is, not adjacent to Insight. Best approach: move to (1,5) puts me at dist sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 from Insight, but shadow_strike requires adjacent only. I need to be at (0,3),(0,5),(1,4) to be adjacent to Insight at (0,4). (0,3) is where Rampart is. (0,5) — is that a valid move? It's not in my valid tiles list. (1,4) is valid but Patch is there. I cannot reach adjacent to Insight this turn without occupying a taken tile. Move to (1,5) to get closer, then next turn can reach (0,4) adjacency.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → overclock(1,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is exhausted (0/3). Rampart is critically wounded at (0,3) dist=2, can't reach to heal anyway. Veil is wounded at (1,5) dist=1 but no heals left. Enemy Insight is adjacent at (0,4) — this blocks overclock if I stay here. I need to move away from Insight to use overclock on Veil. Moving to (2,5) gets me away from Insight and adjacent to Veil at (1,5), allowing overclock. Overclock on Veil (specter) gives them 2 abilities next turn which could be very impactful.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(1,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,4) with 1HP — critically low. Rampart is adjacent at (0,3) and attacked me last turn. I need to survive. Foresight shows Veil moved to (2,3) and Patch moved to (1,4) with overclock to (1,3) — enemies are closing in. My priority: move away from Rampart to avoid another attack, then use scan on Veil to track them (specters go invisible). Moving to (1,4) puts me next to where Patch was, but Foresight shows Patch moved to (1,4)... wait, those are last turn's moves shown as foresight. Current positions: Rampart@(0,3), Veil@(1,5), Patch@(2,5). I should move to (3,4) to escape Rampart's range while staying in scan range of enemies. From (3,4), Veil at (1,5) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, within range 4. Scan Veil to track after cloak.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) E ✓
  💭 Insight is at (3,4), distance 4 — out of attack range. Orders say push forward aggressively. I'm at (0,3) with 4HP, fortified. Moving toward Insight means losing fortify bonus, but orders are clear: push forward. Best move is toward (2,3) to close distance to 2 from Insight. Still can't attack after move. Shield_wall facing E toward enemy cluster makes sense as second action to protect allies.
