Moving to (2,5) keeps distance. Best play: move toward Shade to get adjacent for pulse, but (3,4) has a trap. I could move to (3,5) then pulse down toward (3,3)? No, pulse is 1-tile AoE from my position. From (3,5), Shade at (3,3) is dist=2 — still not in pulse range. I can't get adjacent to Shade without stepping on trap at (3,4). Place trap at (4,4) to block Doc/Shade advance corridor, then pulse from current — but Shade isn't within 1 tile. Best: place trap at (4,4) to block the approach, then wait since I can't reach Shade safely.",
