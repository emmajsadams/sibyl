## Squads
### Player
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(2,0) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-7, need ≤4). Closest is Bastion at (2,0) dist 5. I need to move south to close range. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist 3 from Bastion — within scan range. Then I can scan Bastion to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and TIP. Then move north toward enemy lines. Watcher at (2,2) is closest and most dangerous (oracle, high speed). Moving to (0,3) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying off the main approach path.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (1,4). Nearest enemy is Bastion at dist=5, Bolt at dist=7. My range is 2. I need to close distance. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer while staying away from adjacency. Still won't be in range this turn, so I'll move as far south as possible toward enemies. Best move tile toward enemies is (2,3) or (1,2) - let me go (1,2) to advance toward Bastion at (2,0). Still out of range after moving, so second action is wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-5, max range 2). Need to advance to get Weaver (vector) or Watcher (oracle) in range. Moving to (4,2) closes distance to Weaver at (4,4) to dist=2, putting them in precision_shot range. No enemies adjacent so precision_shot won't be blocked.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bolt(enemy striker) is at (4,2), distance 2 - within my range. I'm at (4,4). I should place a trap between us or on a likely approach path. Bolt is directly south at (4,2), likely moving north toward our backline. I'll place a trap at (4,3) to catch Bolt if it advances, then hold position to use Denial if it gets adjacent.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (2,2), distance 2 from my position (2,0). Moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent to Watcher and closes the front line. From (2,1) I can attack Watcher directly.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Bastion 7/8, Bolt 4/4, Bolt 4/4, Weaver 8/9, Watcher 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → breach(1,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I'm behind Bolt at (1,2) — tile (1,3) is adjacent, behind, and reachable. I should move to (1,3) and use breach on Bolt to take control. Watcher at (2,2) is also reachable from behind via (2,3), but Bolt is closer and breach is ready. Breaching Bolt removes a striker from the enemy team's control next turn. Save shadow_strike for later when cloak may be gone.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent (dist=1) and Foresight shows it will attack me at (2,2). I need to move away first, then scan Ghost whose prompt is unknown. Ghost cloaked last turn and is now at (1,3) — scanning it would reveal its prompt. Move to (3,2) to increase distance from Bastion while keeping Ghost and Bolt in scan range. Then scan Ghost at (1,3) — dist from (3,2) is 2, within range.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (1,3) - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I should move to (2,2) per orders (pressures Watcher position), which puts me at dist=1 from Ghost still but moving away, and then use suppressing_fire or attack on Ghost. Actually moving to (2,2) puts me dist=1 from Ghost at (1,3). After moving I can attack Ghost with basic attack (adjacent) or use suppressing_fire. Wait - after moving to (2,2), Ghost at (1,3) is sqrt(1+1)=1.4 tiles away, not adjacent. Precision_shot requires LoS and range≤2, dist=1.4 so in range. But did I move? Yes, so precision_shot does 1dmg. Better: move to (2,2), then precision_shot Ghost for 1dmg (moved penalty). Or attack isn't possible since not adjacent after move. suppressing_fire on Ghost from (2,2) targeting (1,3) for 1dmg and slow. Let me use precision_shot on Ghost after moving to (2,2).
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is adjacent at dist=1, blocking precision_shot isn't an issue since that's only blocked by vectors. Weaver (vector) is at dist=2 — not adjacent, so precision_shot is still usable. Priority targets: oracles are high-value (likely support). Watcher is at (3,2) dist=1 — I can use precision_shot on Watcher for 2dmg. I haven't moved yet so no penalty. After shooting, I should reposition to maintain distance from Weaver who will move next turn.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(5,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4), enemies approaching from south/southeast. Enemy Bolt is at (5,2) dist=3, moving toward our backline. There's already a trap at (4,3). I should place another trap to block the path enemies must use to reach our allies at (2,2) and (3,2). Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to deny abilities and lets me place a trap at a key chokepoint like (3,2) or intercept routes. Better: move to (4,2) to get closer to enemy Bolt and threaten with pulse, or place trap at (5,3) to catch Bolt moving north. I'll trap (5,3) - a likely path for the enemy Bolt coming from (5,2), then move to stay at medium range.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Bolt is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack the adjacent Bolt first, then stay put to keep fortify active. Moving would lose fortify bonus and I'm already on the front line.
  State: Ghost 2/4, Bastion 7/8, Bolt 4/4, Bolt 3/4, Weaver 8/9, Watcher 4/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 2HP, breach on cooldown. Bolt is at (2,2) facing E — position (1,2) is behind Bolt and adjacent. I can move to (1,2) and then shadow_strike Bolt for damage while staying safe. This keeps me aggressive without exposing myself. Weaver at (3,3) is 2 tiles away — must avoid ending adjacent to it.
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(2,2) ✓ → scan(5,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Bolt used precision_shot on (3,2) last turn — that's my position. Enemy Bolt at (5,2) is healthy and unscanned, priority target. Ghost and Bastion already scanned. My ally Bolt at (2,2) is wounded and adjacent to Bastion which will attack it. I should recalibrate wounded ally Bolt to buff them, but they're at (2,2) and I'm at (3,2) — adjacent! Then I can scan enemy Bolt at (5,2) dist=2 to reveal its prompt. Recalibrate first to help wounded Bolt, then scan enemy Bolt.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is the highest-value target at distance 2 — within precision_shot range and I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. I'm not adjacent to Weaver so precision_shot is unblocked. After firing, I'll hold position to maintain range advantage.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) wounded with 2HP. Bastion at (2,1) will attack me this turn — must move away. Ghost is adjacent at (1,2) and wounded. I can use precision_shot on Ghost first (dist=1, but precision_shot requires not being adjacent... wait, the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not specter). Ghost is specter, so precision_shot should work. Ghost is wounded — finishing it removes a threat. Then move away from Bastion at (2,1) to survive. Best escape: (4,2) moves me dist 3 from Bastion and away from Ghost, but that's dist 2 move. Valid moves include (4,2) which is 2 tiles east — safe from Bastion. Fire precision_shot at Ghost (1,2) first, then move to (4,2) to escape Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (2,1) with 50% damage reduction. Ghost is critical at (1,2) and needs protection. Watcher is 2 tiles away at (3,2) — if I move to (3,1) I'd be adjacent to attack, but Weaver is at (3,3) which would block abilities. Moving to (3,1) puts me adjacent to Watcher for an attack while staying 2 tiles from Weaver (safe). Ghost at (1,2) is critical — I should consider shield_wall to protect them. But moving means losing fortify. Watcher at (3,2) is wounded — getting adjacent to finish them is valuable. Move to (3,1) to be adjacent to Watcher, then attack.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,1) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,1), dist 2, in range. I can attack Bastion. Ghost is critical at (1,2) moving south toward us. I have traps at (4,3) and (5,3) already. I should place a trap on (2,2) or (2,3) to catch Ghost approaching from the west, and attack Bastion who is right in front of me. Attack Bastion first (in range at dist 2), then place a trap at (2,2) to intercept Ghost's southward path.
  State: Ghost 1/4, Bastion 7/8, Bolt 3/4, Bolt 2/4, Weaver 8/9, Watcher 2/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,1) ✓ → recalibrate(4,2) ✓
  💭 Critical situation: I'm at 2/6 HP. Foresight shows Bastion will attack me at (3,2) and Bolt will precision_shot me at (3,2) this round. I need to move away from (3,2) immediately. Ghost is at (1,2) critical and already scanned. All enemies already scanned. I should move to safety first. Valid moves include (4,1) which gets me away from Bastion at (3,1) and might dodge the incoming attacks. But (4,3) is a trap. Let me move to (4,1) - away from Bastion's melee range and changes my position so Bolt's precision_shot (aimed at 3,2) misses. Then I can recalibrate wounded Bolt ally at (4,2) since they're wounded - but after moving to (4,1), Bolt at (4,2) would be adjacent. Recalibrate needs adjacency. Moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to ally Bolt at (4,2). I can recalibrate them to help them fight better.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. I need to act aggressively before I die. Bolt is wounded at (4,2) facing E. I can move to (3,2) which is directly behind Bolt (adjacent, behind). From there I can use shadow_strike which hits adjacent enemies and keeps cloak (I may not be cloaked but it does 1dmg). Watcher is also wounded. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Bolt from behind — perfect for shadow_strike to finish a wounded enemy without breaking cloak. Weaver is at (3,3) — if I go to (3,2) I'll be 1 tile from Weaver too, which is risky but Weaver's denial is adjacent only and (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3). Wait — Weaver denial blocks abilities when adjacent. So at (3,2) I'd be adjacent to Weaver at (3,3) and my abilities would be blocked! I need to avoid being adjacent to Weaver. Let me reconsider: (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3) where Weaver is — that blocks cloak/breach. But shadow_strike... the caution says cloak/breach blocked, not shadow_strike specifically. The warning says 'avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked' — this implies ALL abilities. So I cannot use shadow_strike from (3,2) due to Weaver adjacency. Alternative: move to (2,2) — dist 2 from Bolt, not in range for shadow_strike (adjacent only). I'm at 1HP with no good plays. Best option: move to (3,2) behind Bolt and shadow_strike Bolt (kills wounded Bolt), accepting Weaver adjacency risk since shadow_strike may still work — actually the system prompt says 'cloak/breach blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector', not shadow_strike. Shadow_strike might still work! I'll go for it.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 Bolt(striker) is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot. Watcher(oracle) is wounded at dist=2 and is a high-value target (oracles support the team). I should move away from Bolt first to enable precision_shot, then eliminate Watcher. Moving to (5,1) keeps distance from Weaver (still 3+ tiles) and puts Watcher at dist=2 range for precision_shot.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 1HP - critical priority is survival. Ghost is adjacent at (3,2) and critically wounded - if I fire precision_shot I can't use it adjacent to enemy Vector, but Ghost is a specter not a vector, so precision_shot should work. Ghost is critical so finishing it prevents it from acting. But I need to survive Bastion's incoming attack. Moving to (5,2) gets me away from Bastion at (3,1) and Ghost at (3,2), increases distance. From (5,2) I can still reach Bolt at (5,1) with precision_shot (dist=1, but that's adjacent - precision_shot needs LoS and range≤2, adjacent is fine unless enemy is Vector). Bolt is a striker not vector. Actually, let me shoot Ghost first while adjacent (dist=1, in range, critical target), then move to (5,2) to escape Bastion and get away from Ghost. Wait - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Ghost is a specter, not vector, so precision_shot works. Fire precision_shot at Ghost (3,2) to eliminate it, then move to (5,2) to escape Bastion's reach and avoid trap at (4,3).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (4,1) and critical — attack to eliminate. Stay put to keep Fortify active and maintain 50% damage reduction. No move needed.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,1), distance 2 - in range for pulse (1 tile AoE) if I move adjacent. Currently at (3,3), Bastion is 2 tiles south. I can't pulse from here (need within 1 tile). My ally is critical. Traps already at (4,3), (5,3), (2,2). I should place a trap on Bastion's likely path or use pulse if I close in. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (3,1) - enabling pulse for 1 AoE damage. But getting adjacent to a sentinel is risky. Better to place a trap at (3,2) to block Bastion's advance northward, staying at (3,3). Bastion is in range at dist=2, so I can use trap targeting (3,2) which is the tile between us - forcing Bastion to step on it or go around.
  State: Bastion 7/8, Bolt 3/4, Bolt 1/4, Weaver 8/9 | Dead: Ghost, Watcher

### Turn 5 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,0) ✓ → precision_shot(5,2) ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent at (5,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I can use attack (1dmg) or suppressing_fire. Bolt is critical so any damage kills. Move to (5,0) to create distance first, then use precision_shot from range 2 on Bolt at (5,2) — wait, after moving to (5,0) dist to Bolt(5,2) is 2, and I moved so precision_shot deals 1dmg. Bolt is critical so 1dmg should finish them. Alternatively, stay and use suppressing_fire targeting Bolt for 1dmg to kill. Suppressing_fire: 1dmg 2-tile line from target, range ≤2. I'll move to (5,0) first to escape adjacency, then precision_shot Bolt at (5,2) for 1dmg (moved penalty) — that kills critical Bolt.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,2) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is 2 tiles north at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction at (3,1). Moving would lose fortify. Weaver is in denial range if I move adjacent. Best to hold position, maintain fortify, and shield_wall north to protect against incoming threat from Weaver.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,1), distance 2 — within range. Traps already placed at (3,2) and (2,2) blocking some paths. Bastion is moving toward me. I should pulse Bastion now (1dmg to all within 1 tile of me, but Bastion is dist 2 so pulse won't hit). Attack is adjacent only. Best play: move to (3,2) is trapped. Move to (4,2) to stay at range 2 of Bastion and place a trap at (3,1) or adjacent to block escape, but Bastion is AT (3,1). If I move adjacent to Bastion my Denial aura blocks their abilities. Move to (3,2) is trapped so avoid. Move south to (3,4) then trap path. Actually: Bastion at (3,1), I'm at (3,3). If I move to (3,2) that's a trap — invalid. I can stay and pulse won't reach dist 2. Better: move to (4,2) to get adjacent to Bastion (dist from 4,2 to 3,1 = 2, still not adjacent). Or move to (3,2) — trapped tile, bad. Stay at (3,3) and place trap at (4,2) to block Bolt's approach corridor. Bastion likely moving north toward our backline. I'll trap (4,2) to cover Bolt's path, then wait or pulse if Bastion closes in.
  State: Bastion 7/8, Bolt 3/4, Weaver 8/9 | Dead: Ghost, Bolt, Watcher

### Turn 6 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at dist=5, out of my range-2 precision_shot. I need to close distance. Moving to (3,0) gets me closer. From (3,0), Weaver at (3,3) is dist=3, still out of range-2. Best move is toward Weaver to get within range next turn. Move to (3,0) reduces distance to 3 — still not in range, but I can't close enough this turn to shoot. Wait after moving.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,1) dist=2, within range. Bolt is at (3,0) dist=3, out of range. My traps are already clustered around (2-4, 2-3). Bastion is moving toward me from the south. I should pulse to hit Bastion since it's within 1 tile... wait, pulse hits within 1 tile AoE and Bastion is at dist=2, so pulse won't reach. I can attack Bastion since attack is adjacent only and dist=2, so that won't work either. Best option: move south to (3,2) to get adjacent to Bastion and trigger Denial, but (3,2) has a trap - can't step there. Move to (4,2) also has a trap. Move to (2,2) also has a trap. Safe moves near Bastion: I could move to (3,4) or stay. Actually I should place a trap to further block paths. Let me trap (3,1) where Bastion currently is - wait, can't trap occupied tiles. Trap (2,1) to block western approach - need to check if within range 2 from (3,3): dist to (2,1) = |3-2|+|3-1| = 1+2 = 3, out of range. Trap (4,1): dist = 1+2 = 3, out of range. I can't place traps at range > 2. Best action: move to (4,4) to reposition and place a trap at (4,1) - but (4,1) is dist=3 from (3,3). From (4,4): dist to (4,1) = 3, still out. Move to (3,4) and trap somewhere useful within range 2. From (3,4): can trap (3,2) already trapped, (4,2) trapped, (2,2) trapped, (3,3), (4,4), (2,4), (3,5), (4,3) trapped, (2,3), (3,2) trapped. Untrapped reachable: (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,4). Bastion approaches from south - (2,3) or (4,3)(trapped) would block flanking. Move to (3,4) then trap (2,3) to block western flank.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (3,4), 3 tiles north. Bolt is at (3,0) behind me. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) which is valuable. Moving to (3,2) advances toward Weaver while keeping me between ally Bolt and the enemy. From (3,2) I'm 2 tiles from Weaver — closer but still out of attack range. I should advance to maintain front line position without getting adjacent to Weaver (denial range). Move to (3,2) to hold the line, then wait to preserve fortify next turn.
  State: Bastion 6/8, Bolt 3/4, Weaver 8/9 | Dead: Ghost, Bolt, Watcher

### Turn 7 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close distance to get a precision_shot. Moving north toward Weaver while staying at safe distance. Moving to (3,2) would put me adjacent to Bastion but Weaver is at (3,4) still dist 2 from there — within range. Let me move to (3,1) first to close distance, then check: from (3,1) Weaver at (3,4) is dist 3, still out of range 2. Need to get to dist ≤2. From (4,1) or (2,1) Weaver still dist 3+. Best I can do this turn is move 2 tiles north to (3,2) — wait, that's not in valid moves list. Valid moves include (2,1) and (3,1) and (4,1). From (3,1) Weaver is at dist 3, still out of range. I can't reach firing range this turn. Move north to (3,1) to close distance for next turn.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,2) distance 2 - within my range. Both enemies are approaching from the south. I have traps at (2,2), (4,2), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3) already placed. Bastion is healthy and close. I can pulse to hit Bastion since it's within 1 tile... wait, pulse hits within 1 tile AoE, Bastion is dist 2 so pulse won't reach. I can use attack on Bastion (dist 2, range adjacent only) - no, attack is adjacent only. My range is 2 for trap. Let me place a trap at (3,3) to catch Bastion moving north, or use pulse if I move adjacent. Better: move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Bastion at (3,2), then pulse hits Bastion (and Bolt if close enough). Moving to (3,3) puts me dist 1 from Bastion - pulse would hit. But that's aggressive. Alternatively, place trap at (3,3) to block their path north, then stay at range. Trap at (3,3) is valid - it's empty and within 2 tiles. This creates a trap corridor since (2,2),(4,2) already placed. Bastion moving north must pass through (3,3). Place trap there.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction. Weaver is at (2,4), dist=3, not adjacent. Bolt is at (3,1) behind me. My orders are to hold the front line and position between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,3) puts me closer to Weaver and between Bolt and the enemy, while still being able to use shield_wall. I should move north to (3,3) to maintain front line position, then use shield_wall facing north to protect against incoming threats from Weaver.
  State: Bastion 5/8, Bolt 3/4, Weaver 8/9 | Dead: Ghost, Bolt, Watcher

### Turn 8 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Weaver is at distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close distance to get a shot. Moving to (3,3) would put me at distance 2 from Weaver at (2,4) — but Bastion is at (3,3). Move to (2,2) instead: dist to Weaver would be sqrt(0+4)=2, exactly in range. From (2,2), Weaver at (2,4) is 2 tiles north, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both Bastion and Bolt are at distance 2 from my position (2,4). Bolt is wounded - priority target. I'm already in range of both with pulse (1-tile AoE) but they're at dist 2 so pulse won't hit them. I can place a trap at (2,3) - wait, that tile already has a trap. Let me check: traps at (4,3),(5,3),(4,2),(2,3). So (2,3) is already trapped. Bolt is at (2,2) wounded - if I move to (2,3)... that has a trap so I can't step there safely. Valid moves include (3,4) which puts me adjacent to Bastion at (3,3) - that would activate Denial but also risks melee. Better to stay at (2,4) or move to (3,5) to maintain range. Pulse requires being within 1 tile of target. Neither enemy is within 1 tile of me currently. I could move to (3,4) to be adjacent to Bastion and use pulse hitting Bastion, but that's risky. Instead: move to (1,3) to be closer to Bolt at (2,2) - dist would be 1+1=2, still not adjacent. Let me think about trap placement. I can trap at range ≤2 tiles from current pos (2,4). (3,4) is a valid tile I can reach and trap could go there. Enemies heading toward backline would move through (3,4) or (2,3). (2,3) already trapped. Place trap at (3,4) to block Bastion's northward approach. Then stay put or reposition. Actually I should move to (3,5) and trap (3,4) to create a corridor of traps blocking both enemies from advancing north.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction. Weaver is 2 tiles north at (3,5) - out of attack range and I must avoid moving adjacent due to denial. Bolt is wounded at (2,2). My best play is to hold position and use shield_wall northward to protect against Weaver's incoming attacks, maintaining fortify bonus.
  State: Bastion 5/8, Bolt 2/4, Weaver 7/9 | Dead: Ghost, Bolt, Watcher

### Turn 9 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (3,5), distance 4, out of my range 2. No enemies in range from current position. Orders say maintain distance. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer but still distance 3 from Weaver - still out of range. Moving to (2,4) gets distance 2 from Weaver at (3,5), which would put them in range. But orders say maintain distance and Weaver is a vector - dangerous to get close. Best to move toward (2,4) to get in range for precision_shot next turn, or move to (3,2) and try precision_shot from there. From (3,2) to (3,5) = distance 3, still out of range 2. From (2,4) to (3,5) = distance ~1.4, in range. But Weaver denial range is adjacent - need to stay not adjacent. (2,4) to (3,5) is diagonal distance ~1.4, adjacent. That would block precision_shot. Try (1,3) - distance to (3,5) = sqrt(4+4)=2.8, out of range. Try (3,2) - distance to (3,5) = 3, out of range. No good move gets me in range without adjacency risk. Wait and hold position, or move to best position.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(2,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(1,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Bolt is wounded at (2,4) distance 2 - in range for attack. Bastion is healthy at (3,3) distance 2. I have traps at (3,4) already blocking direct path. Bolt is wounded so attacking could finish or cripple them. I can attack Bolt this turn. Then place a trap or pulse. Pulse would hit anyone within 1 tile of me - neither enemy is adjacent so pulse won't help. I'll attack Bolt (wounded, priority target) then place a trap at (2,3) - wait, (2,3) already has a trap. Let me place at (1,4) to cover Bolt's movement corridor. Actually best play: attack Bolt to press the wounded advantage, then trap (1,4) to cut off escape/approach routes.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,4) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction. Weaver is at (3,5), 2 tiles away — moving adjacent would block abilities. Bolt is wounded at (2,4). I should stay fortified and use shield_wall to protect Bolt from the north threat. Moving would lose fortify bonus and I'm already between allies and enemy.

- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 2HP, Weaver is at (3,5) at distance 2. I have a clear shot with precision_shot for 2 damage. I haven't moved yet, so I get full damage. I should shoot first, then consider repositioning. Weaver is a vector so I must stay non-adjacent. Current position is fine — distance 2 is safe. I'll precision_shot Weaver, then move to (1,4) to increase distance and avoid adjacency risk.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 5/8 HP, Weaver is 2 tiles north at (3,5). I cannot attack Weaver from here (out of range). Moving north to (3,4) would put me adjacent to Weaver, but the caution note says to avoid moving adjacent as abilities will be blocked. Staying fortified gives me 50% damage reduction which is valuable at 5HP. Bolt is wounded at (1,4) to my west. I should hold position to keep the fortify bonus and use shield_wall northward to protect against Weaver's incoming threat.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,3) distance 2, in range for pulse (1 tile AoE) — but dist 2 means not within 1 tile, so pulse won't hit. I can attack Bastion at dist 2 with my range 2 attack. Trap at (3,4) is already placed between us. My position (3,5) is good — stay here and attack Bastion who is healthy and approaching. Use attack on Bastion at range 2.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✗ Out of range → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with 2HP, Weaver is at (3,5) dist=3, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I should shoot first before moving to maintain range advantage. After shooting, I'll reposition to keep distance from Weaver while staying in range for next turn.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,3), distance 2 - within my range. (3,4) already has a trap. I need to maintain denial pressure on Bastion while staying safe. Moving to (4,4) keeps medium range from Bastion and lets me place a trap on approach paths. But (3,4) is already trapped. Bastion is heading north toward me. I can pulse Bastion from current position since it's within 1 tile... wait, pulse range is 1 tile AoE, Bastion is at dist 2 so not in pulse range. I can attack Bastion (adjacent only) - not adjacent. Best play: stay at (3,5), place trap at (3,4)... already trapped there. Place trap at (2,4) or (4,4) to block flanking routes. Move to (4,5) first to reposition, then trap (4,4) to block eastern approach. Or stay and trap (2,4) to cover western approach. Bolt is wounded at (0,4) moving west - not immediate threat. Focus on Bastion. Place trap at (2,4) to cover western flank from current position.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 5/8 HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Bolt is wounded at (0,4). Weaver is at (4,5), dist=3, not adjacent. My orders are to hold the front line between allies and enemies. Moving would lose fortify bonus. Weaver is 3 tiles away - too far to attack or shield_wall effectively. Best play: stay fortified, wait to maintain damage reduction and hold position as a frontline barrier.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at distance 5, out of my range 2. No enemies in range. I should advance toward Weaver to get in range for precision_shot next turn, while maintaining safe distance. Moving to (2,4) closes distance to 3, still safe from adjacency denial. Then wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 Bolt is critical at (2,4) and needs protection. Weaver is at (4,5) dist=3, so I must not move adjacent. I'm fortified which gives 50% damage reduction — good defensive position. Moving to (3,4) puts me between Bolt and Weaver, maintaining the front line without getting adjacent to Weaver (dist would be ~2). Then I can use shield_wall toward N or E to protect Bolt from Weaver's threat direction.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at (3,4), distance 2 - within my attack range. Bolt is critical at (2,4), distance 3 - out of range. I should attack Bastion to finish them off if possible. But first, let me consider positioning. I'm at (4,5) with speed 1. Traps are already at (4,3), (5,3), (4,2), (2,3) - covering southern paths. Bastion at (3,4) is wounded and in range. I can attack Bastion directly from current position. After attacking, I could move to (5,5) to maintain distance or stay put. Actually, I should attack Bastion first (they're wounded, might be nearly dead), then consider placing a trap or moving. Pulse would hit Bastion at dist 2 - no, pulse range is 1 tile AoE. So I need to attack (range: adjacent? No - attack range is adjacent only, dist 1). Wait - attack is adjacent only (1 tile). Bastion is at dist 2. So I can't attack directly. But trap range is ≤2 tiles. I could trap a tile near Bastion's path. Bastion is at (3,4) facing N - they'll likely move north or toward my backline. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so trap is not blocked. I'll trap (3,5) to block northern movement, then move to maintain positioning. Actually (3,5) is a valid trap location within range 2. Then move to (5,5) to stay back.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → precision_shot(5,5) ✓
  💭 At 1HP I'm critical. Weaver is at dist 4, out of range. No enemies in range from current position. I need to move closer to get precision_shot range (≤2 tiles), but Weaver's denial zone means I can't go adjacent. Best move: go to (3,5) to get dist closer, then check range. Weaver is at (5,5), so from (3,5) dist=2 — that's exactly in precision_shot range, and not adjacent (safe from denial). I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. This could finish or heavily wound Weaver.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 50% damage reduction active. Weaver is at (5,5), dist=3, out of my attack range. Moving would lose fortify bonus. With only 4/8 HP, staying fortified is valuable. I should hold position and wait, maintaining the damage reduction passive while holding the front line.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,4) dist=3, out of range. I have traps at (4,3) and (5,3) already covering southern approach. I should move closer to get into range while placing a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=1 from Bastion and enables pulse/attack. But I need to avoid stepping on my own trap at (4,3). Move to (4,5) keeps me safe and closer, then place a trap on (3,5) to block the northern corridor approach.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 4HP, facing Weaver at (4,5) distance 2. I cannot attack from here. Moving adjacent to Weaver would block my abilities per the caution note. Best to hold position, maintain fortify bonus, and wait — preserving 50% damage reduction while keeping the front line.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,4) wounded, distance 2 - in range for attack. I'm at (4,5). Note (3,5) is a valid move tile but has a trap already. I can attack Bastion from current position since it's within range 2. Then move to maintain distance or stay. Attack first to damage the wounded Bastion, then consider repositioning. (5,5) or (5,4) gives me lateral distance while keeping Bastion in range.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (5,5), 3 tiles away to the NE. I'm fortified which gives 50% damage reduction — valuable defensively. Moving would break fortify. Weaver is wounded and out of my attack range. Best play is to hold position, maintain fortify bonus, and wait for Weaver to close in or for allies to push. No adjacent enemies to attack. Hold and stay fortified.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,4) heading N, dist=3, out of range. I have traps at (4,3),(5,3),(4,2),(2,3),(3,5). I should move closer to get in range or lay more traps on likely approach paths. Moving to (4,4) brings me to dist=2 from Bastion and lets me place a trap. The tile (3,5) already has a trap. Bastion heading N from (3,4) might move to (3,5) - already trapped. I'll move to (4,4) to get closer and place a trap at (3,4) or adjacent to cut off escape routes. Actually trap can't be on occupied tile. Bastion is at (3,4). I'll move to (4,5) and trap (3,4) after Bastion moves, or trap (3,3) to block southward movement. Move to (4,5) first, then trap (3,4) - but Bastion is there now. Better: move to (4,4), then trap (3,3) to block approaches.

### Turn 16 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4) - wounded and dangerous. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so firing from (4,4) hits Bastion at dist=1. That's 1 damage to a wounded enemy which may finish them or bring them very low. Then move to (5,5) to create distance and avoid counterattack. Denial is already suppressing Bastion's abilities since they're adjacent.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 3HP and 50% damage reduction. Weaver is at (5,5), dist=3, out of my attack range. I should maintain fortification by not moving, and wait to preserve the damage reduction bonus since I'm low HP and can't reach Weaver anyway.

### Turn 17 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,4) heading north, wounded. I have traps at (3,5) and (3,3) already blocking that column. I should move to (4,4) to maintain medium range and pressure. From there I can trap (3,4) area or use pulse if Bastion closes in. Actually (4,4) puts me adjacent to trap at (4,3) — careful. Move to (4,5) to stay safe and trap a path. The (4,4) tile is open and Bastion might push through. Let me place a trap at (4,4) to block that approach route.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,5) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 3HP, fortified. Weaver is at (4,5), distance 2, so not adjacent — can't attack. Moving would break Fortify and my 50% damage reduction, which is critical at 3HP. Weaver is wounded and to my NE. I should hold position to maintain Fortify and use shield_wall facing N or E to protect against incoming threats.

### Turn 18 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at (3,4), distance 2, within my attack range. I'm at (4,5) heading W. Trap at (3,5) already placed. I can attack Bastion directly for 1 damage - they're wounded so this could finish or heavily pressure them. Stay at range 2 to keep Denial active and avoid melee. No need to move - current position is good.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 3HP. Weaver is at (4,5), dist 2, not adjacent so I can't attack. I should maintain fortify by not moving, and hold position. No adjacent enemies to attack. Best to wait and keep 50% damage reduction active.

### Turn 19 — player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/8 HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Weaver is at (4,5), distance 2. I should maintain fortified position to keep damage reduction. No enemies in attack range. Best to hold position and wait — moving would lose fortify bonus and I'm already between the enemy and allies at a safe distance.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2) → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at dist=2, wounded. I'm at (4,5), Bastion at (3,4). I can attack for 1dmg to potentially finish them, or pulse to hit all within 1 tile. Pulse hits all within 1 tile of my position - Bastion is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach. Attack range is adjacent only (dist=1), so I can't attack either. I need to move closer. If I move to (3,5) I'd be dist=1 from Bastion at (3,4) - but (3,5) has a trap! Move to (4,4) - also has a trap. Move to (5,4) puts me at dist=2 from Bastion still. Move to (4,3) - trap there too. Most valid moves near Bastion are trapped. (5,4) gives dist=sqrt(4+0)=2 from (3,4). Let me reconsider: place a trap at a strategic location. Bastion is at (3,4) moving north. I can place a trap at (3,3) - wait that's already trapped. (2,4) or (2,5) could be good. I'm at (4,5), trap range ≤2 tiles. (2,5) is dist=2, valid. But I need to not be adjacent to enemy - Bastion is at dist=2 so I can use trap. Place trap at (2,4) to block Bastion's westward escape. Then wait or move to maintain range.

### Turn 20 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at (3,4) distance 2, within my attack range. I have traps already placed heavily around (4,3), (5,3), (4,4) - Bastion is at (3,4) heading North. I can attack Bastion directly for 1 damage since it's in range 2 (but attack is adjacent only - dist=2, so attack won't work). My attack range is adjacent only. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Bastion is at dist 2, too far for pulse. I need to move closer or use trap. I'm at (5,4), Bastion at (3,4). I can't attack at range 2. Let me move to (4,4) - wait, (4,4) is listed as a valid move AND has a trap there already, so I shouldn't move there. Move to (4,5) to get closer while staying safe, then I still can't attack (Bastion would be at dist 2 from (4,5)). Actually from (4,5) Bastion at (3,4) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, so adjacent? No, adjacency is typically 1 tile orthogonally. Bastion is wounded - place a trap at (3,5) - wait that already has a trap. Try (2,4) or trap at (3,3) - already trapped. Move to (4,5) then trap at (3,4)? Can't trap on occupied tile. Move closer: (4,4) has trap, (4,5) safe. From (4,5): Bastion at (3,4) dist=~1.4, within rng2 for abilities. Trap at (2,4) to block escape. Actually move to (4,5), trap at (3,4) is occupied. Trap (2,4) to cut off northern escape.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 20, I'm at (3,4) with 3HP, fortified with 50% damage reduction. Weaver is at (4,5), dist=2, out of my attack range. I should stay fortified to keep damage reduction active. Moving would lose fortify and I'm low HP. Weaver is wounded too. Best to hold position, maintain fortify, and wait — I can't attack from here and moving adjacent risks Weaver's denial ability.
