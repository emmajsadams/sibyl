## Squads
### Player
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Seer** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-7, need ≤4). I need to advance to bring Seer or Aegis into scan range. Moving to (2,2) reduces distance to Seer to ~2 and Aegis to ~2. From there I can scan next turn. Staying behind allies at (0,4) and (1,4). No enemies adjacent so scan isn't blocked.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(0,4) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, time to cloak. All enemies are out of range and too far to engage this turn. Snare (vector) is closest at dist 4 to the south — I must avoid getting adjacent to it or it will block cloak/breach. My priority target is Seer (oracle, the damage dealer) at (3,1). I'll cloak now and advance toward Seer's flank, moving to (1,2) to close distance while staying away from Snare at (0,0).
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is in scan range at distance 2. Scan it to reveal its prompt and deal 1 damage. Then move north to maintain distance from enemies while staying in scan range of the battlefield.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,1) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, starting at (0,0). Enemies are far - Watcher at (2,2) dist 4, Bastion at (1,4) dist 5. Move toward center to control the board, then place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (1,1) puts me in a central position. Then place trap at (2,2) - but Watcher is already there. Better to trap (1,2) to block approaches toward my allies. From (1,1) I can reach (1,2) with trap range ≤2.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,0), enemies are Watcher at (2,2) and Bastion at (1,4). I need to move forward to intercept threats and protect allies Seer at (3,4) and Snare at (1,1). Moving to (2,1) puts me between Watcher and my allies, and I stay in range to use shield_wall. I can't reach Watcher this turn (dist=2, move=2 but they're at (2,2) so moving to (2,1) then attack won't reach). Best play: move to (2,1) to advance toward Watcher, then wait to trigger Fortify passive (50% dmg reduction if I didn't use both actions with movement... wait, Fortify triggers if I didn't move). Actually I should consider: move to (2,1) gets me closer. No enemies in range to attack. I'll move north to (2,1) to advance the front line and hold position.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(1,4) S ✓
  💭 Seer is closest enemy at dist=2 to my south-east at (3,4). I should advance toward them. Moving to (2,4) closes distance to Seer and keeps me near allies Phantom and Watcher. Most enemies are to the south (Aegis, Snare) and east (Seer), so shield_wall facing S or E makes sense. I'll move toward Seer first, then use shield_wall facing S to cover allies from southern threats.
  State: Aegis 8/8, Seer 6/6, Snare 9/9, Phantom 4/4, Bastion 8/8, Watcher 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and adjacent to Snare (vector) whose denial zone blocks my abilities. I need to move away from Snare's denial zone first, then use an ability. The orders say to prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer (Seer, oracle) and use breach on sentinels. Seer is at (3,4) and I can reach behind-tile (3,3) which is reachable. But first I need to escape Snare's denial. Moving to (3,3) puts me behind Seer and adjacent — I can breach or shadow_strike Seer from there. Distance from (1,2) to (3,3) is 3 tiles (Manhattan), which fits my move speed of 3. That gets me behind Seer for a breach next turn, or I shadow_strike immediately. Actually from (3,3) I'd be adjacent to Seer at (3,4) — I can shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. But cloak expires this turn (1 remaining means it expires after this round). Best plan: move to (3,3) to get behind Seer, then shadow_strike Seer for 1 damage — shadow_strike keeps cloak active so I stay invisible.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks scan per rules. Bastion is also adjacent. I need to move away first to get scan range on Phantom. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=2 from Phantom (3,3) — scan should work. Then scan Phantom to reveal their prompt since they're a specter and high priority.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(1,1) ✓
  💭 Seer scanned me last turn and is moving to (3,4). I need to scan priority targets. Aegis is adjacent (dist=1) but scan requires ≤4 tiles - however scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, and Snare(vector) is at dist=2 so not adjacent, so scan should work. But Aegis is adjacent to me at (2,1) - scan range is ≤4, so Aegis is in range. However, I should prioritize scanning Seer who just scanned me. Seer is at dist=4 currently - the range data shows outRange for Seer at dist=4. Wait, the prompt says scan range ≤4 tiles, and Seer is exactly dist=4 - the precomputed data shows outRange for Seer. So Seer is not scannable from here. Snare is at dist=2, in range. I should move away from Aegis (adjacent enemy) and scan Snare or reposition to scan Seer. Moving to (3,2) would put me further from Snare and Aegis while keeping options. Actually I should move to increase distance from Aegis and Snare, then scan Snare from safe distance. Move to (3,2) - dist to Snare becomes 3, dist to Aegis becomes 2, no longer adjacent to enemies. Then scan Snare to reveal its trap strategy.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Watcher is closest at dist 3, approaching from (3,2). I need to advance and place a trap on a chokepoint. Moving to (1,2) keeps me safe while I can place a trap at (1,3) - but that tile already has a trap. Better to move toward (2,2) to get closer and then place a trap at (2,3) or (3,1) to intercept Watcher's approach path. From (2,2) I can trap (3,2) - directly on Watcher, but traps only work on empty tiles. I'll move to (2,2) and place trap at (3,1) to cut off approach routes between Watcher and my position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Watcher is closest at dist 2, moving to (2,3) gets me adjacent. Snare is at (2,2) — I should stay between enemies and allies. Move to (2,3) to close on Watcher and intercept threats from north. Then attack Watcher if adjacent.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Aegis, then use shield_wall facing South (toward Snare at (2,2)) to protect allies from that direction.
  State: Aegis 7/8, Seer 5/6, Snare 8/9, Phantom 3/4, Bastion 8/8, Watcher 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone, blocking my scan ability. Priority: escape denial zone first. Moving to (4,3) gets me away from Snare while staying in range of Seer. From (4,3), I can scan Seer at dist=2 to reveal their strategy. Aegis is already in known position. Snare's prompt is already known.
- **Seer** (oracle): attack(4,3) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks my scan ability per the Vector rule... wait, Watcher is an oracle not a vector. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. No enemy vectors are adjacent, so scan works. Watcher is at (4,3), dist=1 — already know Watcher's prompt. Bastion at (2,4) dist=2 — not yet scanned, in range. Phantom at (3,3) dist=2 — already scanned. Priority: scan Bastion to reveal its prompt. But Watcher is adjacent (dist=1) — attack is possible too. Watcher is the enemy scanner/support, eliminating or damaging it is high value. I have 4/6 HP. Foresight shows Watcher moved to (3,2) last turn and scanned (1,1) — but current position is (4,3). I can attack Watcher (adjacent, dist=1) for 1 damage, then scan Bastion. This damages their oracle and reveals Bastion's strategy.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✓
  💭 Priority is assassinating the enemy damage dealer (Seer, oracle). Recon shows I can reach (3,4) which is directly behind Seer at (4,4) facing E. I'm not cloaked so breach is available. Moving to (3,4) puts me behind Seer — then I can breach her, making her obey me next turn. This disrupts the enemy oracle and fulfills orders to prioritize the damage dealer. Snare is 2 tiles away at (2,2) — I must avoid moving adjacent to it. Moving to (3,4) keeps me clear of Snare.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,4) — attack it. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is optimal. After attacking, use shield_wall North to block incoming damage from Bastion's direction and protect Seer behind me.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the south. I'm fortified (50% damage reduction) and should stay put to maintain that. Attack Aegis, then use shield_wall facing south where enemies are clustered (Aegis at 2,3 and Snare at 2,2).
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel) is at (2,4), distance 2 - within trap range. Aegis is at (2,3) between me and Bastion. I should place a trap at (2,3)... wait, Aegis is there. Can't trap occupied tiles. Bastion is directly north at (2,4). I can trap at (3,3) to control the approach route from Phantom at (3,4). Or move north to (2,3)... Aegis is there. Move to (3,2) and trap (3,3) to block Phantom's path south. Phantom is at (3,4), Watcher at (4,3) - trapping (3,3) cuts off Phantom's movement south and Watcher's movement west. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so trap is not blocked. Move to (3,2) first, then trap (3,3).
  State: Aegis 6/8, Seer 4/6, Snare 8/9, Phantom 3/4, Bastion 6/8, Watcher 4/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → scan(4,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge. Allies at (2,3) and (3,2), so moving to (5,5) gets me to the corner edge and away from allies. Watcher at (4,3) is adjacent and just scanned me last turn — I should scan Watcher back since it's within range 4 and deal damage while gaining info (already known). Actually all enemies already scanned. Phantom is adjacent at (3,4) and used breach on me last turn — dangerous. I'm at 4/6 HP. Move to (5,5) to reach edge/corner per orders. Then scan isn't useful since all known. Attack Watcher at (4,3) is adjacent — deal 1 damage to the enemy oracle who keeps scanning me.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer — that's Seer (oracle). Position (5,4) is directly behind Seer and reachable in my move range. I'm cloaked, so I can move there safely. Snare at (3,2) facing E means moving to (5,4) takes me away from its denial range. Once at (5,4) I'm adjacent and behind Seer — use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while maintaining cloak. Breach cooldown still active so can't breach anyway.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/6 HP and wounded. Foresight shows Seer will attack (4,3) then scan (2,4) - I need to move away from (4,3). Snare is at (3,2) and will move to (3,2) then trap (3,3) - I must not go adjacent to Snare. I've already scanned both Seer and Snare. Aegis is unscanned and in range at dist=2. I should move to (4,4) to dodge Seer's attack, then scan Aegis to reveal its strategy. Moving to (4,4) keeps me 3 tiles from Snare (safe), 3 tiles from Aegis, and still in scan range of Aegis at dist=3. Seer was going to scan (2,4) targeting Bastion - not my concern. Aegis will attack (2,4) and shield_wall - scanning Aegis is valuable intel.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,4) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack Bastion since it's in range, and stay put to keep fortify active. Moving would lose fortify. Attack Bastion, then wait to maintain fortified status.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies at dist 3-4, none in range yet. Traps at (1,3),(3,1),(3,3) already placed. I need to advance and place a trap in the path enemies will take. Watcher at (4,4) and Bastion at (2,4) are converging. Moving to (4,3) puts me closer and lets me place a trap at (4,4) or (3,4) to intercept Watcher. Actually (3,4) is a valid move tile and would let me place a trap near enemies. Let me move to (4,3) — valid move — then place trap at (4,4) to catch Watcher who is standing there or nearby. Wait, trap goes on empty tile. Watcher is at (4,4) so that's occupied. Place trap at (5,3) to block Phantom's approach path, or (4,3) after moving there... Move to (4,2) first, then trap at (4,3) which is on the path between enemies and allies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so I shouldn't move (keeps 50% damage reduction). Most enemies are to the south/east, but Aegis is directly south, so shield_wall S would block damage from that direction if needed. Since orders say attack adjacent enemy, I'll attack Aegis. No move to preserve fortify.
  State: Aegis 4/8, Seer 3/6, Snare 8/9, Phantom 3/4, Bastion 5/8, Watcher 3/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (5,4) and targeted me last turn with shadow_strike. I'm at 3/6 HP and wounded. Orders say move away from allies and toward edge. I need to escape Phantom's adjacency. Valid moves: (5,2), (5,3), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (4,3), (3,4). Moving to (5,2) gets me far from Phantom and toward the south edge, away from allies clustered around (2-4, 2-4). Watcher is at (4,4) dist 2 - I can scan them but they're already scanned. I can scan Phantom at (5,4) for 1 damage since they're within range 4 and I won't be adjacent after moving. Actually if I move first then scan Phantom, Phantom will be at dist 3 from (5,2) - still in range 4. Scan does 1 dmg and reveals prompt (already known). Better to just attack Phantom while adjacent before moving - attack deals 1 dmg. Attack Phantom first (adjacent), then move to (5,2) to escape.
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(5,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 3/6 HP. Seer is moving to (5,5) next turn and will scan me. I should move away from Snare at (4,2) who is 2 tiles away - I must not move adjacent. Both Aegis and Seer are already scanned. Seer is wounded at (5,2) dist 3 - I can scan them but they're already known. My orders say scan priority targets and recalibrate damage dealer. Phantom is my wounded damage dealer at (5,4). I should recalibrate Phantom to boost effectiveness - but recalibrate is adjacent only and Phantom is at (5,4), I'm at (4,4), that's 1 tile away so we ARE adjacent. I can recalibrate Phantom first, then move away from Snare. Moving to (3,4) keeps me at safe distance from Snare (4,2) - that would be dist 2, safe. Or I could move to (3,5) to stay further. Let me recalibrate Phantom (adjacent at 5,4) then move to (3,4) to maintain distance from Snare.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,2) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded at (5,2) facing S — I'm at (5,4). Moving to (5,3) puts me directly behind Seer (adjacent, behind=true). From there I can shadow_strike for 1dmg without breaking cloak. Priority: eliminate the wounded oracle damage dealer.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) to my south. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis first, then shield_wall facing south to protect against further threats from that direction.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 3/8 HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Bastion is adjacent at (2,4) — I can attack. I should stay put to keep Fortify active and attack Bastion. No move, just attack then wait to preserve fortification.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at dist=2 and wounded - I can attack it. I also have traps at (3,3) and (4,3) already placed. Position (4,3) is right above me and already trapped. Phantom is at (5,3). I should attack Phantom to finish it off while wounded. My Denial passive blocks some of Phantom's abilities if I stay adjacent. I'm at (4,2), Phantom at (5,3) - distance 2, within my range 2. I'll attack Phantom. Then I can move to (4,3) - wait, that's already trapped, bad idea. Or move to (3,2) to stay near chokepoints. Actually, attack Phantom first, then move to (5,2) to get adjacent and deny abilities - but Seer is at (5,2). Stay put or move to (4,1) to place trap. Let me attack Phantom (in range at dist=2), then place a trap at (4,3) - wait it's already there. Place trap at (5,2)? Seer is there. Place trap at (5,1) - valid move tile. I'll attack Phantom first, then move to (5,1) to set up denial coverage on Phantom.
  State: Aegis 3/8, Seer 2/6, Snare 8/9, Phantom 2/4, Bastion 4/8, Watcher 3/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(5,2) ✓ → breach(5,2) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded, 1 tile away at (5,2), and I'm already behind them (they face S, I'm at (5,3) which is behind). I can shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked, then breach to take control of them next turn — or just shadow_strike and wait. At 2HP I need to be careful. Snare is at (5,1) only 2 tiles away — moving adjacent would block abilities. Shadow_strike Seer first (keeps cloak, deals damage), then breach Seer to remove them from the fight for a turn.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → scan(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 3HP, need to be careful. Seer is critical at (5,2) - priority target but at dist 4 from current position which is out of range (scan needs ≤4 tiles). If I move to (4,3) or (4,4), Seer would be at dist 3 or 4 - let me check: from (4,3) to (5,2) = |4-5|+|3-2| = 1+1 = 2, well in range. From (4,4) to (5,2) = 1+2 = 3, in range. But I must avoid Snare at (5,1) - denial blocks adjacent abilities. From (4,3), Snare at (5,1) = dist |4-5|+|3-1| = 1+2 = 3, not adjacent, safe. Move to (4,3) then scan Seer at (5,2) - dist 2, well within range. Seer is critical so scan + 1dmg could finish or weaken further. Snare is at (5,1) - not adjacent to (4,3) so denial won't block scan. This is the best play: advance to scan range and hit the critical Seer.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is at (5,3) distance 2, wounded and in range. I can attack it directly for 1 damage. My denial passive already blocks some of its abilities if it gets adjacent. I should also place a trap to control the approach. Move to (5,2) to get adjacent to Phantom for denial, then attack it. Or stay and attack from range. Phantom is wounded - finishing it is priority. Attack Phantom at (5,3) from current position (dist=2, within rng2). Then move to (5,2) to apply denial pressure and block its escape south.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) directly south. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and at 4/8 HP. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Aegis. No need to move since attacking in place keeps Fortify bonus. After attacking, I can use shield_wall facing S to protect allies Phantom and Watcher who are wounded and behind me.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP but fortified (50% damage reduction). Bastion is adjacent at (2,4) - I should attack it since it's wounded and in range. If I stay put, fortify remains active giving me damage reduction. Attack Bastion without moving to keep fortify bonus.

### Turn 7 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,1) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare (vector) at (5,2) which is blocking my abilities. I need to eliminate Snare who is healthy but adjacent. Basic attack works through denial zone. I can move to (5,1) to get behind Snare, then attack. Actually: move to (5,1) first to get behind, then shadow_strike Snare — but wait, shadow_strike is blocked by denial zone too. Only basic attack works. Let me just attack Snare from current position with basic attack (1dmg), then move to (5,1) to be behind for next turn. Or: move to (5,1) first (behind Snare), then attack Snare from behind. Either way attack is the main action. I'll move to (5,1) to get behind Snare, then attack Snare at (5,2).
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → recalibrate(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 2HP - critically low. Snare is at (5,2) which is 2 tiles away - I must not move adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. Both enemies already scanned. I should recalibrate Phantom (our damage dealer at (5,1)) to boost effectiveness against Snare, then move away to safety. Phantom is adjacent to me at (5,1) - wait, distance from (4,3) to (5,1) is 2 tiles, not adjacent. Recalibrate requires adjacent only. Bastion is at (2,4) - distance from (4,3) is 2 tiles, not adjacent either. No allies are adjacent to me. I can't recalibrate anyone. Aegis is critical and already scanned. Snare is healthy and already scanned. With 2HP I need to survive. I should move away from danger. Moving to (3,4) gets me further from Snare at (5,2). Then I can scan... but both enemies are already scanned. Wait - I could recalibrate if I move adjacent to Bastion at (2,4). Moving to (3,4) puts me 1 tile from Bastion (2,4)? No, (3,4) to (2,4) is distance 1 - adjacent! So move to (3,4) then recalibrate Bastion with an addendum to focus on finishing Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,4). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Bastion to finish them off while wounded. Then shield_wall North to protect against threats coming from that direction, or just stay put to keep fortify active. If I move I lose fortify, so stay and attack.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) and critical - attack to finish them. Then use shield_wall facing South (toward where enemies could approach) to protect allies. I'm fortified so staying put maximizes defense. Snare is far east, so shield_wall facing E or S makes sense - Snare is at (5,2) which is southeast, so face S to cover that general direction and protect Watcher at (3,4).
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(5,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (5,1) wounded - perfect pulse target, 1dmg to all within 1 tile. My denial passive already blocks Phantom's cloak/abilities. Pulse hits Phantom, possibly finishing or crippling further. After pulse, move to (4,2) to place a trap toward the center choke area near (3,1)/(3,3) cluster, or stay and deny. Actually better: pulse Phantom first (1dmg to wounded unit could finish), then move away to place trap at a choke. Wait - I can't trap adjacent to enemy. Move first to (4,2) then pulse? No - Phantom at (5,1) would be dist=2 from (4,2), outside pulse range of 1. Better to pulse now while adjacent, then move to (4,3) to set a trap between enemy positions.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(2,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, critical condition. Both enemies already scanned — no new scan value. Snare is 2 tiles away, so I must NOT move adjacent to it (would block my abilities). Bastion is adjacent at (2,4) and critical — recalibrate could help. Phantom is at (5,1) critical. I should recalibrate Bastion to boost their effectiveness, then move to safety. Recalibrate requires adjacent target — Bastion is at (2,4), I'm at (3,4), that's adjacent. I'll recalibrate Bastion first, then move to (4,5) to stay safe and away from Snare.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with 1HP — critical condition. Breach is unavailable. Snare (vector, healthy) is at (4,3), 3 tiles away — I must avoid going adjacent to Snare or my abilities get blocked. The position behind Snare is (4,2) which is adjacent to Snare, so shadow_strike would work there but I'd be right next to the vector denial zone. Aegis is critical but 5 tiles away — can't reach. My best play: move to (4,2) to get behind Snare, then shadow_strike for 1 damage. Shadow_strike keeps cloak (if I'm cloaked) and deals damage. At 1HP I need to eliminate threats fast. Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent/behind Snare for shadow_strike.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, fortified, with Bastion (critical) adjacent at (2,4). I should attack Bastion to finish it off while I still have the fortify damage reduction. Moving would lose fortify and I'm too vulnerable. Stay and attack.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,2) and critical - attack to finish. Watcher is at (4,5) wounded and in range 2. After killing Phantom, I can move to maintain denial pressure or place a trap. Bastion is out of range. My denial is already blocking Phantom's abilities. Attack Phantom first to eliminate the critical threat, then move to (4,4) to get closer to Watcher and maintain pressure.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) E ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) and critical — attack to finish them off. Then shield_wall facing S to protect against any follow-up, or N since Snare is to my northeast. Snare is at (4,4), dist 2, so not adjacent. After killing Aegis, shield_wall facing E toward Snare's general direction won't help much. Shield_wall N covers the direction Aegis was coming from and where Snare might advance.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → recalibrate(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical 2HP, adjacent to Snare (denial active blocks my abilities). I must move away first to break adjacency, then use recalibrate on Bastion who is also critical. Valid moves include (3,4) or (3,5) to break adjacency with Snare at (4,4). Moving to (3,5) keeps distance. Then recalibrate Bastion at (2,4) — range is adjacent only, so from (3,5) Bastion at (2,4) is distance ~1.4, not adjacent. From (3,4), Bastion at (2,4) is distance 1 — adjacent. Move to (3,4) first, then recalibrate Bastion.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (3,4) - wounded and within pulse range. Bastion is at (2,4) - critical and within range 2. Both enemies are clustered nearby. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so from (4,4) it hits Watcher at (3,4) (dist=1). After pulse, I can use attack on Watcher or trap. Actually, let me pulse first to hit Watcher, then move to pressure Bastion. Watcher is wounded so pulse might finish or severely damage. Bastion is critical so even 1 more damage could finish it. My denial passive already blocks Watcher's abilities since Watcher is adjacent. Pulse hits Watcher for 1dmg. Then I should attack Watcher (adjacent) or place a trap. Attack Watcher directly since it's adjacent.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✗ No unit at target → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 1HP - critically low. Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) - I must attack to finish them. After attacking, I should shield_wall facing E toward Snare at (4,4) to protect against incoming damage. I'm fortified so staying put maximizes damage reduction.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Snare** (vector): attack(2,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is critical at (2,4) distance 2 - within attack range. I'm snared (spd1) so limited movement. Attack Bastion to finish it off. Then move to better position. (3,4) is a valid move tile but has a trap there - avoid it. Move to (3,5) to maintain pressure and denial range on enemies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,5) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 1HP, fortified. Snare is at (3,5) distance 2, not adjacent so I can't attack. I need to stay fortified (50% dmg reduction) since I'm critical at 1HP. Orders conflict — Aegis mentioned at (2,3) but I see no ally there and Snare is my only enemy at (3,5). With 1HP I should stay put and use shield_wall to protect while fortified. Moving would lose fortify. Stay and shield_wall facing N (toward Snare at y=5 from my y=4, Snare is north of me).

### Turn 11 — player
- **Snare** (vector): attack(2,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is critical at (2,4) and within range 2. I can attack it directly. After attacking, I should maintain position or place a trap to control the area. Attack first to potentially finish off the critical Bastion, then place a trap at (3,3) to deny the approach path - wait, (3,3) already has a trap. Place trap at (3,4) to control the corridor instead.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✗ No unit at target → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 1HP, fortified. Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) — attack to finish them. Snare is at (3,5), dist=2, out of range. After attacking Aegis, use shield_wall facing N to protect against threats from that direction while staying fortified.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✗ No unit at target → shield_wall(2,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 1HP, fortified. No enemies adjacent. Aegis is mentioned at (2,3) which is adjacent — attack them first to finish off. Then shield_wall facing N to protect against Snare at (3,5). Fortify gives 50% damage reduction if I don't move, so stay put.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(2,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is critical and adjacent (dist=2). I can attack for 1dmg to finish them off. My denial passive also blocks their abilities since they're adjacent. Attack Bastion at (2,4), then wait or reposition.
