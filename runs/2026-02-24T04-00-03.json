But first — I can attack Hawk at dist=2 with attack (adjacent only means dist=1, so attack won't work). My abilities: trap (range ≤2), pulse (1 tile AoE adjacent). Hawk is at dist=2 so not adjacent — pulse won't hit. I should place a trap on a tile Hawk is likely to step on. Hawk is at (3,2) moving S — likely next steps: (3,1) already trapped! Good. Rampart at (2,2) moving S — (2,1) is reachable. I can move to (3,1) but that's already trapped (dangerous for me). Let me move to (5,1) to reposition slightly and place a trap at (4,2) — wait, (4,2) already trapped. Place trap at (3,0) — Hawk moving S from (3,1) (already trapped) might go to (3,0). Or move to (2,1) to trap that tile for Rampart. I'm at (4,1), move to (3,1) is risky (trap there). Move to (2,1) is valid (dist check: |4-2|+|1-1|=2, yes valid). Then place trap at (3,1)... already trapped. Place trap somewhere useful from (2,1): can reach tiles within 2. From (2,1): (2,2) where Rampart is — perfect trap placement directly on Rampart's position or (3,0),(1,0),(2,0). Actually placing trap ON enemy tile may not work (must be empty).

I can't place traps on occupied tiles or adjacent to enemies (Denial passive blocks my trap ability since Rampart is within range). I should move to (5,1) to get distance from Rampart and use pulse to hit Rampart who is at dist 2 - wait, pulse only hits within 1 tile. From (5,0) Rampart at (3,1) is dist 3, out of pulse range. Let me check: from (4,0), Rampart at (3,1) is dist 2, so not adjacent - pulse won't reach. I can't place a trap at (4,1) - already has one. Valid trap targets would be empty tiles within 2 range. From current position I can attack Rampart (adjacent-only, dist 2 - no, attack is adjacent only meaning dist 1). Rampart is at dist 2 so attack won't work either. My best move: reposition to (5,1) to stay away from Rampart, then place a trap on (4,1) - already has one. Try placing trap at (5,2) - already has one. Place trap at (3,0) from (5,1)? dist=2, valid.
