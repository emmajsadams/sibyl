Lifeline is at (2,4) and Longshot at (2,2) - both in range at dist=2. I should pulse to hit both enemies since they're within range. My position (3,3) with pulse range 1 tile means I need adjacency... actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of me, so I need enemies adjacent. They're at dist=2 so pulse won't reach them. I can attack one of them at range 2. Longshot is a striker threat. I'll attack Longshot to pressure them. I can't place a trap at (2,3) since one is already there. Valid moves: (2,3) has a trap so stepping there is risky. I'll move to (4,3) to maintain position and deny abilities to adjacent enemies, then attack Longshot.",
