## Squads
### Player
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Doc** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
### Opponent
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(0,0) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies in scan range at dist=4. Wraith is specter (high threat, stealth). Scan Wraith first to reveal their strategy. Then recalibrate Hawk (striker, damage dealer) to boost effectiveness.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. All enemies are out of range. After cloaking, move toward Insight (the oracle/damage dealer priority target) at (3,1). Best approach: cloak first, then move to (3,3) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → overclock(3,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies are full HP so no healing needed. Insight is adjacent at (3,1). I should move toward allies and use overclock on Insight (oracle, high-value damage dealer) since all are healthy. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Insight at (3,1).
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from (0,0). Closest threat is Bolt at (2,4), dist 6. I need range 2 for precision_shot. Move toward Bolt to close distance. Best move is to (2,0) to advance northeast, keeping distance from adjacency. Still won't be in range after one move but closing gap.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is in range at dist=3 from current position (2,4). Orders say target the enemy medic when no one is wounded. I can use precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles, 2dmg) but dist=3 is outside precision_shot range. I need to move closer. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist=1 from Doc at (3,2) — that's adjacent, which I must avoid. Moving to (1,3) puts dist to Doc(3,2) = |3-1|+|2-3|=2+1=3, still out of range. Moving to (2,3) puts dist to Doc = |3-2|+|2-3|=1+1=2, which is within precision_shot range and not adjacent. But wait — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy. At (2,3) vs Doc(3,2): not adjacent (dist=2). Safe. Move to (2,3) then fire precision_shot on Doc.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Doc at (3,2), dist=3. I'm at (3,5) with mv2. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer but Bolt and Wraith are there. Move to (3,4) to advance toward Doc. Enemies are mostly to the south (N from my perspective since I face S), clustered around x=3,y=0-2. Use shield_wall facing S to protect allies behind me.
  State: Doc 8/9, Hawk 5/5, Insight 5/6, Warden 12/12, Bolt 5/5, Wraith 4/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Foresight shows Bolt will precision_shot Doc at (3,2) — I should scan Bolt to reveal his prompt and deal 1 damage. Warden will shield_wall at (3,3) facing S. With my second ability use, I'll recalibrate Doc (adjacent at 3,2) to help him survive Bolt's incoming shot. Stay at current position — no enemies adjacent, good range on both targets.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Insight is the priority target (oracle = damage dealer). I can reach (3,0) which is behind Insight at (3,1) facing N. Moving there gives me an adjacent position behind Insight — perfect for breach next turn or shadow_strike now. Let me move to (3,0) behind Insight, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → patch(3,1) ✓
  💭 Insight is wounded at (3,1) with 4/6 HP and is adjacent to me at (3,2). I need to heal them. But Bolt is targeting me with precision_shot at my current position (3,2). I should move first to dodge, then heal Insight. Moving to (4,1) gets me away from (3,2) and keeps Insight within range — wait, Insight is at (3,1), distance from (4,1) would be sqrt(1+0)=1, adjacent! Or I could move to (2,1), distance to (3,1) = 1, also adjacent. Let me move to (4,1) to dodge Bolt's precision_shot, then patch Insight at (3,1) which will be adjacent.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so orders say to target the enemy medic Doc. Doc is at dist=4, out of range from current position (2,3). I need to move closer. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Doc at (4,1) — dist would be sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, so dist=2, in range. From (3,2) to (4,1): dx=1, dy=1, dist=2. That puts Doc in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved adjacent to any enemy. Hawk is at (2,0) dist=3 from (3,2), Insight at (3,1) dist=1 from (3,2) — that's adjacent! Avoid. Try (2,2): to Doc(4,1) dx=2,dy=1, dist=3 — still out of range. Try (3,3): to Doc(4,1) dx=1,dy=2, dist=3 — out of range. Try (4,3) from valid moves: to Doc(4,1) dx=0,dy=2, dist=2 — in range! Check adjacency: Hawk@(2,0) dist far, Insight@(3,1) dx=1,dy=2 dist=3, not adjacent. Good. Precision_shot from (4,3) to Doc(4,1) — I moved, so it deals 1dmg instead of 2. Still worth it to follow orders and target medic.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist=5). I need to close distance. Valid moves include (4,0) which gets me closer to Bolt at (4,3) reducing distance to 3, still out of range but better positioned. Moving to (4,0) keeps me away from adjacency. No ability possible this turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Insight at (3,1), distance 3. I can move toward it. Moving to (3,2) closes to distance 1 from Insight. Enemies are concentrated to the south (Doc, Hawk, Insight all at y=0-1), so shield_wall facing S makes sense. But I have no adjacent ally to shield_wall. I'll advance to (3,2) to get adjacent to Insight next turn, and wait on ability since no target is adjacent yet.
  State: Doc 7/9, Hawk 5/5, Insight 6/6, Warden 12/12, Bolt 4/5, Wraith 4/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel, not a Vector. However, being adjacent is dangerous and I should maintain range. Bolt at (4,3) is already scanned. Warden at dist=1 is a prime scan target to reveal their strategy. I can scan Warden first (dist=1, within range 4), then move away to avoid adjacency risk. Move to (2,1) after scanning to create distance from Warden while staying behind allies.
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(4,0) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and already behind Hawk (facing E, I'm at 3,0 which is west/behind him). I should use breach on Hawk now while cloaked — breach doesn't break cloak. Wait, breach DOES break cloak. But shadow_strike doesn't. Hawk is the priority damage dealer (striker). I'm already adjacent and behind him. I can shadow_strike for 1dmg while keeping cloak, or breach him. Orders say prioritize assassinating the damage dealer. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1dmg. But cloak only has 1 turn left anyway. Better to breach Hawk — forces him to obey me next turn, effectively neutralizing the striker. I'm at (3,0), Hawk is at (4,0) facing E, I'm behind him. Breach requires being BEHIND enemy by facing — confirmed. I'll breach Hawk first (no move needed), then move to (4,2) to get behind Doc for next turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (4,0) facing E. Valid moves include (5,0) and (5,1) which are toward the east edge. Moving to (5,0) gets me to the corner edge, furthest from the combat cluster near (3-4, 2-3). I'll move to (5,0) then wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic Doc per orders. Doc is at (4,1), distance 2, within precision_shot range. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved so I get full 2dmg. Stay at current position to maintain range and fire.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → overclock(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 4/9 HP, adjacent to Wraith at (4,2). Bolt is targeting me with precision_shot this turn — I need to reposition. Valid moves: [3,0],[3,1],[4,0],[5,1],[5,2]. Moving to (3,1) puts distance from Bolt at (4,3) and Wraith at (4,2), and keeps me closer to Insight at (2,1). All allies are at full HP so no healing needed. After moving, I can attack Wraith if still adjacent, but from (3,1) Wraith at (4,2) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent. From (5,1), Wraith at (4,2) is also dist ~1.41. None of my moves keep me adjacent to Wraith for attack while also dodging. Best move: (3,1) to break from Wraith adjacency and reduce Bolt's precision shot effectiveness. Then overclock on... wait, no adjacent ally after moving to (3,1) — Insight is at (2,1), dist=1, adjacent! I can overclock Insight. But I take 1 damage (already at 4HP). Alternatively just wait or move and wait. Moving to (3,1) gets me adjacent to Insight at (2,1) for overclock. Overclock will bring me to 3HP but empowers Insight (oracle) who is a strong damage dealer. Worth it.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) S ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (3,1) — attack immediately. Most enemies are to the south/southwest. I'm already fortified, so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Doc, then use shield_wall facing south to cover allies from that direction.
  State: Doc 3/9, Hawk 5/5, Insight 5/6, Warden 11/12, Bolt 4/5, Wraith 4/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Doc is wounded and I'm already behind them (facing W, I'm at 4,2 and can move to 4,1 which is behind). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1dmg. Move to 4,1 (behind Doc) then shadow_strike Doc to finish them off while staying cloaked.
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(5,0) ✓ → recalibrate(3,1) ✓
  💭 Overclocked — 2 ability uses this turn. All three enemies already scanned, so no scan value. Wraith is the biggest threat: it's adjacent to Hawk and will try to assassinate our damage dealer. Recalibrate Hawk to boost effectiveness against Wraith. Then recalibrate Doc to help keep team alive — but Doc is critical and needs support. Actually, recalibrate Hawk at (5,0) to boost damage output against Wraith who is flanking. Second ability: Wraith is at (4,1), dist 2 — out of attack range (adjacent only). Can't attack Wraith. Warden is at (3,2) dist 2 — also not adjacent. No valid attack targets. Best second use: recalibrate Doc at (3,1) who is critical, to help them survive. Stay at current position to maintain range advantage.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,1) ✗ Position occupied → patch(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (2/9) with Warden at dist=1 and Wraith at dist=1 — extremely dangerous. Orders say move toward (2,1) to survive. Insight is wounded at (2,1) with 5/6 HP, adjacent to that tile. If I move to (2,1) I'll be adjacent to Insight and can patch her. But wait — patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Need to check if (2,1) puts me adjacent to enemies. Moving to (2,1): Warden is at (3,2) dist=2, Wraith at (4,1) dist=2 — not adjacent, so patch is NOT blocked. I can move to (2,1) then patch Insight to heal her 2HP (5→6, full). That satisfies orders: stay adjacent to threatened ally, use patch on wounded teammate, and escapes the danger zone.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is critical and in range at dist=3. I'm at (4,3), Doc at (3,1). I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Doc is critical - this should secure the kill. Stay at current position to maintain range advantage.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,1) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (4,1), distance 2 from my position (5,0). I'm not adjacent to Wraith so precision_shot is not blocked. I should attack Wraith with precision_shot for 2 damage. Orders say move away from combat, but also say priority is to attack Wraith immediately. I'll use precision_shot on Wraith first, then move to (5,2) to reposition away from allies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) S ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (3,1) — attack immediately. Hawk is at (5,2) and Insight at (2,1), both to my south/sides. After attacking Doc, I'll shield_wall facing South to cover the direction with most enemies (Insight to SW, Doc to S).
  State: Doc 1/9, Hawk 5/5, Insight 6/6, Warden 11/12, Bolt 4/5, Wraith 1/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at critical HP at (4,1) and is about to shadow_strike Doc at (3,1) again. Wraith is within scan range (dist 2). I should scan Wraith to deal 1 damage — though Wraith is already scanned, so no benefit there. Actually, all enemies are already scanned. Priority: Wraith is critical and threatening Doc. I can scan Wraith to deal 1 damage and potentially finish it off (if it's at 1HP critical). Wraith's prompt says it will shadow_strike Doc again. I should recalibrate Hawk instead to boost damage output since all prompts are known. Actually, recalibrate range is adjacent only — Hawk is at (5,2), not adjacent to me at (2,1). Doc is adjacent at (3,1). I can scan Wraith at (4,1) from (2,1) — dist 2, within range 4. This deals 1 damage. Then I could move closer to recalibrate Hawk, but Hawk is far. Better: scan Wraith to chip damage, then move to reposition away from threats. Wraith will move to (4,1) and shadow_strike (3,1) — Doc is critical. I'm at (2,1). Moving west keeps me safe. Let me scan Wraith first (dealing damage to critical unit), then move to (1,1) to stay safe from Warden/Wraith.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → move(1,1) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at critical 1HP with Warden adjacent at (3,2) and Bolt targeting me with precision_shot. I must flee immediately. Moving to (1,1) puts me next to Insight and gets me 2 tiles away. Both allies are full HP so no patch needed. After moving, I can overclock Insight at (1,1) to boost our damage dealer.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, away from combat. I'm at (5,2) on the east edge already. I'll move to (5,4) to go north along the edge, away from enemies. No attack ordered despite the system message about Wraith - my orders are to move away. Moving to (5,4) puts me further from Warden at (3,2) and Bolt at (4,3).
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent at dist=2 and healthy. Doc is critical but out of range at dist=4. Orders say use precision_shot on most wounded, but Doc is out of range. Hawk is in range at dist=2. I should not move adjacent to enemies. Current position (4,3) is dist=2 from Hawk at (5,4) - not adjacent, so precision_shot is valid. Fire precision_shot at Hawk since that's the only in-range target.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(2,1) ✓
  💭 Doc is the nearest enemy at distance 2, currently critical. Moving to (2,2) closes distance to Doc at (2,1) making it adjacent. After moving I lose Fortify, but I can then attack Doc. Bolt is my ally at (4,3). Enemies are mostly to the west/southwest. I'll move toward Doc and attack.
  State: Hawk 2/5, Insight 6/6, Warden 11/12, Bolt 4/5 | Dead: Doc, Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are already scanned — prompts known. Bolt is out of range (dist 5). Warden is in range at dist 2 but I need to avoid getting adjacent. Hawk is wounded and Bolt will keep targeting them with precision_shot. I should recalibrate Hawk to boost their effectiveness, but Hawk is at (5,4) — far away, recalibrate is adjacent only. Can't reach Hawk to recalibrate. I should reposition to get Bolt in scan range next turn and stay safe. Moving to (4,1) gets me closer to Bolt (dist ~3) while staying away from Warden. But Warden is at (2,2) and moves toward enemies — if I move toward (4,1), Warden moves away from me. Actually Warden already scanned, no need to re-scan. Bolt needs scanning? No — already scanned too. Both prompts known. So I should focus on utility: recalibrate Hawk. Hawk at (5,4), I'm at (1,1) — too far. Best play: move closer to Hawk to recalibrate next turn, or wait. Move toward (4,1) to stay in position, then wait. Actually I can move to (1,2) or (1,3) to stay safe and be ready. Let me move to (3,1) to get closer to Hawk's side while keeping distance from Warden at (2,2) — dist from (3,1) to (2,2) = 2, not adjacent, safe. From (3,1) I could recalibrate if Hawk moves closer. For now, move to (3,1) and wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and at distance 2 - perfect range for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved so no damage penalty. Staying at current position keeps me at max range away from both enemies. Fire precision_shot on Hawk to finish them off.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,1) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (3,1), distance 2 to my south-east. I need to advance. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Insight at (3,1), enabling an attack. Enemy is to my south from (3,2), so shield_wall facing S would block damage. Move to (3,2) then attack Insight.
  State: Insight 5/6, Warden 11/12, Bolt 4/5 | Dead: Doc, Hawk, Wraith

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,1) ✓ → scan(4,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) which blocks scan per rules. Bolt is at range 3, already scanned. Foresight shows Warden will attack me at (3,1) this turn — I need to move away. Move to (2,1) to escape Warden's adjacency and get distance. Then scan Bolt... wait, Bolt is already scanned. Both enemies are known. I should recalibrate an ally or scan... but all enemies are already scanned. Move away from Warden to avoid their attack, then wait or reposition. Move to (2,1) puts me at dist 2 from Warden — safe. From (2,1), Bolt is at dist ~3 still in range. I could scan Bolt again for 1 damage since it's healthy, or just wait. Scan Bolt from (2,1): dist from (2,1) to (4,3) = 2+2=4, exactly range 4 — valid. Scan deals 1 dmg.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Insight is at (2,1), distance 4 - out of my range 2. I need to close to range 2 without going adjacent. Moving to (3,2) would put me adjacent to Warden but distance 2 from Insight - wait, let me check: from (3,2) to (2,1) is sqrt(1+1)=1.4, so dist=2 in Chebyshev? Actually dist = max(|3-2|,|2-1|) = max(1,1) = 1, that's adjacent. From (3,3) to (2,1): max(1,2)=2, that's range 2. But I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg. Valid moves include (3,3). From (3,3), Insight at (2,1) is distance max(1,2)=2, within range 2. I moved so precision_shot = 1dmg. Still worth shooting. Need LoS check - no obstacles mentioned. Use precision_shot.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(2,1) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (2,1), distance 2 to my SW. I can move to (2,2) to get adjacent to Insight, then attack. Moving will lose Fortify but attacking is the priority. Bolt is wounded at (3,3) — shield_wall could help but advancing on Insight is the order.
  State: Insight 4/6, Warden 11/12, Bolt 3/5 | Dead: Doc, Hawk, Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,0) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,2) which blocks scan. Bolt is wounded at (3,3) and within scan range (dist 3). I need to move away from Warden first to unblock scan, then scan Bolt. Moving to (1,1) puts me dist 1 from Warden (still adjacent). Moving to (0,1) gets me away from Warden adjacency and Bolt is still within range 4. From (0,1), Bolt at (3,3) is dist 5 — too far. From (1,2), dist to Warden is sqrt(1+0)=1 still adjacent. I need to break adjacency with Warden. Warden is at (2,2). Adjacent means dist<=1. To break adjacency I need dist>1. From (0,1): Warden dist = sqrt(4+1)=2.24 — not adjacent! Bolt at (3,3) from (0,1): dist = sqrt(9+4)=3.6, so 3+1=4 tiles... actually Manhattan: |3-0|+|3-1|=3+2=5. Too far. From (1,0): Warden Manhattan |2-1|+|2-0|=1+2=3. Not adjacent. Bolt from (1,0): |3-1|+|3-0|=2+3=5. Too far. From (2,0): Warden |2-2|+|2-0|=0+2=2. Not adjacent. Bolt from (2,0): |3-2|+|3-0|=1+3=4. In range! So move to (2,0) then scan Bolt at (3,3).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,0) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (2,0), distance 4 from my position (3,3). My max range is 2, so I need to close to distance ≤2. Valid moves include (3,1) which would put me at distance 3 from (2,0) - still out of range. (2,3) puts me at distance 3. (3,2) puts me at distance ~2.2 from (2,0) - dist = sqrt(1+4)=2.2, out of range. (2,4) is farther. Let me check (3,1): dist to (2,0) = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, in range! That gets me adjacent-ish but not adjacent to enemy. Move to (3,1) to get within range 2 of Insight at (2,0), then use precision_shot.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → attack(2,0) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (2,0), distance 2 to my south. I need to advance toward them. Moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent to Insight at (2,0), then I can attack. Bolt is at (3,1) wounded to my south-east. Moving to (2,1) first, then attacking Insight who will be directly south.
  State: Insight 2/6, Warden 11/12, Bolt 2/5 | Dead: Doc, Hawk, Wraith

### Turn 9 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,0) with 2HP, critically wounded. Foresight shows Bolt will use precision_shot on me and Warden will attack me — I'll take lethal damage if I stay. Warden is adjacent at (2,1), which blocks my scan ability. I must move away from Warden to survive and escape Bolt's shot. Moving to (4,0) gets me distance from both. After moving, Warden is at dist 2+, Bolt at dist ~2 — both now out of adjacent range. I can then scan Bolt (already scanned, skip) — actually both enemies already scanned. I'll move to (4,1) to maximize distance, then wait since all enemies are already scanned and I have no heal.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 Insight is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first to use precision_shot. Moving to (5,1) puts me at dist=2 from Insight at (4,1), enabling precision_shot. Insight is wounded so this could secure a kill.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,1) E ✓
  💭 Insight is at (4,1), distance 2. I'm at (2,1). Moving to (3,1) closes to adjacent range. Enemies are to my East, so shield_wall facing E protects against Insight. After moving, I lose Fortify but can use shield_wall E to protect Bolt who is wounded at (5,1).
  State: Insight 1/6, Warden 11/12, Bolt 2/5 | Dead: Doc, Hawk, Wraith
