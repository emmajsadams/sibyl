## Squads
### Player
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
### Opponent
- **Lens** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP. No healing needed. Orders say use overclock on damage dealer if all healthy. Longshot is our striker at (5,1) but dist=5, too far. Bulwark is sentinel at (2,0), dist=3. I should move toward Longshot to support, but can't reach in one move. Move toward center to position near allies. Overclock requires adjacent target — no allies adjacent currently. Best move: advance toward Longshot along bottom row. Move to (3,1) to close distance, then wait since no adjacent allies for overclock.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-7, need ≤4). Closest are Bulwark at dist 5 and Lifeline at dist 5. I need to advance south to bring enemies into scan range. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to Bulwark (dist 3) and Lifeline (dist 3). That will let me scan next turn. No enemies in range for abilities this turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 6+). Orders say maintain distance and prioritize medics. Lifeline is the priority target at dist 6. I need to close to range 2 to use precision_shot. Moving toward Lifeline at (3,1) — best approach is toward center. Move to (1,3) to advance while staying cautious. Still out of range after move, so wait as second action.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (minimum dist 4, max range 2). Closest is Lens at dist 4. I need to advance to get Lens in range. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while maintaining some distance per orders. From (4,2) Lens at (2,2) would be dist 2 — in range for precision_shot. Let me check: move to (4,2) first, then use precision_shot on Lens (oracle = high value target).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. I should advance to hold the front line and position between allies and incoming threats. Moving to (2,3) brings me closer to enemies while staying near Hawk at (1,3) and Lens at (2,2). I'll wait as second action since no enemies are adjacent.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) N ✓
  💭 Lens is closest at dist=2, at (2,2). I can move to (2,1) to close distance. Most enemies are to the North, so shield_wall facing N will protect allies behind me.
  State: Bulwark 10/10, Longshot 5/5, Lifeline 14/14, Aegis 10/10, Hawk 5/5, Lens 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → overclock(4,2) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on my damage dealer when all healthy. Longshot is the striker at (4,2), dist=2 from me. I need to move adjacent to Longshot first, then overclock. Moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,2). Then overclock Longshot.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(4,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot targeted me last turn with precision_shot at (2,2) — I'm at risk here. Bulwark is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks scan. I need to move away from Bulwark first to enable scan, then scan Longshot who is the priority threat targeting me. Moving to (3,2) keeps distance from Bulwark, stays in scan range of Longshot (dist from 3,2 to 4,2 = 1) and Lifeline. From (3,2) I can scan Longshot to reveal their prompt.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 Priority targets are medic (Lifeline) and damage dealer (Longshot), but both are out of range. Bulwark (sentinel) is in range at dist=3 but low priority. I should advance toward high-value targets while maintaining distance. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Longshot at (4,2) — that would put Longshot at dist=2, in range for precision_shot. From (3,3), Longshot dist = |4-3|+|2-3| = 2, in range. I'm not adjacent to any Vector so precision_shot is available. Move first, then shoot Longshot.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Lens (oracle) is adjacent at (3,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Hawk (striker) is at dist 2, in range for precision_shot. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers. No medic in range. Lens is adjacent so I can't use precision_shot on it. I'll use precision_shot on Hawk (dist 2, high value damage dealer). Then use suppressing_fire targeting Lens to slow it — fire a 2-tile line from Lens position. But Lens is adjacent, so suppressing_fire at dist 1 is within range 2. Actually I should move first to break adjacency with Lens if needed, but precision_shot on Hawk doesn't require breaking adjacency (only Hawk triggers the block, not Lens — wait, the warning says 'blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' — Vector is a class? No, the warning says 'precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' — Vector must be a class name. Lens is oracle, Hawk is striker, Aegis is sentinel. None are Vector class. So precision_shot is NOT blocked here. I can use precision_shot on Hawk AND precision_shot on Lens (both in range). Two precision shots with overclocked — target Lens first (adjacent, dist 1, in range ≤2), then Hawk (dist 2).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,2) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. Bulwark is 2 tiles south at (2,1) - if I stay put I keep fortify. Allies Hawk and Lens are wounded behind/beside me. Best play: stay fortified, use shield_wall southward to protect against Bulwark's advance.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Enemies are at (2,3), (3,2), and (3,3). Nearest are Aegis and Lens at dist=2. I need to advance toward them. Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (2,3) and closer to Lens at (3,2). From (2,2), enemies are mostly to the N and E. I'll move to (2,2) then use shield_wall facing N since Aegis is directly north.
  State: Bulwark 10/10, Longshot 3/5, Lifeline 14/14, Aegis 10/10, Hawk 3/5, Lens 3/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 3/6 HP, adjacent to Bulwark at (2,2) and Longshot at (4,2). Being adjacent to Bulwark blocks scan. I need to move away from Bulwark first to enable scan. Valid moves include (3,4) or (4,3) which would increase distance from Bulwark while keeping Lifeline in scan range. Move to (4,3) puts me 2 tiles from Lifeline at (4,1) — still in scan range — and 1 tile from Longshot at (4,2). But I need to avoid adjacent enemies for scan. Move to (3,4) distances me from both Bulwark and Longshot. From (3,4), Lifeline at (4,1) is dist=3, still in range. Longshot at (4,2) is dist=2. Lifeline is healthy and healing enemies — highest priority scan target since her prompt is unknown. Scan Lifeline after moving to (3,4).
- **Lifeline** (medic): patch(4,2) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded at (4,2) with 3/5 HP and is adjacent to me at (4,1) - dist=1. I should use patch to heal them. After healing, I can move closer to the action or stay. Longshot is the most threatened ally needing immediate heal.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and in range at dist=2. Precision shot will finish or heavily damage. Orders say damage dealers after medics, but no enemy medic visible — Hawk is priority target. I'm not adjacent to any Vector, so precision_shot is available. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg. After shooting, I can stay put or reposition. Lens is wounded too at dist=3, also in range. Hawk is closer and more immediate threat. Fire precision_shot at Hawk first, then assess. No need to move — current position has good range coverage.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, critical condition. Lifeline (medic) is adjacent at (3,2) — top priority target per orders. However, precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... Lifeline is a medic not Vector, so precision_shot should work. But wait — Lifeline is at dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles with LoS, so it should fire. However I need to check if moving first would help — if I move away I maintain distance and avoid being adjacent. But orders say medics first. I should shoot Lifeline with precision_shot now (she's adjacent so range=1 ≤2, valid), then move away to safety. At 1HP I must survive. Move to (4,3) after shooting to increase distance from enemies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark to deal damage, then use shield_wall facing South to protect Hawk (critical) and Lens (wounded) from Longshot and Lifeline threats coming from the south. Stay in place to keep Fortify active.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the north at (2,3). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so I should stay put to keep damage reduction, but I need to attack Aegis. I'll attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing north where enemies are clustered (Aegis at N, Lens and Hawk beyond).
  State: Bulwark 9/10, Longshot 5/5, Lifeline 11/14, Aegis 9/10, Hawk 1/5, Lens 3/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): patch(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded at (2,2) adjacent to me at (3,2) — I can patch them now. I'm at (3,2), Bulwark is at (2,2), that's distance 1 so adjacent. Use patch on Bulwark first. Then move to stay close to Bulwark who is the most threatened ally near enemies Aegis at (2,3).
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,2) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP/6HP — wounded. Foresight shows Longshot used precision_shot on (3,3) last turn, meaning they're targeting my position area. Bulwark is the only enemy whose prompt I haven't scanned yet. All enemies are in scan range from current position. Bulwark is at dist=3, in range. I should scan Bulwark to complete intel. Then I can move to safety — away from Longshot's precision_shot targeting. Moving to (5,5) puts me at max distance from threats. Actually, I should scan Bulwark first (valuable intel), then move to safety. Hawk is critical — but recalibrate requires adjacent, and Hawk is at (4,3) which is not adjacent to me at (3,4). I'll scan Bulwark from current position, then move to (5,5) to increase distance from enemies.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent (dist=1) and critical — one shot finishes them. However, precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy. Hawk is at dist=1 which is adjacent, so precision_shot won't work. I can use suppressing_fire to hit Hawk, or move away first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (5,3) puts me at dist=2 from Hawk (4,3), clearing the adjacency block, then precision_shot for 2dmg kills the critical Hawk. Priority: eliminate critical Hawk.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) to my south. I'm fortified (50% DR) and at 9/10 HP. Best play: attack Bulwark while staying put to maintain Fortify. No reason to move — I'm already on the front line between allies and enemies. Attack Bulwark, then wait to keep fortification.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the north at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing north (toward Aegis) to protect allies.
  State: Bulwark 8/10, Longshot 5/5, Lifeline 11/14, Aegis 8/10, Lens 3/6 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 3HP, low health. Longshot is at (5,3) distance 2 - already scanned. Longshot used precision_shot on (4,3) last turn, likely targeting me next. I need to reposition to avoid being shot. Moving to (3,5) puts me further from Longshot and still within scan range of enemies. From (3,5) I can scan Lifeline at (3,2) which is distance 3 - within range. Lifeline's prompt is already known. Bulwark and Lifeline are out of range from current position. Best play: move away from Longshot's line of fire, then scan Lifeline isn't needed since already known. I could recalibrate Aegis but they're at (2,3) - not adjacent. Move to (4,4) to reposition, then wait since all enemy prompts are known and I'm low HP. Actually, moving to (3,5) gets me away from Longshot. From there I'm still in range to scan if needed. Since all visible enemies are scanned, I should just reposition safely.
- **Lifeline** (medic): patch(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded at 8/10 HP and adjacent to me (dist=1, at (2,2) while I'm at (3,2)). I have 1 heal remaining. Priority is to patch Bulwark. I should move closer if needed, but Bulwark is already adjacent. Use patch on Bulwark at (2,2), then wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle, wounded) is the priority target but out of range at dist=4. Aegis (sentinel, healthy) is in range at dist=3 but sentinels are lower priority. I need to close distance to reach Lens. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Lens at (3,5) — dist would be ~2, bringing them in range. Then I can precision_shot Lens. Maintain distance from Aegis at (2,3) by staying on the east side.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the north at (2,3). I'm fortified (50% damage reduction) and at full health. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing north since that's where the enemies are concentrated.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with Bulwark adjacent to the south at (2,2). I should attack Bulwark since it's in range, and stay put to keep fortify active. Lens is wounded behind me - I can shield_wall to the south to block incoming damage from Bulwark's direction.
  State: Bulwark 9/10, Longshot 5/5, Lifeline 11/14, Aegis 7/10, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 6 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → recalibrate(2,3) ✓
  💭 HP is critically low at 2/6. Foresight shows Longshot will precision_shot me at (3,5) this turn — I must move away. Longshot is at (4,4), so moving west/away is safer. All three enemies already scanned. I should recalibrate Aegis who is adjacent-ish, but Aegis is at (2,3) and I need to be adjacent. Best move: go to (2,4) which puts me adjacent to Aegis at (2,3) for recalibrate, and gets me out of Longshot's current position line. From (2,4), Aegis at (2,3) is adjacent (distance 1). Recalibrate Aegis to attack Bulwark aggressively since Bulwark is right next to Aegis.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → overclock(2,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) and wounded at 9/10 HP. I should move adjacent to Bulwark and use overclock to boost them, since I can't heal. Moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (2,2). Then use overclock on Bulwark.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is wounded and at distance 2 — priority target. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg and could finish or cripple the oracle. Aegis is healthy sentinel at distance 3, lower priority. I'll shoot Lens first, then hold position or reposition slightly. No need to move before shooting since Lens is already in range at dist 2.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent to the south. I'm fortified (50% damage reduction). Attack Bulwark first, then use shield_wall facing S to block the counterattack. Staying put preserves Fortify.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the north at (2,3). Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) and am fortified (didn't move, 50% DR active). I should stay put to keep fortify and attack Aegis twice with both ability uses.
  State: Bulwark 8/10, Longshot 5/5, Lifeline 11/14, Aegis 5/10 | Dead: Hawk, Lens

### Turn 7 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bulwark is wounded at (2,2) adjacent to me. I should use overclock on Bulwark to boost their effectiveness. Aegis enemy is at (2,3), which is adjacent to Bulwark — but Aegis is a sentinel, not a Vector, so overclock is not blocked. I'll overclock Bulwark to give them 2 abilities next turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded and in range at distance 3. I'm a striker with precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles). Distance 3 is out of precision_shot range. I need to close to range 2. Moving to (3,3) puts me at distance ~1.4 from Aegis at (2,3) — too close, could get adjacent issues. Moving to (3,4) gives dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still adjacent range. Moving to (4,3) gives dist=sqrt(4+0)=2 from (2,3), that's exactly 2 tiles. That works for precision_shot and keeps distance. Aegis is wounded so priority is to finish it. Move to (4,3) then precision_shot Aegis.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the north at (2,3) and wounded. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) and fortify is active so I should stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis twice.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Bulwark is adjacent to my south. Orders are clear: attack Bulwark, then shield_wall facing S to block counterattack. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
  State: Bulwark 7/10, Longshot 5/5, Lifeline 11/14, Aegis 2/10 | Dead: Hawk, Lens
