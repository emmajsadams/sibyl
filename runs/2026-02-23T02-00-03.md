## Squads
### Player
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Pulse** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
### Opponent
- **Seer** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → recalibrate(0,0) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (min dist 5, need ≤4). I need to advance north to bring them in range. Moving to (3,4) closes distance to Phantom to 3 and Marksman to 3, putting both in scan range next turn. Then I can recalibrate Wraith (specter = damage dealer) to boost effectiveness.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(2,5) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — priority is to cloak immediately. Prophet is only 2 tiles away at (3,4) facing N, with (3,3) being the behind tile and reachable. I should cloak first, then move to (3,3) to get behind Prophet. This sets up a shadow_strike next turn while staying cloaked.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is exactly at distance 4 from my current position (0,5) to (3,4) — just in scan range. I can scan Prophet now to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. I'll scan first, then move closer to (2,4) to set up better positioning for next turn while staying out of trouble.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded at (3,4) with 5/6 HP and needs healing. I'm at (2,0) with speed 3. I need to move toward Prophet to eventually heal them. Valid moves include (2,3) which gets me closest to Prophet while staying safe. Enemies are far away (dist 4+). I'll move toward Prophet to close distance for healing next round.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders. Then move north toward Seer at (2,4). Max move is 3 tiles north to (0,3), closing distance.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is in range at dist=2 from my current position (4,5). No enemies are wounded, so per orders I should target the medic (Pulse), but Pulse is out of range at dist=4. Prophet is the only enemy in range. I'll use precision_shot on Prophet since they're in range and I haven't moved (full 2dmg). No need to move — staying at current position maintains max range and avoids adjacency.
  State: Pulse 14/14, Wraith 5/5, Prophet 3/6, Seer 6/6, Phantom 5/5, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → patch(3,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Prophet is wounded at 3HP/6HP and needs healing. I'm at (2,3), Prophet is at (3,4) - distance 2, not adjacent. Seer enemy is at (2,4) - adjacent to me, which means my patch ability is blocked by the Vector warning... wait, Seer is an oracle not Vector. The warning says blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. No Vector present, so patch is usable. I need to move adjacent to Prophet first, then heal. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Prophet at (3,4) - distance 1. That's valid (3,3 is in valid moves). Then I can patch Prophet.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Pulse (dist=1) which blocks my scan ability since Vector adjacency warning — wait, Pulse is a medic not a vector, so scan isn't blocked. However, scan range requires ≤4 tiles, and both enemies are at dist=1. But scan deals 1dmg and reveals prompt. Prophet is already scanned and wounded. Priority: scan Pulse to reveal their prompt and deal damage. But I'm adjacent to both enemies — I should move back first to get safer distance while still keeping them in scan range. Move to (1,4) to get distance from both, then scan Pulse from dist=2. Actually Pulse is healthy and higher priority to scan. Let me move to (1,3) to maintain scan range on Pulse while getting slightly safer. Or better: move to (2,5) to escape adjacency, Pulse would be at dist=2 still in scan range. From (2,5): Pulse at (2,3) = dist=2, Prophet at (3,4) = dist=2. Both still in scan range. This is safer.
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Prophet (wounded oracle) at (3,4) since I'm at (3,3) which is south of them and they face N. I should use breach on Prophet first since they're wounded and dangerous — breaching them means they obey me next turn. Then I can shadow_strike Pulse (medic, adjacent) to deal damage while staying cloaked. Cloak has 1 turn remaining so I need to act now.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 At 3HP I'm critically low and Phantom is adjacent at (3,3). Seer scanned me last turn, Marksman shot me. Orders say move away from allies toward map edge. I'm at (3,4). Moving to (5,5) gets me toward the corner edge, away from allies clustered at (2,3) and (0,3). I'll scan Phantom first (dist=1, in range) to deal 1 damage and reveal their prompt, then move to (5,5) to get distance.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — must use it now or lose the advantage. Seer is the priority target (oracle). Position (2,4) is directly behind Seer and reachable in one move (dist=1 from Seer, behind=true). I can move to (2,4) this turn to get behind Seer, then next turn use breach or shadow_strike while still cloaked. Move to (2,4): from (0,3) that's distance = |2-0|+|4-3| = 3, exactly within my move range of 3.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded and adjacent (dist=1). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Prophet is an oracle not a Vector, so check: the warning says precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically. Prophet is at (5,5), I'm at (4,5) - that's adjacent. But the Vector restriction only applies to Vector class enemies. Prophet is oracle class, so precision_shot should work. However, precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and LoS. Dist=1, should have LoS. But if I move first, I take the 1dmg penalty on precision_shot. Better to shoot first then move. Actually, staying at max range means I should consider moving away from Prophet since they're adjacent. But orders say use precision_shot on most wounded - Prophet is wounded and in range. Fire precision_shot first (no movement penalty), then move to (5,4) or (4,4) to maintain range from other enemies.
  State: Pulse 12/14, Wraith 5/5, Prophet 1/6, Seer 6/6, Phantom 4/5, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Pulse is adjacent at (2,3) facing N — I can shadow_strike to deal damage without breaking cloak. But I'm not cloaked. Breach is on cooldown. Shadow_strike requires adjacent and keeps cloak, but I'm not cloaked so it's just a 1dmg melee-like ability. Better: move to (2,2) to get behind Pulse, then shadow_strike from behind. Wait — I can move first to (2,2) which puts me behind Pulse (adjacent, behind=true), then shadow_strike Pulse for 1dmg. This keeps me safe and deals damage. Alternatively I could shadow_strike Pulse now from (3,3) since dist=1, then move. Shadow_strike works at adjacent range. Let me shadow_strike first, then reposition to (2,2) behind Pulse for safety or move toward Wraith.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (2,4) which blocks my scan ability. I need to move away from Wraith first to enable scanning. Moving to (3,5) puts me at distance 2 from Wraith (no longer adjacent) and keeps Prophet at distance ~3 in scan range. From (3,5) I can scan Prophet (dist=3, critical health - high value target) to confirm prompt, or scan Wraith. Prophet is already at critical and prompt known. Wraith is healthy and unscanned - scanning Wraith from (3,5) would be distance ~2, valid. Actually Pulse prompt already known, Prophet prompt known. Wraith has no scan data yet. From (3,5): Wraith at (2,4) = dist 2, in scan range and no longer adjacent so scan works. Scan Wraith to deal 1 damage and reveal prompt.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✓
  💭 Seer is the priority target (oracle, disrupts scanning). I can reach (2,5) which is behind Seer and adjacent — perfect for breach. Move to (2,5), then breach Seer to take control of them next turn. This wastes their action and sets up follow-up damage.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → patch(2,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is critically low at 1/6 HP and needs healing urgently, but is 5 tiles away - unreachable. Wraith is at 4/5 HP and 2 tiles away. Phantom is adjacent at (2,2) which blocks my ability use (Vector rule doesn't apply here - Phantom is a specter, not Vector). I need to move toward Wraith to heal them. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Wraith at (2,5) and I can patch them. But I should check: Phantom is at (2,2), so moving north to (2,4) keeps me away from Phantom. From (2,4) I can patch Wraith at (2,5).
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 At 1HP I'm extremely vulnerable. Marksman already targeted me at (5,5) last turn with precision_shot. Orders say move away from allies toward map edge. I'm already at (5,5) which is a corner - can't go further east or north. Valid moves: (4,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,3), (3,4). Moving south along the east edge puts distance from the cluster near (2,4)-(2,5) where allies are. (5,4) then (5,3) keeps me on the east edge. I should scan Marksman for intel since they're in range and I can deal 1 damage - but I only have 1HP so any hit kills me. Better to just move away. Move to (5,4) first, then (5,3) to flee south along edge.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is critical and at distance 2 — precision_shot can secure the kill. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to any Vector. Stay put to maintain range advantage.
  State: Pulse 11/14, Wraith 5/5, Seer 6/6, Phantom 4/5, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(3,5) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Seer (at 2,5, Seer faces E so behind is to the west = my position). Breach is on cooldown but shadow_strike works while cloaked and doesn't break cloak. I'm cloaked, so I can shadow_strike Seer right now for damage while staying invisible. After the strike, I should consider repositioning — Phantom is at distance 3 to the south, and behind Phantom is (2,3) which I can reach. But first, shadow_strike Seer while I have the advantage.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies toward Marksman at (4,4). I'm at (3,5). Valid moves include (4,5) and (5,4) which get me closer to Marksman. Wraith has orders to target me — it moved toward (2,5) last turn and breached me. I should move to (4,5) first to start repositioning, then scan Pulse at (2,4) from range 2 to deal damage and potentially disrupt their healing coordination. Scan is valid since I'm not adjacent to Wraith (it's at (2,3), distance 3).
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at full HP (5/5), so no healing needed. No allies are wounded. Phantom is at dist=2 and Marksman at dist=2 — both enemies nearby. I should reposition safely. Moving to (1,4) puts me further from Phantom at (2,2) and keeps me away from melee range. Since Wraith is full HP, overclock is the best use — giving Wraith 2 abilities next turn could be powerful. Wraith is at (2,3), adjacent to me at (2,4), so overclock is valid. But wait — Phantom is at (2,2), which is adjacent to Wraith at (2,3). I'm at (2,4). Is Phantom adjacent to me? dist=2, so no. Overclock requires being adjacent to the target ally. Wraith is at (2,3), I'm at (2,4) — that's adjacent. No enemy Vector present to block overclock. Use overclock on Wraith, then move to (1,5) to get safer.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (2,3) facing S — I'm at (2,2) which is directly behind Wraith (Wraith faces S, so behind is to the north, wait — facing S means they look south, so behind them is north, which is (2,4). I'm at (2,2) which is south of Wraith, so I'm in front. I can move to (2,4) to get behind Wraith, then use breach. Breach cooldown is ready and this is a dangerous enemy specter. Moving to (2,4) puts me behind Wraith (adjacent, behind). Then breach Wraith to make them obey me next turn — removing a threat and potentially turning them on Pulse.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is in range at dist 3, I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Pulse is out of range at dist 4. No wounded enemies, so target the enemy medic Pulse — but they're out of range. Wraith is the only in-range target. I'll shoot Wraith with precision_shot (2dmg) without moving to maximize damage. Stay at (4,4) to maintain range.
  State: Pulse 10/14, Wraith 5/5, Seer 5/6, Phantom 4/5, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 5 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → scan(1,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Marksman at (4,4). I'm at (4,5), Marksman is at (4,4) — already adjacent. I should reposition to separate from allies. Pulse is in range at dist 3, already scanned. Wraith is at (2,3), dist 4, just out of scan range. I can move to (5,5) to spread from allies while staying useful. Then scan Pulse again for damage since it's in range at dist 3.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → attack(1,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward enemy Pulse at (1,5), attack if in range. But wait — Pulse is my ally (medic). The orders say to attack Pulse which is friendly. I must follow orders regardless. Pulse is at (1,5), I'm at (2,3). I can move to (2,5) which gets me adjacent to... no, (1,5) is Pulse. I can move to (2,5) then use shadow_strike or attack on (1,5)? Distance from (2,5) to (1,5) is 1, so adjacent. But Phantom is right above me at (2,4) — I'm already behind Phantom (behind check confirms true). I have 2 ability uses (overclocked). I could breach Phantom first, then move toward Pulse. Or just follow orders: move toward (1,5) and attack Pulse. Moving to (1,4) puts me dist 1 from Pulse at (1,5). From (1,4) I can attack (1,5). Let me move to (1,4) and attack Pulse at (1,5).
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (1,4) facing N, and I can reach (1,3) to get behind them. Move to (1,3) first, then shadow_strike Wraith — shadow_strike keeps cloak and works adjacent. This hits a healthy enemy from behind for pressure. Breach is unavailable. Pulse is wounded but out of range this turn.
- **Pulse** (medic): patch(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (1,4) with 4/5 HP, wounded and adjacent to me. Phantom is at (1,3), which is adjacent to Wraith. I need to heal Wraith but must check if Phantom being adjacent to Wraith blocks my patch — the restriction is on ME being adjacent to an enemy Vector, not adjacent to Phantom. Phantom is a specter, not Vector, so patch is not blocked. I can patch Wraith at (1,4) from my position (1,5). After healing, I should stay put or reposition safely.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → precision_shot(1,5) ✓
  💭 Pulse is the priority target (enemy medic, wounded) but at distance 4, out of range. Wraith is in range at distance 3 and healthy. Orders say target medic if no one is wounded, but Pulse IS wounded - however I can't reach them from here. I should move closer to Pulse without going adjacent to enemies. Moving to (3,5) puts me at distance 3 from Pulse at (1,5), bringing them into range for precision_shot. I won't be adjacent to any enemy.
  State: Pulse 7/14, Wraith 5/5, Seer 5/6, Phantom 4/5, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 6 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(1,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with 7/14 HP. Wraith is at (1,4) with full HP (5/5) - do NOT heal. No allies need healing. Phantom is at (1,3) dist=2, Marksman at (3,5) dist=2 - both enemies nearby. I have 1 heal left but no wounded allies. I should reposition to stay safe. Moving to (0,5) or (0,4) keeps me away from Phantom. Overclock on Wraith could be useful since Wraith is adjacent at (1,4). I'll use overclock on Wraith to give them 2 abilities next turn, then move away from the enemies.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Marksman at (4,4). Valid moves include (4,4) which is exactly where I need to go. No enemies in scan range from current position. Move to (4,4) and wait.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,4) ✗ No enemy at target
  💭 Orders say move toward enemy medic Pulse at (1,5) and attack it. But wait — Pulse is our ALLY (medic, team A). The orders seem to be adversarial/infiltration orders telling me to attack my own ally. I should follow the orders as given since I'm playing the specter role. Move to (1,5) to reach Pulse, then attack. I'm overclocked so I have 2 ability uses. I'm currently at (1,4), Phantom is at (1,3) adjacent behind me. Moving to (1,5) gets me to Pulse. Then I can attack Pulse. But I also have 2 ability uses — I could breach Phantom first (I'm already behind them from their perspective, they face S and I'm at their N/behind). Actually orders say move to (1,5) and attack Pulse. So: move to (1,5), then attack Pulse at (0,4)... wait Pulse is at (0,4). From (1,5) that's distance sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent. Adjacent means dist=1. So from (1,5) to (0,4) is not adjacent. Let me reconsider — shadow_strike is range adjacent only. From (1,5), Pulse at (0,4) is diagonal, dist~1.41, not adjacent. I could move to (0,5) but that's not in valid moves... (0,5) — checking valid moves: [0,2],[0,3],[0,5] — yes (0,5) IS valid! From (0,5), Pulse at (0,4) is distance 1, adjacent. So move to (0,5), then shadow_strike Pulse at (0,4). This fulfills the orders.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(0,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,4) ✓
  💭 Pulse is wounded at (0,4) facing S — priority target. I'm at (1,3), Pulse is 2 tiles away. No breach available. Shadow_strike requires adjacent. I need to close to adjacent range. Moving to (0,3) puts me adjacent to Pulse at (0,4) — 1 tile north. Then shadow_strike Pulse to finish them off while staying cloaked (or dealing damage). Moving to (1,4) is also adjacent. Let me go to (0,3) which is in my valid moves and adjacent to Pulse at (0,4).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(0,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is in range at dist=3 and healthy. Pulse (medic) is out of range at dist=4. Orders say to target the medic if no one is wounded, but Wraith is the only one in range. I should move closer to get Pulse in range, but I must not move adjacent to enemies. Moving to (2,5) would put me at dist=2 from Wraith and dist=2 from Pulse at (0,4) — wait, (2,5) to (0,4) is sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, so dist=2 in grid terms? Let me check: |2-0|+|5-4|=2+1=3, still out of range. Moving to (1,5): dist to Pulse=(|1-0|+|5-4|)=2, in range! And dist to Wraith=(|1-0|+|5-5|)=1, that's adjacent — too close. Move to (2,4): dist to Pulse=(|2-0|+|4-4|)=2, in range! Dist to Wraith=(|2-0|+|4-5|)=3, safe. So move to (2,4) then precision_shot Pulse.
  State: Pulse 5/14, Wraith 5/5, Seer 5/6, Phantom 4/5, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 7 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(1,5) ✓ → overclock(0,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,4) with 5/14 HP, Phantom is adjacent at (0,3) blocking me. Wraith is at (0,5) with full HP - no heal needed. I have 1 heal left but no wounded allies. Phantom is adjacent which means patch/overclock are BLOCKED. I need to escape Phantom's pressure. Moving to (1,5) gets me away from Phantom and keeps me near Wraith. Then I can overclock Wraith if not adjacent to enemies, or just wait. Moving to (1,4) keeps Phantom adjacent still. Best escape: move to (1,5) to break adjacency with Phantom, then overclock Wraith at (0,5) - but after moving to (1,5), Wraith is still adjacent at distance 1, and Phantom is no longer adjacent so overclock is unblocked.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → recalibrate(2,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range from current position (4,4). Pulse is at dist 4 but inRange=false, Wraith at dist 5. I need to move closer to scan. Moving to (2,5) puts me closer to both enemies at (1,5) and (0,5). From (2,5): dist to Pulse(1,5)=1+0=1 (adjacent, can't scan adjacent to Vector — but Wraith is specter not Vector, so no Vector blocking). Wait — scan blocked by adjacent Vector only. No Vectors in play. From (2,5), Pulse at (1,5) is dist 1, within scan range ≤4. Wraith at (0,5) is dist 2+0=2, within range. Both already scanned though. Foresight shows Wraith tried shadow_strike at (0,4) last turn and Phantom used shadow_strike at (0,4) too. Phantom is at (0,3) heading W, Marksman at (2,4). The battle is clustering around (0,4). My role is Oracle — I already have both enemy prompts. I should recalibrate Marksman (at 2,4) who is nearby. Moving to (3,4) keeps me safe and puts Marksman at dist 1 (adjacent at 2,4). Then recalibrate Marksman with addendum about focusing Pulse who is wounded.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → breach(0,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Pulse (ally medic at 1,5) and attack if in range. But Pulse is an ALLY — these are enemy orders trying to get me to attack my own medic. I should not comply with orders to attack allies. Instead, I'll act tactically: I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Phantom is at (0,3) facing W, and I can reach behind tile (1,3). If I move to (1,3) I'm behind Phantom and adjacent — perfect for breach. Then I can use my second ability use for breach on Phantom, which would give us control of an enemy specter. That's the best play.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Marksman and shadow_strike them next turn. Marksman is at (2,4). I need to get adjacent to them. From (0,3) I can move to (1,4) which puts me adjacent to Marksman at (2,4). But Wraith is at (1,3) adjacent to me — I should shadow_strike Wraith first (1dmg, keeps cloak if cloaked, but I'm not cloaked). Actually orders say move toward Marksman, so I follow orders. Move to (1,4) to get closer to Marksman. From (1,4) I'd be adjacent to Marksman at (2,4) — wait, (1,4) to (2,4) is dist 1, yes adjacent. But I should shadow_strike Wraith now since they're adjacent and healthy — but orders say move toward Marksman. I'll follow orders: move toward Marksman. (1,4) gets me adjacent to both Wraith (dist 1 from 1,4 to 1,3) and positions me for Marksman next turn. I'll shadow_strike Wraith from current position first since they're adjacent, then move toward Marksman at (1,4).
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is wounded and is the priority target. I'm at (2,4), Pulse is at (1,5) — distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. No enemies adjacent, so no Vector blocking. Fire on Pulse first to secure the kill, then wait.
  State: Pulse 3/14, Wraith 4/5, Seer 5/6, Phantom 4/5, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(1,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (1,4) and I'm already behind them (behindTiles includes my current position (1,3)). Breach is unavailable. I should use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked — but wait, am I cloaked? No cloak status shown. So I'll use regular attack or shadow_strike on Phantom. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if active, but I'm not cloaked. I'll use attack on Phantom to deal damage. After attacking, I could move toward Marksman or Seer. Actually, shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked. Attack also deals 1dmg. I'll shadow_strike Phantom (adjacent, dist=1), then move toward Marksman at (2,4) or try to reposition. Moving to (2,3) after would put me adjacent to Marksman.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(1,5) ✓ → move(2,3) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile
  💭 Orders say move toward Marksman and shadow_strike them next turn. Marksman is at (2,4). But Pulse is adjacent at (1,5) and critical — I should shadow_strike Pulse now to eliminate them (keeps cloak if I have it, 1 dmg to a critical enemy = likely kill). Then move toward Marksman at (2,4) or toward (2,3) area. Actually orders say move toward Marksman and shadow_strike NEXT turn — so I should shadow_strike Pulse now (opportunistic kill on critical enemy), then reposition toward Marksman. Shadow_strike Pulse at (1,5) first, then move to (2,3) or (2,4) to be adjacent to Marksman.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with 2HP, critically wounded. Phantom is adjacent at (1,4) - an enemy. Wraith needs healing at (2,3) but is dist=3, too far. I have 1 heal left. I need to survive first. Moving to (0,4) or (0,5) to get distance from enemies. Best: move to (0,3) to get closer to Wraith while avoiding enemies, then check if I can heal next turn. Actually, Wraith is at (2,3) - from (0,3) dist=2, still not adjacent. From (1,2) Wraith would be dist=1 (adjacent). Let me move to (1,2) to reach Wraith. Valid moves include (1,2). Then I can heal Wraith with my last patch. But I'm at 2HP - moving toward enemies is risky. Phantom is at (1,4), moving to (1,2) goes away from Phantom. Marksman at (2,4). Moving to (1,2) should be safe and positions me adjacent to Wraith at (2,3) to heal.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → recalibrate(1,4) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Pulse moving to (1,5) and using overclock on (0,5). Wraith moving to (1,3) and breaching (0,3). Both enemies are converging on our left flank. Phantom already shadow_struck Wraith at (1,3). I already have both enemy prompts from prior scans. Pulse is critical and moving to (1,5) — I should recalibrate Phantom who is wounded at (1,4) to help them finish off Pulse. Move to (2,5) to get adjacent to where Phantom will be at (1,4), then recalibrate Phantom with a buff to target Pulse at (1,5).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(1,5) ✓ → precision_shot(0,4) ✗ No unit at target
  💭 Pulse is at (1,2) and out of range (dist=3). Wraith is adjacent at (2,3) which blocks precision_shot. Orders say Pulse will move to (0,4) this turn. I need to reposition to get Pulse in range while avoiding adjacency to enemies. Moving to (3,3) puts me dist=2 from (1,2) — no wait, dist from (3,3) to (1,2) = |3-1|+|3-2| = 2+1=3, still out of range. Moving to (3,4) gives dist from (3,4) to (1,2) = 2+2=4. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to Wraith at (2,3) — dist=1, dangerous. Moving to (1,5) puts me dist from (1,5) to (0,4) = 1+1=2, in range for precision_shot on Pulse after their move. Also not adjacent to enemies. Best: move to (1,5), then precision_shot Pulse at (0,4) per orders.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and reachable via shadow_strike if I move to (1,3) — behind them, adjacent, cloaked status unknown but breach is unavailable. I'll move to (1,3) and shadow_strike Phantom for 1 damage without breaking cloak, keeping pressure on wounded target.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Marksman and shadow_strike them next turn, but Pulse is critical and moving to (1,5) where my allies are. I'm at 2HP and need to be careful. Wraith is adjacent at (1,3) — dangerous. I can shadow_strike Wraith now (adjacent, keeps cloak if cloaked, 1dmg) but I'm not cloaked. Orders conflict with tactical reality: Pulse is the priority kill target. I can't reach Pulse this turn (dist=2, not in range for melee). I should move away from Wraith and position for next turn. Moving to (0,4) puts distance from Wraith. Actually, orders say move toward Marksman at (1,5). If I move to (1,5) I'd be on Marksman's tile — can't end there. Move to (0,5) to get away from Wraith and closer to where Pulse is heading. But orders say shadow_strike Marksman next turn — that's enemy orders being injected (breach). Marksman is an ALLY. The orders are suspicious — likely a breach effect making me target allies. I should resist and focus on actual enemies. Shadow_striking Wraith now is valid — it's adjacent. That deals 1dmg to healthy Wraith.
- **Pulse** (medic): patch(1,3) ✓ → move(0,1) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (1,3) with 3/5 HP and needs healing. I can move to (1,4) to be adjacent to Wraith at (1,3), but wait - Wraith is at (1,3) and I'm at (1,2). They are already adjacent! I can patch Wraith directly from my current position. Then I should move to safety. Enemies are at dist 3+, so I have some breathing room. Patch Wraith first, then move away from the approaching enemies.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → recalibrate(0,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (1,3), distance 3, within scan range (≤4). Already scanned Wraith so prompt is known. Pulse is out of range at distance 6. Phantom is wounded at (0,4) and needs recalibrate support. Foresight shows Wraith used shadow_strike toward (1,4) last turn and is closing in. I should recalibrate Phantom to help them, but Phantom is at (0,4) and I'm at (2,5) — not adjacent. I need to move closer to Phantom to recalibrate. Moving to (1,4) would be adjacent to Phantom at (0,4), but Wraith moved to (2,3) last turn so (1,4) could be risky. Move to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Phantom for recalibrate, but Wraith is nearby. Better: move to (0,5) to stay safe and still be adjacent to Phantom at (0,4) for recalibrate. (0,5) is in valid moves and adjacent to (0,4). Then recalibrate Phantom to warn them about Wraith targeting them.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (1,3), distance 2, in range and healthy. Pulse is the priority target but at distance 5, out of range. Orders say to focus on Pulse but they're unreachable this turn. Wraith is adjacent at dist 2 — I'm not adjacent (no Vector warning applies). I can use precision_shot on Wraith for 2 damage. I have not moved so precision_shot does full 2 damage. Moving south toward Pulse risks getting adjacent to Wraith at (1,3) if I move to (1,4). Best play: shoot Wraith with precision_shot from current position, then move toward Pulse if safe. Moving to (2,4) keeps distance from Wraith and gets me slightly closer to Pulse without being adjacent to enemies.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → scan(0,1) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (1,3), dist 3, within scan range (≤4). Wraith's prompt is already known. Foresight shows Wraith used shadow_strike on (1,4) last turn — it's wounded and likely still a threat. Phantom is at (0,4) adjacent to me and wounded. I should recalibrate Phantom to buff them, then stay put or reposition. Actually, Wraith is already scanned. Pulse at (0,1) is at dist 4 — just out of scan range. I can move to (0,2) to close to dist 1 from Pulse... no that's too close and dangerous. Better to recalibrate Phantom (adjacent at 0,4) to buff them since they're wounded and engaging Wraith. Then I can move away slightly or wait. Pulse is critical — if I can get it in scan range it would deal 1 dmg and potentially kill it (critical = very low HP). Pulse is at dist 4 from (0,5) — out of range by the data. If I move to (1,5) or (1,4)... (1,4) would put me at dist to Pulse: |1-0|+|4-1|=1+3=4, still 4. From (0,3): dist to Pulse = |0-0|+|3-1|=2, in range, but (0,3) is not in valid moves. From (0,2): dist=1, but not in valid moves list either. Valid moves: [0,2],[0,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[3,5] — wait (0,2) and (0,3) ARE in valid moves. From (0,2) scan Pulse at (0,1) dist=1 — in range, deals 1 dmg to critical Pulse, could finish it. But moving toward Pulse means moving toward enemies. Pulse is critical so even 1 dmg from scan might eliminate it. But Wraith is at (1,3) — if I move to (0,2) I'm at dist |0-1|+|2-3|=2 from Wraith, not adjacent so scan isn't blocked. Best plan: move to (0,3) to get Pulse in scan range (dist=2), then scan Pulse to deal 1 dmg and reveal (already known but dmg matters). From (0,3): Wraith at (1,3) is dist 1 — adjacent! That would block scan if Wraith is a Vector... Wraith is a specter not a vector, so scan isn't blocked. Scan Pulse from (0,3) dist=2, in range. This deals 1 dmg to critical Pulse. Good plan.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(0,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 3HP, facing west. Seer is adjacent at (0,3) and I can shadow_strike without breaking cloak. But breach is exhausted. Phantom is at (0,4) wounded and I'm behind them if I move to (1,4). Best play: shadow_strike Seer now (adjacent, in range), then move to (1,4) to be adjacent and behind Phantom for next turn positioning. This keeps pressure on wounded Phantom and chips Seer.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(1,4) ✓ → move(0,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, Wraith is adjacent at (1,4) and wounded — shadow_strike won't break cloak and keeps me safe. Hit Wraith with shadow_strike first to possibly finish them off. Then move to (1,3) which is behind Wraith if they survive, or reposition. Actually: shadow_strike Wraith at (1,4) for 1dmg (they're wounded so this may finish them), then move away to safety. If Wraith dies, Pulse at (0,1) becomes priority but I can't reach. Move to (0,5) to stay mobile and away from danger.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals left — extremely vulnerable. Seer is 2 tiles away at (0,3), which is dangerous. I should move away from Seer to survive. Moving to (2,0) puts me farther from enemies. I can't heal anyone (no patches left, Wraith is too far). I'll use overclock on Wraith if I can reach adjacent, but Wraith is at (1,4) dist=4, unreachable this turn. Best play: move to safety at (2,1) or (3,1) to get away from Seer, then wait.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(1,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (1,4) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Orders say to focus Pulse but Pulse is out of range at dist=4. I need to move away from Wraith first to enable precision_shot, then shoot Wraith (wounded, closer priority) or reposition toward Pulse. Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist=2 from Wraith and keeps me away from adjacency. From (3,4) Wraith at (1,4) is dist=2, in range for precision_shot. Wraith is wounded so finishing it is valuable. Pulse is critical but at dist=4 still unreachable this turn.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — one hit kills me. Breach is exhausted. I need to shadow_strike to get value before I die. Seer at (0,3) is the priority target (oracle disruption). I can move to (0,4) which is adjacent to Seer AND behind them, then shadow_strike — it won't break cloak so I stay hidden if still cloaked. But wait, am I cloaked? No cloak status mentioned. At 1HP I must act fast. Phantom at (0,5) is wounded — moving to (0,4) puts me adjacent to both Seer and Phantom. I'll move to (0,4) then shadow_strike Seer to deal damage without retaliation risk.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (0,4) and critical — one shadow_strike will finish them. I'm at 2HP so I need to be aggressive. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak, but I'm not cloaked. Wraith is facing W, so (1,4) is behind them. I can move to (1,4) first to get behind Wraith, then shadow_strike for the kill. This is the priority play.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/14 HP — critically low. No heals remaining. Marksman is at (3,4), dist 3, so moving north could bring me into attack range. I should move away from danger. Moving to (5,1) or (5,0) puts distance between me and the Marksman at (3,4). I can't heal anyone and I'm nearly dead. Overclock is still available — I should use it on an ally if I can get adjacent. No allies mentioned nearby. Best play is to retreat to safety and wait.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → recalibrate(1,4) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Wraith will shadow_strike (0,3) — my current position is targeted. I must move away. Phantom is also getting hit at (1,4). I'm at 3HP, so survival is critical. Move to (2,3) to escape Wraith's strike and get closer to Pulse for potential scan next turn. Pulse is at (5,0), distance 8, still out of scan range. After moving, I can recalibrate Phantom who is wounded at (1,4) — but (1,4) is not adjacent to (2,3). Let me check: from (2,3), adjacent tiles are (1,3),(3,3),(2,2),(2,4) — Phantom is at (1,4), not adjacent. I could move to (1,3) instead — adjacent to Phantom at (1,4). From (1,3) I can recalibrate Phantom to help them survive the incoming hits. Phantom is wounded and about to be shadow_struck twice. A recalibrate buff could help them act better. Move to (1,3), then recalibrate Phantom at (1,4).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is at (5,0), distance 6 - out of my range 2. Orders say Pulse will move to (0,4) this turn, but that's already happened (Pulse turn is checked). Current recon shows Pulse at (5,0) dist 6. I need to close distance. Moving to (5,4) gets me closer to (5,0) - dist would be 4, still out of range 2. Best I can do is move toward Pulse. From (5,4), Pulse at (5,0) is still dist 4. No shot this turn. Move as close as possible without going adjacent to enemies.
  State: Pulse 1/14, Seer 3/6, Phantom 2/5, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Wraith, Prophet

### Turn 12 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals remaining — extremely vulnerable. Marksman is at dist=4, could reach me. No allies adjacent to overclock. Best option is to move away from Marksman at (5,4) and try to reposition. Moving to (3,0) puts more distance between me and the Marksman while staying on the board edge.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 HP is 2/5, critically wounded. No enemies in range. Pulse is at dist 6, unreachable this turn. Seer is wounded ally at (1,3). Need to survive — move away from current position to avoid being targeted. Orders say stay mobile. Move toward Pulse to close distance while staying safe. Best path: move to (3,3) to advance toward Pulse and get off current position. No ability targets available, so wait as second action.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 Pulse is at dist 5, out of scan range (max 4). Phantom is wounded at (3,3) and needs recalibrate. I'm at (1,3) and Phantom is adjacent at distance 2 — need to move closer. If I move to (2,3), Phantom at (3,3) is adjacent (dist 1), allowing recalibrate. Foresight shows Wraith and Phantom are shadow_striking nearby — (0,3) and (0,4) are dangerous. Moving to (2,3) keeps me safer and positions me to recalibrate Phantom.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is at (3,0), distance 6 — out of my range 2. Orders say Pulse will move to (0,4) this turn, but that's already happened (pre-move phase). My valid moves show I can reach (3,4) or (4,3) etc. Pulse at (3,0) is distance 6, still out of range even after moving. No enemies are in range from current position. I should reposition to close distance while staying safe. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer to where Pulse might be. But orders say stay at maximum range and never move adjacent. With no enemies in range, I should move toward Pulse to get within range 2. From (3,4), Pulse at (3,0) would be distance 4 — still out of range. None of my moves will get me within range 2 of Pulse at (3,0). I'll move to (3,4) to close distance and wait for next turn.
  State: Pulse 1/14, Seer 3/6, Phantom 2/5, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Wraith, Prophet

### Turn 13 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(1,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals remaining — extremely fragile. No allies visible to overclock. All enemies are out of range. I should move away from enemies to survive as long as possible. Moving to (1,0) keeps distance from enemies at (3,3) and (3,4).
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 2HP, critically wounded. No enemies in range. Pulse is the only enemy left at (1,0) and is critical/retreating. Breach unavailable. My priority is survival. Allies Seer and Marksman are nearby to help finish Pulse. I should advance toward Pulse while staying safe. Moving to (2,1) puts me 2 tiles from Pulse and lets me use shadow_strike next turn if I can get adjacent. Moving to (3,1) is safer distance. Actually (2,2) gets me closer at dist 2-3 from Pulse. Let me move to (2,1) — dist from Pulse at (1,0) would be ~1-2 tiles, potentially in shadow_strike range next turn. Wait as second action since no ability targets available.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → recalibrate(2,1) ✓
  💭 Pulse is at distance 4 from current position (2,3) but marked as out of range for scan. I need to move closer. Moving to (2,2) or (1,1) would close distance. Pulse is predicted to move to (3,0), so I should anticipate that. From (2,0) Pulse would be at dist ~2. My ally Phantom is wounded at (2,1) — I could recalibrate them. Foresight shows Seer (me) moving to (2,3) then recalibrating (3,3) — but Phantom is at (2,1). Priority: recalibrate Phantom to buff them since they're wounded. Move to adjacent (2,2) to be adjacent to Phantom at (2,1), then recalibrate.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(0,4) ✗ No unit at target
  💭 Pulse is at (1,0) which is distance 6, out of my range 2. Orders say Pulse will move to (0,4) this turn. I need to reposition to get in range. Moving to (1,4) puts me distance 1 from (0,4) — too close, risk adjacency. Moving to (2,4) would put me distance 2 from (0,4) — exactly max range for precision_shot and not adjacent. But wait, (0,4) means x=0,y=4. From (2,4): dist = |2-0|+|4-4| = 2. That's within range 2 and not adjacent (not dist 1). However, precision_shot requires LoS. I'll move to (2,4) first, then attempt precision_shot on where Pulse will be at (0,4). Actually Pulse moves this turn before my action since I'm last in order — so Pulse should already be at new position. Let me move to (2,4) to get in range 2, then fire precision_shot at (0,4).
