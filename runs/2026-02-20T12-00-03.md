## Squads
### Player
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
### Opponent
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Doc** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,1) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Move north toward Bolt (the enemy striker/damage dealer) to close distance while invisible. Cloak first, then advance to (0,4) to get 3 tiles closer.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(2,4) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on my damage dealer if all healthy. Bolt is the striker (damage dealer) at (2,4), dist=2 from me at (4,4). I need to get adjacent to Bolt to use overclock. Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist=1 from Bolt at (2,4), making them adjacent. Then I can overclock Bolt to give them 2 abilities next turn.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. I should advance toward Bulwark to stay behind the sentinel for protection. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to the action while staying safe. No valid ability targets this turn.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Lifeline (enemy medic) is at (2,2), distance 2, in range. I'm at (2,4) not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is not blocked. With 2 ability uses I can fire precision_shot twice at Lifeline. I haven't moved so both shots deal 2 damage each — that's 4 total damage, enough to kill a healthy medic (3HP). Priority target: eliminate the enemy healer.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. I need to advance toward the front line to position between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to threats while staying near allies Bolt at (2,4) and Doc at (3,4). From there I can use shield_wall toward the south threats next turn. Wait as second action since no enemies are adjacent.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so I can't attack. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy (Bastion at 3,3 or Bolt at 2,4, both dist=4). Moving to (1,3) closes distance. Then shield_wall facing N where enemies are clustered (Bolt at 2,4, Doc at 3,4, Bastion at 3,3 all to the north).
  State: Veil 4/4, Bulwark 12/12, Lifeline 5/9, Bastion 12/12, Bolt 2/3, Doc 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is the priority target (damage dealer, striker). I can reach (2,5) which is behind Bolt — perfect for breach or shadow_strike. Moving to (2,5) gets me adjacent and behind. From there I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so I'm extremely vulnerable. Lifeline is wounded and in range at dist=2 - precision_shot can finish her for 2dmg if I don't move. Bulwark is healthy at dist=2. I should shoot Lifeline first to eliminate her (she could heal enemies), then move away to safety. Not adjacent to any Vector so precision_shot is available.
- **Doc** (medic): patch(4,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at 1/3 HP and critically wounded - top priority to heal. I'm at (3,4), Bolt is at (4,4). I need to move adjacent to Bolt to use patch. Moving to (4,3) or (3,4) staying - wait, Bolt is at (4,4) so I'm already adjacent (distance 1)! I can patch Bolt directly from my current position.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/9 HP which is critical - I need to heal myself. Wait, I'm a medic and patch heals allies, not self. I have 3/9 HP but patch only works on adjacent allies. No allies are adjacent (Bulwark is dist=2, Veil is dist=3). I should position behind Bulwark at (1,3) for protection. Moving to (1,2) puts me adjacent to Bulwark so I could overclock them next turn, and keeps me safe behind the sentinel. Enemies are not adjacent so no Vector block concern. I'll move toward Bulwark to get in healing/overclock position.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction. Bulwark is at (1,3) dist=2, not adjacent so can't attack. If I move to (2,3), I'll be adjacent to Bulwark and can attack. But moving loses Fortify. Better to advance to (2,3) to close distance and attack Bulwark, putting myself between enemies and allies Bolt@(4,4) and Doc@(4,3). Shield_wall west would protect allies from Bulwark's direction.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so I should stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Bastion first, then use shield_wall facing E where most enemies are (Bolt and Doc both to the east).
  State: Veil 4/4, Bulwark 11/12, Lifeline 3/9, Bastion 11/12, Bolt 3/3, Doc 9/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Priority target is Bolt (striker, damage dealer). I can move to (3,4) which is directly behind Bolt and adjacent — perfect for breach. This lets me control Bolt next turn while staying on priority target. Bolt at (4,4) facing E means (3,4) is behind them. I'll move there and breach immediately.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge. Allies are at (2,3) and (4,3). Veil is adjacent at (3,4). Moving to (5,5) gets me to the corner edge, away from allies. I'm adjacent to Veil so precision_shot is blocked by the Vector warning — actually that warning is about Vector units, not Veil. But Veil is a specter at dist=1 (adjacent), so I should check: precision_shot needs LoS and range≤2, but is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Veil is a specter, not a Vector, so precision_shot should work. However, orders say to move toward edge and away from allies — I'll move to (5,5) first, then fire at Veil from range 2 (dist would be sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, actually Manhattan dist from (5,5) to (3,4) = 2+1=3, out of range). From (5,4): dist to Veil (3,4) = 2, in range. Move to (5,4) — away from allies at (2,3)/(4,3), toward east edge. Then use precision_shot on Veil at (3,4) from dist=2.
- **Lifeline** (medic): patch(1,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/9 HP which is very low. Veil is at 3/4 (dist=4, not adjacent) and Bulwark is at 11/12 (dist=1, adjacent at 1,3). Bulwark is adjacent and wounded. I need to heal Bulwark with patch. Bastion enemy is at (2,3), dist=2 from me - not adjacent so patch is not blocked. I should stay safe and heal Bulwark who is right next to me.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at (2,3) dist=2, needs heal. I can move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Bastion (dist=1), then patch them. Veil is at (3,4) dist=2 from me, but after moving to (3,3) Veil would be adjacent - however patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not Specter, so I should be fine. Wait - the rule says patch blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector (the class). Veil is a Specter, so no block. Move to (3,3) to be adjacent to Bastion at (2,3), then patch Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) W ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) — attack it. I'm fortified so I want to stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Veil is at (3,4) threatening from the east/north side; my allies Bolt and Doc are nearby. After attacking Bulwark, use shield_wall facing West to block Bulwark's potential counterattack, or face East toward Veil. Actually, Bulwark is to my West at (1,3). Shield_wall W would protect against Bulwark. But I should attack first, then shield_wall W to reduce incoming from Bulwark's side.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Bastion, then use shield_wall facing East (toward Doc and Bolt cluster) to protect allies.
  State: Veil 3/4, Bulwark 11/12, Lifeline 3/9, Bastion 11/12, Bolt 3/3, Doc 9/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Priority target is Bolt (enemy striker, damage dealer). I can move to (4,4) which puts me behind Bolt and adjacent — perfect for shadow_strike which keeps cloak. Doc is adjacent now but orders say prioritize the striker. Move to (4,4) first, then shadow_strike Bolt from behind while staying cloaked.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → suppressing_fire(4,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge. I'm at (5,4) with Veil adjacent at (4,4). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — wait, that's Vector unit type, not relevant here. But Veil is a specter adjacent to me. I need to move away from allies (Bastion at 2,3 and Doc at 3,3) and toward the edge. Moving to (5,5) gets me to the corner edge, away from allies. Then I could use suppressing_fire on Veil at (4,4) to slow them, or precision_shot if not blocked. Veil is specter not Vector, so precision_shot isn't blocked. But I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg. Suppressing_fire hits a 2-tile line from target — useful to slow Veil. Move to (5,5) first, then suppressing_fire targeting Veil at (4,4).
- **Doc** (medic): patch(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so movement is reduced to 1. Bastion is adjacent at (2,3) with 11/12 HP - wounded and needs heal. I have 1 patch remaining. I should use patch on Bastion since they're adjacent. I can also move to stay in position. Bastion is already adjacent so I can patch them directly. Moving isn't necessary since Bastion is right next to me at (2,3).
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → patch(1,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is critically low at 2/4 HP but is 6 tiles away - unreachable. Bulwark is at 11/12 HP (barely wounded) and is dist=2. I need to move toward Bulwark to heal them, but they're only missing 1 HP so patch would be nearly wasted. Actually Veil at 2/4 is the priority but too far. Let me move to (1,3) to get adjacent to Bulwark and patch them - it's the only ally I can reach. Moving to (1,2) puts me dist=1 from Bulwark at (1,3). From (0,2) I can move to (1,2) then patch Bulwark at (1,3). Wait - Bulwark is only missing 1 HP, patch heals 2. Still worth it to keep sentinel healthy. Check enemy proximity: Bastion at (2,3) is dist=3 from me, so moving to (1,2) keeps me safe (Bastion can't reach adjacent). No enemies adjacent so patch won't be blocked.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) which I lose if I move, so staying put is ideal. Attack Bastion first, then use shield_wall facing E (toward Doc and Bastion cluster) to protect allies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) — attack it. I'm fortified so I'll use ability first, then stay put to keep Fortify active.
  State: Veil 2/4, Bulwark 11/12, Lifeline 3/9, Bastion 11/12, Bolt 2/3, Doc 8/9

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed (mv=1) and at 2HP. Priority is assassinating Bolt (enemy damage dealer) per orders. Bolt is at (5,5) facing N — I'm already behind them. I can move to (5,4) which is adjacent and behind Bolt, then use breach to take control of Bolt next turn, or shadow_strike for 1dmg. With 2HP I need to be careful. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Bolt. I'll shadow_strike Bolt — it keeps cloak if I have it (I'm not cloaked currently), does 1dmg. Actually shadow_strike range is adjacent only. If I move to (5,4) I'm adjacent to Bolt at (5,5). Then shadow_strike for 1dmg. Alternatively breach Bolt from behind — that would make Bolt obey me next turn, wasting their action. Breach is ready. Breaching Bolt from (5,4) behind them is very strong — removes the enemy striker for a turn. I'll move to (5,4) then breach Bolt.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Bastion is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded at 11/12. Bolt is wounded at 2/3 but far away (dist=4). I should stay near Bastion and use overclock on them since they're the most threatened adjacent ally and Bulwark is nearby threatening them. Moving to (2,2) or (2,4) keeps me adjacent to Bastion. I'll use overclock on Bastion to give them extra actions to deal with the nearby enemy threat.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → suppressing_fire(5,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies toward corner (5,0). Valid moves are [3,5],[4,4],[4,5],[5,3]. Veil is adjacent at (5,4) - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I should move toward (5,0) direction. (5,3) gets me closer to that corner while moving away from allies at (2,3)/(2,4). After moving to (5,3), Veil at (5,4) is still adjacent (dist=1), so precision_shot still blocked. Use suppressing_fire on Veil instead - 1dmg and slows, range ≤2 tiles, from (5,3) to (5,4) is dist=1, valid.
- **Lifeline** (medic): patch(1,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) with 3/9 HP and 1 heal remaining. Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) with 11/12 HP - only slightly wounded, not critical. Veil is at (5,4) with 1/4 HP - critically wounded but dist=6, unreachable. I should heal Bulwark since that's my only adjacent wounded ally and my last heal. Bastion enemy is at (2,3) dist=2 - if I stay at (1,2) or move to (1,3) I need to be careful about Vector adjacency rule (but Bastion is a sentinel, not Vector). I can safely patch Bulwark at (1,3). After healing, I should position safely - moving to (0,2) or (0,3) to stay behind cover.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) W ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) — attack it. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) and fortified (didn't move, 50% DR). Lifeline is at (0,2) to my west, threatening from that direction. Use shield_wall toward W to protect against Lifeline. Stay put to keep Fortify active.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent to my east. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified so I have damage reduction, but attacking means I can still use shield_wall too. Attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing east where Bastion and Doc are clustered.
  State: Veil 1/4, Bulwark 11/12, Lifeline 3/9, Bastion 9/12, Bolt 2/3, Doc 8/9

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(5,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, suppressed (movement 1), and Bolt is adjacent at (5,3) directly in front of me — I'm already behind Bolt (behindTiles confirms [5,4] = my position). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1dmg. Bolt is at healthy but if I shadow_strike for 1dmg that weakens them. However I have only 1HP — I need to be careful. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak, so I can strike and stay hidden. I can't move far due to suppression. Best play: shadow_strike Bolt (adjacent, I'm behind them), then move to (5,5) to reposition away from danger.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward corner (5,0). I'm at (5,3) with 1HP - very fragile. Veil is critical at (5,5) and in range, so I could finish them before moving. But orders say move away toward (5,0). Valid moves include (5,1) which gets me closer to the corner while staying on the x=5 column. I'll shoot Veil first with precision_shot (2dmg, critical enemy dies) then move to (5,1) toward the corner.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bolt is critically wounded at 1HP but dist=6, not reachable. Bastion is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded at 9/12HP. I should use overclock on Bastion to give them extra abilities, then stay in position. Bulwark is nearby at dist=2 — I need to be careful. Moving to (3,3) keeps me adjacent to Bastion while slightly away from Bulwark. Actually, staying at current position keeps adjacency to Bastion at (2,3). I can overclock Bastion from current position since they're adjacent.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → overclock(1,3) ✓
  💭 I have 0 heals remaining so patch is unavailable. I'm at 3/9 HP and wounded. Bulwark is at (1,3) adjacent distance 2 - not adjacent so I can't use overclock either without moving. No enemies are in range. I should move toward Bulwark to get adjacent for overclock, positioning safely. Moving to (1,2) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (1,3) and away from enemies. From (1,2) I can use overclock on Bulwark who as a sentinel can benefit from extra actions. But I'm at 3HP and overclock costs 1HP leaving me at 2HP - risky but Bulwark is healthy at 11/12. Actually with no heals left and being wounded myself, I should stay safe. Move to (0,3) to stay near Bulwark (dist 1) but not take overclock damage. Or move to (1,2) and use overclock on Bulwark at (1,3) to give them double actions - sentinels with extra moves/attacks are valuable. The orders say use overclock on allies who can do the most. Bulwark at 11/12 can handle it. I'll move to (1,2) then overclock Bulwark.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and overclocked (2 ability uses). Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3). I should attack Bulwark twice since I have 2 ability uses. Staying in place preserves Fortify bonus. Doc is behind me at (2,4) — no shield_wall needed right now. Double attack is optimal.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,3). I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) and fortify active. Orders say attack adjacent enemies and use shield_wall facing most enemies. Doc is at (2,4) N of Bastion, Bolt is far SE. Most enemies are to my East. Attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing East to block damage from Bastion/Doc direction.
  State: Bulwark 8/12, Lifeline 3/9, Bastion 7/12, Bolt 1/3, Doc 8/9 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 7 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward corner (5,0). I'm at (5,1) with 1HP — very fragile. Moving to (5,0) puts me in the corner, away from allies as ordered. No enemies in range so no ability use needed.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Bastion is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded at 7/12 HP. Bolt is critically low at 1/3 HP but far away (dist=7). I should use overclock on Bastion to maximize their output, then stay positioned. Bulwark is at (1,3) dist=2 from me, so not adjacent — overclock is not blocked. Bastion is adjacent to me at (2,3), so I can overclock them.
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(1,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) with 3/9 HP, no heals left. Bulwark is at (1,3) wounded at 8/12 HP and adjacent to me. I can't heal (0 uses left), but I can use overclock on Bulwark to give them 2 abilities next turn — very valuable since Bastion is right next to Bulwark at dist=2. Overclock costs me 1 HP (dropping to 2/9) but Bulwark getting 2 attacks on Bastion could finish it off. After overclocking, I should move away from danger since I'm very low HP. Move to (0,2) to get further from enemies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction and have 2 ability uses (overclocked). I should attack Bulwark twice to maximize damage on the wounded enemy while holding the front line. No need to move — staying fortified keeps my damage reduction active.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent to my east. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Doc is at (2,4) to my NE, Bastion at (2,3) to my E, Bolt far south. Most enemies are to my E/NE. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) and am fortified. I'll attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing E to block damage from Bastion/Doc direction. No need to move — staying put keeps Fortify active.
  State: Bulwark 5/12, Lifeline 3/9, Bastion 5/12, Bolt 1/3, Doc 8/9 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 8 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 7, out of my range 2. I'm at 1/3 HP so I need to close distance carefully. Moving to (3,0) gets me closer while staying on the south edge. Still won't be in range this turn, so I'll move as far as possible toward enemies and wait.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → overclock(1,3) ✓
  💭 I have 0 heals remaining so patch is unavailable. I'm at 3/9 HP and wounded. No enemies are in range from current position. Bulwark is at (1,3) dist=2, needs healing but I can't heal. I should move closer to Bulwark for positioning and use overclock on Bulwark who as a sentinel could benefit from an extra action. Moving to (1,2) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (1,3). From (1,2) I can use overclock on Bulwark. I need to check if any enemies would be adjacent after moving - Bastion is at (2,3) which would be dist=2 from (1,2), not adjacent, so overclock won't be blocked.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bastion is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded at 5/12 HP. I can use overclock on Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn, though it costs me 1 HP (8→7). Bulwark enemy is at dist 2 so not adjacent — overclock is not blocked. Staying near Bastion is the priority per orders.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with Bulwark adjacent at (1,3). I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and overclocked (2 ability uses). Orders: hold front line, attack adjacent enemies, use shield_wall toward threats. Bulwark is wounded and adjacent — I should attack it. With 2 ability uses from overclocked, I can attack twice. I should NOT move to preserve Fortify passive. Attack Bulwark at (1,3) twice.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked). Attack Bastion twice. Staying put preserves Fortify (50% damage reduction) since I'm at 2HP and need survivability.
  State: Bulwark 2/12, Lifeline 3/9, Bastion 2/12, Bolt 1/3, Doc 8/9 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 9 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,1) ✓ → precision_shot(1,2) ✓
  💭 At 1/3 HP I'm critical. No enemies in range at current position. Lifeline is wounded at dist=4, Bulwark critical at dist=5. I need to close to range 2 to use precision_shot. Moving to (2,1) gets me closer to both targets. From (2,1), Lifeline at (1,2) would be dist=2 — within range for precision_shot for a kill shot on wounded Lifeline.
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(1,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (2/9) with no heals left. Bulwark is also critical at (1,3). I can't heal anymore. Best option is to use overclock on Bulwark to give them extra actions, then position safely. Bulwark is adjacent to me at (1,3). I'll overclock Bulwark first, then move away from enemies to avoid death.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bastion is critically wounded at (2,3) adjacent to me - I'm at (2,4) so Bastion is directly south. Bulwark enemy is at (1,3), dist=2 from me. I should use overclock on Bastion to help them act more, but Bastion only has 2HP and is next to Bulwark. Actually, overclock costs Bastion 1HP which would put them at 1HP - risky but gives them 2 abilities. Alternatively, I can reposition. Bolt is at 1HP at (2,1), dist=3, can't reach. My best play: use overclock on Bastion at (2,3) to give them 2 abilities next turn so they can act or retreat - Bastion takes 1dmg going to 1HP but gets 2 actions. Then I could move to stay near Bastion. Actually Bastion at 2HP taking 1 more damage is very dangerous. Better to just wait or move to protect. I'll use overclock on Bastion since no heals left and they need to do something - 2 actions could let them attack+move away. Then wait.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✗ No unit at target
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,3) to my east. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. With OVERCLOCKED I get 2 ability uses. I'll attack Bastion twice. Staying put preserves FORTIFIED (50% dmg reduction) since I'm at 1HP and critical. Doc is to the northeast so shield_wall E or N could help but attacking Bastion to finish it off is priority.
  State: Bulwark 1/12, Lifeline 2/9, Bolt 1/3, Doc 8/9 | Dead: Veil, Bastion

### Turn 10 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(0,2) ✗ Out of range → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with 1HP - critical condition. Both enemies are critical too. Bulwark at (1,3) dist=3 and Lifeline at (0,2) dist=3 are both in range. I should use precision_shot to kill one of them. Lifeline is a medic - if she heals Bulwark it's bad. Kill Lifeline first to prevent healing. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I can stay put and shoot Lifeline, then wait or reposition.

  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bulwark is at (1,3) with 1HP, critically wounded, dist=2 so not adjacent. I'm at (0,2) with 2HP myself, very low. No enemies in range. I should move toward Bulwark to potentially overclock them (they're a sentinel who could benefit), but I can't heal. Moving to (1,2) gets me adjacent to Bulwark at (1,3), then I can overclock them so they get 2 abilities next turn - useful for a wounded sentinel. But overclock costs me 1HP, dropping me to 1HP which is risky. Alternatively just move closer and wait. Given Bulwark has only 1HP and is critically wounded, overclock would hurt them too (takes 1dmg = death). So overclock on Bulwark is off-limits. Best play: move toward safer position. Move to (1,2) to stay near Bulwark for support, then wait.

  💭 Bolt is critically wounded at 1/3 HP but patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bolt is at (3,1), dist=4, not adjacent. I need to move toward Bolt to support. Best move toward (3,1) is (3,3) which gets me to dist=2 from Bolt. No heals available, no adjacent allies to overclock. I'll move toward Bolt to stay near the most threatened ally.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) E ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 1HP, fortified. Doc is closest at dist=2 to my east at (3,3). Lifeline is critical at (1,2) behind me. I need to advance toward Doc (nearest enemy) and use shield_wall. Moving east toward Doc: (2,3) gets me closer. Then shield_wall facing E where enemies are concentrated (both Doc and Bolt are to the east).

- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → overclock(3,1) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bolt is wounded at (3,1) dist=2, not adjacent. Bulwark is adjacent at (2,3) and critical — enemy, so I can attack it. But my priority is supporting Bolt. I can move to (3,2) to get adjacent to Bolt at (3,1), then use overclock on Bolt to give him 2 abilities next turn — that could let Bolt deal more damage. However, Bulwark is adjacent now and I'm a medic with 1 attack damage. Better to move toward Bolt first, then overclock him since he's at 1HP and needs to act fast before dying.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) with 2HP - very low. No patch uses left. Bulwark is at (2,3) with 1HP, distance 2, not adjacent so I can't overclock them either. Doc enemy is at (3,2) distance 2, so not adjacent meaning overclock isn't blocked by Vector adjacency rule. I should move toward Bulwark to get adjacent for overclock next turn, but I need to stay safe. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to Bulwark at (2,3) - that would be adjacent! Then I can overclock Bulwark. But wait - Doc enemy is at (3,2), and if I move to (2,2) I'd be distance 1 from Doc at (3,2)... that's adjacent to an enemy medic (Doc). Actually Doc is a medic not a Vector, so the Vector adjacency block doesn't apply to me. I can overclock from (2,2) on Bulwark at (2,3). Bulwark at 1HP desperately needs help - giving them 2 abilities could let them attack or defend. Move to (2,2), then overclock Bulwark at (2,3).

  💭 I'm at 2/9 HP and critically low. Enemy Doc medic is adjacent at (3,2). Patch is unavailable (0 uses). I need to escape — move away from Doc to reduce risk. Overclock is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Doc is a medic not a Vector, so overclock might be usable. However, I should prioritize survival. Move away from Doc first, then consider overclock on an ally if possible.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → overclock(1,2) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No enemies in range to attack from current position. Lifeline is at dist=2, not adjacent. I'm at (3,2), Lifeline ally is at (1,2) - move toward them to stay adjacent. Move to (2,2) to get adjacent to Lifeline at (1,2). Then use overclock on Lifeline since patch is unavailable and I need to support the team.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Doc** (medic): attack(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Lifeline is enemy, not ally. No friendly wounded allies to help. I have overclock available but no adjacent friendly damage dealer to buff. Best action is to attack the adjacent enemy Lifeline to deal damage, then wait.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals left and an enemy medic adjacent. I need to survive. Moving away from Doc to avoid being finished off. No patch available, overclock is blocked while adjacent to enemy. Best option is to flee to create distance.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals left - I need to survive. Doc enemy is at dist 2, not adjacent so overclock isn't blocked, but I have no patch uses. I should move away from the enemy Doc to avoid getting killed. Moving to (0,4) keeps me away from Doc at (2,2).
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No enemies in range. Lifeline (enemy medic) is at dist=4, critical HP. Orders say stay adjacent to most threatened ally and use overclock on damage dealer if all healthy. I'm at (2,2). No allies listed as wounded. I should move toward the action and use overclock on a damage dealer if adjacent. No allies visible in range for overclock. I'll move toward (1,2) to reposition closer to the enemy medic and wait.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals left — extremely vulnerable. Doc enemy is at dist 3, not in range. No allies adjacent to overclock. I should move away from danger and position defensively. Moving toward (0,2) gets me closer to the enemy, bad. Moving to (2,4) or (1,5) keeps distance. I'll move to (1,5) to stay away from Doc at (1,2).
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Heals exhausted. Enemy Lifeline is at dist=3, critical HP. No enemies in range. I should move toward Lifeline to potentially use overclock or attack next turn. Moving from (1,2) toward (1,4) closes distance to 1.
