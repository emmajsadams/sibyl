That puts me at risk though. Alternatively, trap a tile they'll pass through. (4,5) is between me and both enemies - if I move there I'm adjacent to Bolt at (5,5) and Patch at (3,5), enabling a pulse hit on both. But moving adjacent to Patch enables their denial on me too... wait, I'm Vector so MY denial blocks their abilities. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to both - I can pulse both for 1 damage each. That's solid value. Risk: I'll be at 4HP adjacent to two enemies. But pulse first would be better - can I pulse from current position? No, enemies are at dist 2, pulse range is 1 tile.

Grid is at (4,5), so (4,4) is 1 tile away — that's adjacent, which blocks precision_shot via Vector denial. Move to (3,3) instead: dist to (4,5) = |4-3|+|5-3| = 1+2 = 3, still out of range. Move to (4,3): dist to (4,5) = 0+2 = 2, in range, not adjacent (dist=2). Vector denial is adjacent only. So (4,3) is safe and in range. Use precision_shot twice on Grid.",

Best play: use pulse now since Patch is at (5,4) which is adjacent-diagonal — actually dist=2 so not within 1 tile. Neither enemy is adjacent. I should try to escape or use trap to deter pursuit. Traps already at (3,4), (4,4) — good coverage south. Moving west to (3,5) gets me further from both enemies. Then trap at (4,5) my current tile to punish anyone following. Wait — trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy. Bolt is at (4,3) dist=2, Patch at (5,4) dist=2 — neither adjacent, so trap is allowed. Trap (4,5) after moving to create a deterrent on my old position, or trap (3,4) — already trapped. Let me move to (3,5) first, then trap (4,5) to cover my retreat path.",
