My previous attack went to (4,5) which is Veil's position — that seems like an error in foresight reading, Insight attacked toward (4,5)? Anyway, I need to be useful. Pulse is in range at dist 2 — already scanned, prompt known. I could attack Pulse (adjacent only, dist 2 = not adjacent). Scan requires ≤4 tiles and Pulse is dist 2 — but scan does 1dmg and reveals prompt (already known). I should recalibrate an ally or scan an unknown enemy. Ghost is unknown — last seen at (2,0) after moving there and shadow_striking. Ghost is out of range. I can move closer to scan Ghost, but at 2HP that's risky. Best play: move to (5,3) to get slightly closer to action while staying safer, then scan toward where Ghost might be — but Ghost at (2,0) is far. Alternatively, recalibrate Longshot at (4,0) — Longshot is adjacent from (5,1)? No, I'm at (5,4). Distance to Longshot (4,0) is too far for recalibrate (adjacent only). I should move toward Longshot to recalibrate, or just wait safely. With 2HP, I should move to (5,5) to avoid being caught, then wait. Actually Foresight showed Pulse moved to (5,5) — so (5,5) might have Pulse now. Move to (4,4) instead to stay safe, then scan Ghost's last known area (2,0) — dist from (4,4) to (2,0) is sqrt(4+16)=~4.5, out of range. Scan Bastion from (4,4)? Dist=3, in range, but already scanned. I'll move to (3,4) and scan Ghost's area — from (3,4) to (2,0) dist = sqrt(1+16)~4.1, still out.
