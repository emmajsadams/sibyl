Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Lattice — but breach from behind should work. Wait, the caution says Lattice is 2 tiles away and abilities are blocked when adjacent to Lattice (vector denial). So if I move to (4,2) I'd be adjacent to Lattice and breach would be blocked. I need to approach Hawk without triggering Lattice's denial. Let me move toward Hawk while staying clear of Lattice. Move to (3,3) keeps distance from Lattice (dist=1 from 4,3 — still adjacent, blocked). Move to (3,2) — dist from Lattice(4,3) = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still adjacent diagonally? Adjacent typically means 1 tile orthogonally. (3,2) to (4,3) is diagonal distance ~1.4, not adjacent orthogonally. I'll move to (3,3) to close on Hawk while staying cloaked.
