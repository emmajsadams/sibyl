Move to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Weaver at (2,3) and outside denial... wait, denial is based on adjacency to Vector. At (3,3) I'm adjacent to Weaver at (2,3), so still in denial. I need to get 2+ tiles away from Weaver. Move to (3,4) — Weaver at (2,3), dist= sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still adjacent diagonally? Dist=2 tiles Manhattan. That should escape denial. Then I can't shadow_strike from dist=2. Move to (4,4) — dist from Weaver=3, safe from denial. Cloak expires this turn anyway.

Best: move to (2,5) puts me at dist=2 from (0,5) — not adjacent, so denial doesn't apply. From (2,5) I can use pulse targeting myself to hit Lattice at (0,5)? No, pulse is 1-tile AoE from my position, and (0,5) is 2 tiles away. Can't reach with pulse. Attack is adjacent only. I can't kill Lattice this turn from any valid move without getting adjacent. Better to place a trap on Lattice's likely path. Lattice is at (0,5) heading north — nowhere to go on top row. It may move south or east. Trap at (1,5) could catch it moving east.
