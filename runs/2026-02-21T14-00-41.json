Tactically: Grid is at (4,3) facing E, and (3,3) is behind Grid and reachable. If I move to (3,3), I'd be behind Grid and adjacent — perfect for breach. But Grid is a vector, so if I'm adjacent, breach gets blocked. Wait — the caution says 'avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked.' So I cannot use breach if adjacent to Grid. But breach requires being behind and adjacent... that's the dilemma. Let me re-read: 'cloak/breach blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector.' So breach is blocked when adjacent to Grid. That means I can't breach Grid at all since breach requires adjacent positioning. Bastion is out of range at dist 4. No enemies in range currently. Best move: reposition away from Grid, stay safe.
