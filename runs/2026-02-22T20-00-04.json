I have two wounded enemies very close. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Ghost at (3,5) is 1 tile away, so pulse would hit Ghost. But I'm at 2HP, very fragile. Best play: pulse Ghost (1dmg, likely kills or finishes wounded Ghost), then move away to safety toward (1,5) or (0,5) to avoid retaliation. Actually, let me pulse first to hit Ghost (and possibly Bolt if they're close enough - Bolt is at distance 2 from me, won't be hit by pulse). Pulse targets my position's 1-tile radius. Ghost at dist 1 will be hit. Then move to (1,5) to create distance from Bolt and Lattice.",
