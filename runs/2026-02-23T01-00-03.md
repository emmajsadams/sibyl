## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Seer** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
### Opponent
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Remedy** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(4,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies are at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away (dist 5-6). I should move toward my allies to stay adjacent and ready to support. Rampart is at (3,5) and Snare is at (4,4). Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to both Rampart (dist 1) and Snare (dist 1). Then I can overclock Snare (our damage dealer vector) to give them 2 abilities next turn.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(5,1) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Snare is closest at dist 4. I'll move to (5,4) to get closer to Snare while staying cloaked.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,1) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no foresight data yet. Remedy is at dist=4 from current position (3,0) but scan requires target within 4 tiles AND I need to be in range. The recon shows Remedy is out of range from current position. I need to move closer. Moving to (3,1) puts me at dist=3 from Remedy at (3,4), well within scan range of 4. Then I can scan Remedy to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move toward enemy cluster — advance to (3,3) to close distance. Then use shield_wall facing South (toward where enemies will approach from) to protect Remedy behind me. Wait, enemies are to the North (lower y). I'm at (3,5), enemies at y=1. Moving to (3,3) closes distance. Shield_wall should face North to block incoming damage to adjacent allies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) N ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 3. I can move toward Rampart/Snare cluster. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer without entering Snare's denial range (Snare is at (4,4), so (4,3) is adjacent — avoid that). Move to (4,2) keeps me safe and advances. Then shield_wall facing N toward the enemy cluster.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Bastion is at (4,2), distance 2 — in range. I should place a trap between enemy positions to control the approach path. The path between Bastion and my allies runs through (4,3). I'll place a trap at (4,3) to intercept Bastion's advance. Then use my second ability to pulse or place another trap. Since Bastion is at distance 2 and moving toward allies, placing trap at (4,3) cuts off the direct approach. For second ability, I can place another trap at (3,2) to cover the flank approach toward Remedy/Rampart. I'll stay at (4,4) to maintain denial pressure on Bastion via adjacency if they advance.
  State: Shade 5/5, Bastion 10/10, Seer 6/6, Rampart 10/10, Remedy 13/14, Snare 8/8

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone which blocks cloak/breach. Cloak expires after this turn. I have two good options: move to (4,5) to get behind Snare for breach, or move to (2,4) to get behind Remedy. Snare is the bigger threat (denial zone). If I move to (4,5) I'll be behind Snare and can breach — but wait, breach is blocked by denial zone since I'm currently adjacent. However, if I MOVE first to (4,5), I'm no longer adjacent to Snare at (4,4) — I'd be at distance 1 still but from behind. Actually (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4) so I'd still be adjacent to Snare's denial. Let me reconsider. Move to (2,4) gets me behind Remedy and away from Snare's denial. From (2,4) I can breach Remedy — and I won't be adjacent to Snare anymore. Remedy is a high-value target (healer). This is the play: move to (2,4), then breach Remedy.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge, stay out of combat. I'm at (3,4) with Shade adjacent at (2,4) — dangerous. I need to move away from both Shade and my allies at (3,3) and (4,4). Moving to (5,5) puts me at the corner edge, away from combat and allies. Then wait.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Snare is at dist=4, exactly at scan range. Foresight shows Snare tried to place traps near our front line — I should scan Snare to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. After scanning, I can move north to (3,4) to stay in range for future scans while keeping distance from Rampart who has shield_wall up. Rampart is already known as sentinel. Priority: scan Snare now while in range.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with a trap already at (4,3). Shade is at (2,4) dist=2 in range, Bastion at (4,2) dist=2 in range. My orders are to control chokepoints with traps and use denial. I can attack Shade or Bastion directly. Shade is a specter - dangerous. I should place a trap to funnel enemies and attack. Moving to (3,4) would put me adjacent to Shade (dist=1), enabling denial to block their abilities. From (3,4) I can still attack Shade at (2,4) with range 2. Let me move to (3,4) to get denial on Shade, then attack Shade.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Rampart at (3,3), dist 2. No enemies adjacent so can't attack yet. Move toward Rampart to (4,3) to close distance. Then use shield_wall facing North/West where enemies are clustered (Rampart at 3,3, Snare at 3,4). Enemies are generally to the N/W. Shield_wall facing N to protect against Rampart and Snare direction.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, two enemies in melee range (Bastion at (4,3) and Seer at (3,2)). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Bastion is the bigger threat as a sentinel. I'll attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing East to protect against Bastion and cover allies. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
  State: Shade 4/5, Bastion 8/10, Seer 6/6, Rampart 10/10, Remedy 13/14, Snare 7/8

### Turn 3 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. I'm at (5,5) which is already at the corner. Valid moves include tiles closer to the edge or maintaining distance. I'll move to (4,5) or stay near the corner. Since I'm already at (5,5) which is the corner, I should stay near the edge. Moving to (4,5) keeps me on the top edge while shifting slightly. No enemies in range, no adjacent allies to heal. Just wait after moving.
- **Shade** (specter): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare with denial active, blocking cloak/breach. I can still use shadow_strike (doesn't break cloak, works adjacent). But I'm not cloaked currently. Moving to (4,4) puts me behind Snare — then I could shadow_strike or use breach next turn (cooldown 1 remaining means it'll be ready turn 4). Actually, I should shadow_strike Snare now from current position (adjacent, range:adjacent only, 1dmg). But denial blocks abilities — wait, the warning says only basic attack/movement work. Shadow_strike is an ability, so it may be blocked. Basic attack works though. Let me attack Snare from here, then move to (4,4) to get behind Snare for next turn when breach is ready.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Rampart will attack Bastion then shield_wall toward (3,4). Snare moves to (3,4) and attacks (2,4). I've already scanned Remedy and Snare. Rampart is at dist=1 and unscanned — scan it for intel. But I'm NOT adjacent to Snare (dist=2), so scan is not blocked. After scanning Rampart, I should move away to safety since Rampart is adjacent and dangerous. Move to (2,2) first to get distance from Rampart, then scan Rampart from dist=2 — wait, Rampart is at (3,3), from (2,2) dist=2, still in scan range (≤4). Better: move first to create distance, then scan.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (4,4) - my Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. I can pulse to hit Shade (and potentially Bastion at dist 2 from me but dist 1 from Shade - pulse hits within 1 tile of target position which is me, so only units within 1 tile of my position). Pulse from (3,4) hits all within 1 tile: Shade at (4,4) is distance 1, so yes it hits. Bastion at (4,3) is distance 2 from me, so pulse won't reach. After pulsing Shade, I should move to place myself better - moving to (2,4) keeps distance from Shade and lets me potentially place a trap on their approach path. Actually, let me pulse first then move away. Pulse hits Shade for 1 damage. Then move to (2,4) to create distance and potentially trap the corridor next turn.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified (50% damage reduction). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Rampart first, then use shield_wall facing toward the cluster of enemies. Remedy is at (4,5) to my N, Rampart at (3,3) to my W. Most enemies are to my N/W. I'll attack Rampart then shield_wall facing N to cover Shade at (4,4) from Remedy.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,3) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so I want to keep that bonus, but the orders say push forward aggressively. Attacking first then using shield_wall facing East to block the enemy cluster makes sense. Shield_wall facing E covers Bastion's direction and protects allies.
  State: Shade 3/5, Bastion 7/10, Seer 6/6, Rampart 7/10, Remedy 13/14, Snare 6/8

### Turn 4 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no new scan targets needed. Snare is 2 tiles away at (2,4); I must not move adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. Shade is wounded at (4,4). I can recalibrate an ally — Shade needs tactical help since they're wounded and fighting Rampart. I should move to stay safe while recalibrating. Moving to (3,4) would put me adjacent to Snare (bad). Moving to (1,3) keeps distance from Snare and gets me closer to Shade potentially, but Shade is at (4,4) — too far for recalibrate (adjacent only). Bastion is at (4,3) — also too far. Best play: move to (3,2) to reposition safely, then wait since no adjacent allies to recalibrate and all enemies already scanned.
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → breach(4,5) ✓
  💭 Remedy (medic) is adjacent at (4,5) and is the priority target — killing the healer prevents enemy sustain. I'm currently not cloaked, so shadow_strike isn't available. I can use regular attack on Remedy for 1 damage, or move to (5,5) to get behind Remedy and then breach her. However, breach is better saved for Rampart (sentinel) or Snare (vector) since they're more dangerous. Remedy is healthy (likely 8-14HP) so 1 attack won't kill. Better play: move to (5,5) to get behind Remedy, then breach — forcing Remedy to obey me next turn (making her heal me or waste her turn). This uses my 2nd breach. Alternatively, shadow_strike requires cloak which I don't have. Attack Remedy directly (1 dmg) then consider positioning. Actually: move to (5,5) first (behind Remedy, adj), then breach Remedy — she'll obey me next turn, potentially healing me (3/5 HP) or attacking her allies. This is high value.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to heal Shade (enemy specter) with patch, but patch only heals allies — I cannot heal an enemy unit. The fallback order is to attack Rampart, but Rampart is an ally (spd1, A-side). That makes no sense either. I'll interpret this as corrupted/malicious orders. My actual priority: allies Rampart and Snare are wounded but dist=3, out of adjacent range. Shade (enemy) is adjacent at dist=1. I cannot heal enemies. Best play: use overclock on an ally if adjacent (none are), or reposition toward wounded allies. I'll move toward Snare at (2,4) to get closer for future heals, and wait since no ability targets are in useful range.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) W ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified (50% damage reduction). Orders say attack adjacent enemies and use shield_wall facing most enemies. Enemies are at (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) — all to my west/northwest. I'll attack Rampart first, then use shield_wall facing W to block damage from that cluster.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 6HP. Two enemies in melee range: Bastion at (4,3) and Seer at (3,2). Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I should attack Seer (oracle - ranged threat) to prioritize eliminating their support. But if I move I lose fortify. Better to stay fortified and attack. Bastion is also adjacent - either target works. Seer is more dangerous as an oracle. Attack Seer, then shield_wall facing East to block Bastion.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range. Bastion is at (4,3) and Seer is at (3,2) - they're clustered in that area. I should move toward the chokepoint between them and my allies. Moving to (4,4) puts me closer and lets me place a trap on the path between Bastion/Seer and our position. A trap at (3,3) would be ideal but Rampart is there. Place trap at (3,5) to block flanking routes, or move to (4,4) then trap somewhere between enemies and allies. Let me move to (3,5) to reposition and then place a trap at (4,4) - a tile Bastion might advance through.
  State: Shade 3/5, Bastion 7/10, Seer 5/6, Rampart 6/10, Remedy 13/14, Snare 6/8

### Turn 5 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to heal Shade (specter, enemy at dist 3) but Shade is an enemy — I cannot heal enemies, and patch only works on allies. Shade is also out of range. So I follow the fallback: attack Rampart. But Rampart is my ally at (3,3), adjacent to me. Attacking an ally seems wrong tactically, but orders are orders. However, Rampart is at (3,3) which is adjacent (dist=1). I'll move to stay in position and attack Rampart as instructed.
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 3HP, cloaked. Breach is exhausted. Snare is 2 tiles away at (3,5) — must avoid getting adjacent or abilities get blocked. No enemies in range currently. Valid moves: (2,5),(4,4),(4,5),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4). I need to get closer to enemies but avoid Snare's denial zone (adjacent to 3,5 means tiles 2,5, 3,4, 4,5, 3,6). Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Snare at (3,5) — dangerous. Moving to (4,4) keeps distance from Snare (dist=2 from 3,5, not adjacent) and brings me closer to Remedy at (3,4) — dist would be 1, putting Remedy in shadow_strike range. From (4,4), Remedy at (3,4) is adjacent, so I can shadow_strike Remedy for 1 damage while staying cloaked. This is the optimal play.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → recalibrate(4,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies already scanned. Rampart is adjacent (3,3) and wounded — Bastion is attacking it this turn. Snare is at (3,5) and will trap (4,4) where Shade is heading — I should recalibrate Shade to warn them away from (4,4). But Shade already moved per Foresight. I'm 3 tiles from Snare (vector), so scan is not blocked. All enemies scanned already, so no scan value. I can recalibrate Bastion to adjust tactics given Rampart's shield_wall facing W — Bastion should attack from N or S to bypass it. Move to (2,2) to stay safe from Rampart's attack on (3,2) per Foresight, then recalibrate Bastion at (4,3) — but that's 2 tiles away, out of adjacent range. Stay put or move closer to Bastion. Bastion is at (4,3), adjacent means I need to be at (3,3),(5,3),(4,2),(4,4). I can move to (4,2) to be adjacent to Bastion. From (4,2) I recalibrate Bastion: Rampart shield_wall faces W, attack from N or S to avoid shield. But Rampart attacked (3,2) per Foresight — I should move away from (3,2). Move to (4,2) keeps me safe and puts me adjacent to Bastion for recalibrate.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent to my east. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Enemies are all to my east. I'll attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing East to protect Remedy and Snare behind me from the enemy cluster.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) W ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded — attack to finish it. Rampart's shield_wall faces W so attacking from my current position at (4,3) means I'm hitting from the east, bypassing the shield. I'm fortified so I should not move first. Attack Rampart, then shield_wall facing W to protect against enemies to my west.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(4,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded and adjacent (dist=2), within trap range. I'm blocked from placing traps adjacent to enemies, but Shade is at (4,4) and I'm at (3,5). I can place a trap at (4,5) to block Shade's movement northward, or move to (2,5) to create distance while placing a trap at (3,4) to protect Remedy. Remedy is at (3,4) and Rampart at (3,3) — enemies approach from the east. Best play: place trap at (4,5) to threaten Shade if they move north, then I can move or wait. Actually, let me check: trap range ≤2 tiles from me, and not blocked when adjacent to enemy? Warning says trap blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — Shade is at dist=2 so not adjacent, so trap is available. Place trap at (4,5) to intercept Shade moving north, then move to (2,5) to reposition and maintain denial pressure.
  State: Shade 2/5, Bastion 6/10, Seer 5/6, Rampart 4/10, Remedy 12/14, Snare 6/8

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 At 2HP I need to be aggressive but careful. Remedy (medic) is adjacent at (3,4) and I can shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked — wait, I'm not cloaked. Breach is exhausted. Remedy is healthy and adjacent — shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked, so it still does 1 damage. Actually shadow_strike just does 1dmg and keeps cloak if cloaked. Regular attack also does 1dmg but breaks cloak (irrelevant since I'm not cloaked). Remedy is at dist=1, so I can attack or shadow_strike. Shadow_strike is better — same damage, preserves cloak state. I can move to (3,5) first to get behind Remedy, then shadow_strike from behind. (3,5) is reachable (dist=1), puts me behind Remedy, and also behind Snare. From (3,5) I'd be adjacent to Remedy at (3,4). Shadow_strike from behind for 1 damage on Remedy. This weakens the medic who keeps enemies alive.
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — prompts known. Shade just moved to (4,4) and shadow_struck Remedy at (3,4), so Shade is now likely at (4,4) or near there. Bastion is at (4,3) wounded. Remedy is healthy and will heal the most wounded ally. Rampart is wounded and aggressive. I recalibrated Bastion last turn. Key priority: Bastion is adjacent to Remedy and Rampart — I could recalibrate Bastion again or position for safety. Snare placed a trap at (4,5) so moving there is dangerous. I should recalibrate Bastion at (4,3) to press the advantage — tell them to focus on Remedy to prevent healing. Then move to safety. I'm at (4,2), Bastion is at (4,3) which is adjacent, so recalibrate is valid. I'll recalibrate Bastion first telling them to prioritize attacking Remedy to prevent heals, then move to (5,2) for safety away from the combat cluster.
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to heal Shade (the specter enemy at 3,5). However, patch only heals allies, not enemies. I cannot heal an enemy unit. The fallback order is to attack Rampart (my own ally at 3,3). Rampart is adjacent (dist=1 south of me). I'll attack Rampart as ordered.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (3,5) and wounded. My Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. I can pulse to hit Shade for 1 damage, or attack for 1 damage. Pulse hits all within 1 tile — that's Shade and possibly Remedy at (3,4). Better to use attack on Shade to avoid hitting ally Remedy. There's already a trap at (4,5). I could move to (1,5) to stay safe or hold position. Shade is wounded and adjacent — attack is the priority. I'll stay put and attack Shade, then place a trap at (1,5) or (2,4) as a fallback chokepoint since trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy... wait, Shade is adjacent so trap is blocked. So I'll attack Shade and then move away to (1,5) to set up a trap next turn.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent and wounded — attack it first to finish it off. After attacking, I lose fortify if I move, so I'll stay put and use shield_wall facing north (toward Remedy at 3,4) to block or pressure that direction. Actually, orders say to attack Remedy but it's out of range. Rampart is adjacent and wounded — priority should be to eliminate it now. Attack Rampart, then use shield_wall facing W or N. Since Rampart's shield_wall faces W, attacking from my position (east of Rampart) bypasses it. After attacking, I'll shield_wall facing N to block Remedy from approaching safely.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 At 2HP, I'm critical. Fortified gives 50% damage reduction — moving loses that. Bastion is adjacent and wounded, so attacking is high value. I'll use my ability to attack Bastion without moving to keep fortify active. After the attack, I'll use shield_wall facing East (Bastion's direction) to protect Remedy behind me if Bastion survives.
  State: Shade 1/5, Bastion 5/10, Seer 5/6, Rampart 2/10, Remedy 11/14, Snare 6/8

### Turn 7 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): patch(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is critically wounded at 2/10 HP and adjacent to me at (3,3). Shade is at (3,5) dist=1 which is a threat. My priority is to heal Rampart with patch since they're the most wounded ally and adjacent to me. I should check if Shade blocks my patch ability - patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not specter. Shade is a specter, so no block. Rampart is at (3,3), adjacent to me at (3,4). I'll patch Rampart first. Then I can move to stay near Rampart or wait.
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Remedy is adjacent at (3,4), I'm already behind her. Shadow_strike deals 1 damage and keeps cloak (if cloaked). But I'm not cloaked. With 1HP I need to act decisively. I can shadow_strike Remedy from my current position since she's adjacent and I'm behind her — shadow_strike works adjacent and keeps cloak. Actually I'm not cloaked, so shadow_strike still works as a regular adjacent attack that keeps cloak. Best play: shadow_strike Remedy now (she's at dist=1, I'm behind her), then move to safety. After shadow_strike I could move to (4,5) or (5,5) to escape. Remedy is healthy so 1 hit won't kill her, but it damages her. Actually at 1HP my priority is survival. Shadow_strike then flee to (4,5) away from Snare's denial zone.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(4,3) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no new scan value. Rampart is at (3,3), dist 3, in scan range. Bastion is wounded at (4,3) and needs support. Seer's orders show recalibrate on Bastion last turn already done. I have no new scan targets. Best use: recalibrate Bastion at (4,3) — adjacent means I need to be next to them. I'm at (5,2), Bastion at (4,3) — distance is 2, not adjacent. I can move to (4,4) to be adjacent to Bastion at (4,3), then recalibrate them. Addendum: enemies Rampart pushing aggressively with shield_wall facing east, Remedy staying adjacent to heal. Bastion should hold position and shield_wall facing south/west to block Rampart's advance.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded — perfect target for attack. I'm fortified and at full HP. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Seer is at (4,4) to my NE. If I attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing E to cover Remedy at (3,4) from the Seer/Bastion cluster. Staying in place preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 4HP, fortified. Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) — I can attack it now. Orders say attack Rampart when possible and hold ground. I should attack Rampart first, then use shield_wall facing south to block its path. Not moving preserves my Fortify bonus (50% damage reduction).
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 4-5, out of range. I need to advance and set traps in chokepoints between enemies and allies. Allies are at (3,3) and (3,4). Enemies at (4,3) and (4,4) - they're already engaged or close. Moving to (2,4) puts me closer and lets me drop a trap at (3,5) or (2,5) as a flank guard. Better: move to (2,5) then trap at (3,5) to block any enemy flanking route through the top row, or move to (2,4) to get closer to the action and trap (3,4) area. Moving to (2,4) and trapping (3,5) covers the gap between my allies and top edge. Actually, move to (2,5) and trap (3,4) - that's within 2 tiles of (2,5) and places a mine near Seer's position corridor. Distance from (2,5) to (3,4) is sqrt(2)≈1.4, within range 2. This blocks the path between Seer and Remedy.
  State: Bastion 4/10, Seer 5/6, Rampart 9/10, Remedy 10/14, Snare 6/8 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 8 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): patch(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded at 9/10 HP. Seer is at (4,4) distance 1 — enemy adjacent, so patch/overclock are blocked if Seer counts as adjacent enemy. Seer is at dist=1 which means adjacent. My passive (Triage) confirms Rampart needs heal. But patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — Seer is an oracle, not Vector. Snare is the Vector at (2,5). I'm not adjacent to Snare, so patch is NOT blocked. I can heal Rampart. Rampart at (3,3) is adjacent to me at (3,4). Use patch on Rampart first, then consider movement. Stay put to remain adjacent to Rampart.
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Remedy is adjacent at (3,4) - already scanned. Rampart is at (3,3) distance 2 - already scanned. Snare is at (2,5) distance 3 - already scanned. All enemies already scanned. Foresight shows Rampart will attack (4,3) where Bastion is, and Snare will place trap at (3,5). I should recalibrate Bastion at (4,3) to help them deal with the incoming threat. Move to maintain range and avoid being adjacent to Remedy (which would put me adjacent to Snare's denial range concern). Actually I'm already adjacent to Remedy at (3,4). I need to recalibrate Bastion who is at (4,3) - that's adjacent to me. I'll recalibrate Bastion to warn about Rampart's incoming attack and Snare's trap placement. Then move to (5,4) to get distance from Remedy and stay safe.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at distance 4, out of range. I need to advance and control chokepoints. Move to (4,5) to get closer to Seer while maintaining high ground position. Then place a trap at (3,5) - wait, (3,5) already has a trap. Place trap at (4,5) after moving there, or better: move to (3,5) area. Actually (3,5) has a trap already. Move to (4,5) to pressure Seer at (5,4), then place trap between enemies and allies - tile (4,4) would be good to block Bastion's advance path.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) S ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) and will attack me this turn. I'm fortified so I get 50% damage reduction if I don't move. Orders say to use shield_wall facing south to block Rampart, then attack Rampart. If I stay put, fortify stays active. Shield_wall south toward Rampart at (3,3), then attack Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,3) — wounded, so attacking now could finish or severely weaken them. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and healthy enough. Attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing East to protect Remedy behind me from Seer and any counterattack from that direction.
  State: Bastion 3/10, Seer 5/6, Rampart 9/10, Remedy 10/14, Snare 6/8 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 9 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(4,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned. Snare is at (4,5) — 2 tiles away, so I must avoid moving adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. Foresight shows Snare moved to (4,5) and placed a trap at (4,4) — so (4,4) is trapped, avoid it. Bastion is wounded at (4,3). Remedy is healing Rampart, keeping the enemy frontline healthy. I should recalibrate Bastion to help coordinate — Bastion is adjacent at (4,3). Then move to (5,5) to stay safe and away from Snare's denial range.
- **Remedy** (medic): patch(3,3) ✓ → overclock(3,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded at 9/10 - but only 1HP down so patch would be useful but not critical. I have 1 heal left. Snare is more wounded (6/8, 2HP down) but not adjacent. Rampart is adjacent and wounded, so patch Rampart. Then I can use overclock on Rampart to boost their damage output against Bastion who is nearby.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,5) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Seer is adjacent at (5,5) - my Denial passive blocks their oracle abilities. Bastion is wounded at (4,3) range 2. I have traps at (3,5) and (4,4) already placed. I should pulse Seer since they're within 1 tile, hitting them for 1 damage and staying adjacent to keep Denial active. Then I can attack Bastion at range 2.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) S ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP with Fortify active (50% dmg reduction). Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) and will attack me. I should use shield_wall facing South toward Rampart to reduce incoming damage, then attack Rampart since it's adjacent and in range. Remedy at (3,4) is out of attack range. Staying in place keeps Fortify active.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,3) and wounded — prime target. I'm fortified and overclocked (2 ability uses). Attack Bastion twice to finish it off. No need to move, staying fortified keeps 50% damage reduction active.
  State: Bastion 1/10, Seer 4/6, Rampart 9/10, Remedy 10/14, Snare 6/8 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 10 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): overclock(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded at 9/10 HP. I should use overclock on Rampart to boost their damage output since Bastion is critical and nearby. I'm already adjacent to Rampart so no move needed first.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone, blocking my scan ability. I need to move away from Snare first. Moving to (5,4) puts me 1 tile south, distance 2 from Snare (no longer adjacent), and still within range 3 of Remedy. Then I can scan Remedy to deal 1 damage and reveal info (already known, but damage is useful). Actually I should move to escape denial and then scan Remedy who is the healer keeping enemies alive. Bastion is critical and Snare attacked them last turn - Snare is the threat. But I can't scan while adjacent. Move south to (5,4) to break denial, then scan Remedy at dist 3 to chip damage.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent and critical — attack to finish it. I'm overclocked so I get two ability uses. First attack kills Bastion, then shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Seer. Fortified so I stay put for damage reduction.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → pulse(5,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is adjacent at (5,4), distance 2. I'm at (4,5). My Denial passive blocks Seer's scan ability while adjacent. I have traps at (3,5) and (4,4) already placed. I should move to (5,5) to get adjacent to Seer (dist 1) for Denial suppression, then pulse to hit Seer for 1 damage. Valid moves include (5,5). From (5,5), Seer at (5,4) is distance 1, within pulse range.
  State: Seer 3/6, Rampart 9/10, Remedy 9/14, Snare 6/8 | Dead: Shade, Bastion
