Orders say attack enemy Wraith or Grid - but I see no Wraith listed as enemy; Wraith is an ally. Grid is an ally too. The orders seem confused. Given my critical HP, I should prioritize damage output. Enemy Marksman at (4,2) is wounded - finishing them is best. I'll move to (4,1) to get adjacent to enemy Marksman, then attack for 1dmg to potentially finish them. Or stay and use suppressing_fire on Marksman at (4,2) from current position (dist=2, in range) to deal 1dmg to the line. Suppressing_fire from (3,1) targeting (4,2) direction E would hit (4,2) and (5,2). That deals 1dmg to Marksman and slows them. Better: move to (4,1) first, then attack Marksman at (4,2) adjacent for 1dmg.",

I can't place traps adjacent to enemy, but Grid is at dist 2 so I'm safe to trap. (4,3) or (5,3) are already trapped. Let me check open tiles near Grid's likely movement paths. (4,5) is trapped already. Moving to (3,4) to maintain safe distance while placing a trap on (4,5)... wait (4,5) is already trapped. I'll stay at (4,4) and place a trap on (3,5) which is unoccupied and on a likely movement path if Grid moves west.",
