## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
### Opponent
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (min dist 6, scan range 4). I need to advance north to get within scan range. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying behind my front line. No scan targets in range yet, so I'll move twice effectively by moving to max northern position available.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are far away (dist 4-7), no one adjacent to block cloak. After cloaking, move north toward enemy lines to close distance. Marksman at (2,4) is closest at dist 4, facing S — behind tile is (2,5). I'll move to (2,3) to advance while cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Orders say to cloak first turn. I'll cloak then advance toward enemy lines using my move3. Moving to (1,2) gets me closer to both enemies while staying off the flanks.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is in range at dist=3 from current position. No enemies are wounded yet, so target the enemy oracle (Prophet) as priority. I have not moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Stay at current position to maintain max range and avoid closing on enemies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemies are 4-5 tiles away, out of range. I need to advance to hold the front line between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,4) puts me ahead of Marksman at (2,4) and Ghost at (1,3), positioning between allies and the threats from the south. No enemies in range to attack yet.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 I need to advance toward the front line to position between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,3) puts me directly between my allies at (2,3)/(4,3) and the enemies at (3,4)/(2,4). This is within my move range of 2. Once there, I'll be adjacent to Warden at (3,4) — no, dist=3 means Warden is at (3,4) and I'd be at (3,3), that's distance 1, so adjacent. Wait, current pos is (3,1), move to (3,3) is 2 tiles north — valid. From (3,3), Warden at (3,4) is adjacent, so I can attack.
  State: Aegis 8/8, Veil 4/4, Prophet 6/6, Warden 7/8, Ghost 4/4, Marksman 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — must use it now or lose the advantage. Marksman is adjacent at (2,4) facing S, so (2,5) is directly behind them and reachable. I can move to (2,5) to get behind Marksman, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This preserves cloak for potential follow-up and avoids wasting breach on a non-priority target.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent to Aegis and was attacking last turn. Marksman tried to precision_shot me but failed. Ghost and Veil are cloaked specters moving toward our lines - Ghost at (1,3), Veil at (2,3). I should scan Warden to reveal its prompt and deal damage, since Warden is the immediate threat to Aegis at dist=2. Then move north to (4,4) to maintain range advantage and avoid being adjacent to enemies.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn, so I need to use it now. I can reach (3,2) which is directly behind Aegis (facing N, so south side). From there I'm adjacent and behind — perfect for breach. Move to (3,2) then breach Aegis to take control of a healthy sentinel.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are healthy, so no wounded targets to secure kills on. No enemy medic present. Veil is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks precision_shot per the Vector warning - wait, Veil is a specter not a Vector. The warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector class. Veil is a specter, so precision_shot should still work. However, I need to stay at maximum range and never move adjacent to enemies. Veil at (2,5) is dist=1, which is adjacent - I should move away from Veil while staying in range of targets. Moving to (1,4) keeps me at range from enemies and away from Veil. From (1,4): Aegis at (3,3) would be dist=sqrt(4+1)~2.2 tiles - may be out of range 2. Let me check: precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Distance from (1,4) to (3,3) = sqrt((3-1)^2+(3-4)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.24 - out of range. Distance from (1,4) to (2,5) = sqrt(1+1) = ~1.41 - in range. Distance from (1,4) to (4,4) = sqrt(9+0) = 3 - out of range. So from (1,4) only Veil is in range. Stay at current position (2,4) - Aegis and Prophet are both at dist=2 and in range. Veil is at dist=1 but is a specter not Vector, so precision_shot works. Target Prophet (oracle) as the highest priority non-medic, or Aegis. No medic present. All are healthy. I'll use precision_shot on Prophet at (4,4) - important enemy class. But I haven't moved so no 1dmg penalty. Actually precision_shot does 2dmg normally. I'll stay and shoot Prophet.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies toward the edge to isolate. Allies are at (2,5) and (4,4). Valid moves include (5,3) which moves east away from both allies and toward the edge. I'll move to (5,3) then wait - no ability needed since the goal is repositioning.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (4,4) — attack it. Stay put to keep Fortify active and maintain 50% damage reduction since I'm at 6/8 HP.
  State: Aegis 8/8, Veil 4/4, Prophet 4/6, Warden 6/8, Ghost 4/4, Marksman 3/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): breach(2,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Marksman (I'm at 2,5, they face S, so I'm behind them). I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked, then use breach on Marksman to control them next turn — they're isolated and adjacent. Breach requires being behind enemy, which I am. Actually, let me prioritize: shadow_strike keeps cloak, breach is more powerful. I'll breach Marksman first (I'm already behind them at 2,5, they're at 2,4, dist=1, behind=true). Breach makes them obey me next turn — very powerful. Save shadow_strike for after. Actually order matters: I can move then ability or ability then move. I'm already in position. I'll shadow_strike first to deal damage while staying cloaked, then breach — wait, can I use two abilities? No, only one ability per turn. Choose: breach is stronger (control) vs shadow_strike (1 dmg, keeps cloak). Breach cooldown is ready, 0/2 used. Breach the Marksman — they're the highest speed enemy and most dangerous adjacent threat. I'm behind them, adjacent, so breach works.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown for 1 more turn. I'm uncloaked at (3,2). Veil is at (2,3) distance 2 — no behind tile reachable. Aegis at (5,3) and Prophet at (4,4) both have (4,3) as a behind tile. Moving to (4,3) puts me behind BOTH Aegis and Prophet simultaneously — excellent positioning. Next turn breach will be available. I'll move to (4,3) to set up a breach on Aegis or Prophet next round. No ability this turn since I can't reach any enemy adjacently from (4,3) after moving, and shadow_strike requires adjacent.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → scan(4,3) ✓
  💭 Critical situation: I'm at 4HP, Ghost is adjacent at (4,3) and Marksman just precision_shot me. Ghost will breach next turn — I need to escape. Warden is already scanned. Ghost and Marksman still need scanning. Ghost is adjacent which blocks scan (WARNING: scan blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — but Ghost is a specter, not Vector class). Wait — the warning says 'Vector' class specifically. Ghost is a specter, so scan should work. But Ghost is at dist=1, and scan requires ≤4 tiles, so Ghost is in range. However, I'm in danger here with two enemies adjacent/near. Best play: move to (5,4) to break adjacency with Ghost, then scan Marksman at (2,4) dist=2 from new position... wait, from (5,4) Marksman at (2,4) would be dist=3, still in scan range. Actually let me reconsider: move to (4,5) to get away, but that's not in valid moves list. Valid moves include (5,4) and (4,5) — (4,5) is valid. From (4,5), Ghost at (4,3) is dist=2, Marksman at (2,4) is dist=3, both scannable. Moving to (4,5) gets me away from Ghost's breach range next turn. Then scan Ghost to get intel on the specter before it cloaks.
- **Marksman** (striker): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (2,3) - too close for precision_shot. Orders say move toward Ghost at (3,2). I can move to (3,3) to close on Ghost and get distance from Veil, then use precision_shot on Veil from range 1... wait, precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy. From (3,3), Veil at (2,3) is distance 1 - still adjacent. Let me move to (2,2) instead - Veil at (2,3) would be distance 1 still adjacent. Move to (3,3): Veil dist=sqrt(1+0)=1, adjacent, blocked. Best play: use attack on Veil now while adjacent (1dmg), then move to (3,3) toward Ghost.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say to move away from allies toward the edge. I'm at (5,3) facing E, already near the east edge. Ghost is adjacent at (4,3). I should move to isolate myself per orders — moving to (5,4) or (5,5) gets me toward the edge corner. But Ghost is right next to me and I'm fortified (50% DR if I don't move). However orders explicitly say to move. I'll attack Ghost first while adjacent (free damage), then move to edge. Ghost is at dist=1 so attack is valid. Then move to (5,5) to push toward corner/edge as ordered.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with fortify active (50% DR). Veil is at (2,3) dist=2, threatening Ghost at (4,3) and Marksman at (3,3). I need to position to intercept threats to allies. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Veil at (2,3) for an attack next turn and shields the western flank. Alternatively, staying put keeps fortify but no enemies are adjacent. Veil is the closest threat at dist=2 - I should advance toward it to engage and protect Marksman. Move to (2,4) to close distance, then shield_wall South to protect Marksman from Veil.
  State: Aegis 8/8, Veil 3/4, Prophet 4/6, Warden 6/8, Ghost 2/4, Marksman 3/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(4,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (4,5) facing N, and (4,4) is directly behind them and reachable in 1 move. I'm at (4,3) with 2HP — I need to act offensively. Move to (4,4) to get behind Prophet, then use breach to take control of them. This is a high-value target (oracle) and breach is ready. Using breach here removes Prophet from enemy control for a turn and potentially sets up a follow-up kill.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) uncloaked with 3HP. Breach is on cooldown. Warden is adjacent at (2,4) facing W, Marksman is adjacent at (3,3) facing S. Both are in range for shadow_strike. Ghost is wounded at (4,4) - high priority target but out of range. I can move to (3,4) which is behind both Warden AND Marksman (both face that direction as their behind tile). From (3,4) I can shadow_strike either. Marksman (striker) is higher priority target - more dangerous than sentinel. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Marksman from behind. I'll move to (3,4) then shadow_strike Marksman at (3,3) - dealing 1 damage while staying stealthy if I'm cloaked... but I'm not cloaked. Shadow_strike still works uncloaked, just deals damage. Actually I should shadow_strike for 1dmg. Marksman is healthy and more of a threat. Let me move to (3,4) and shadow_strike Marksman.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and in scan range at dist=3. Scanning reveals prompt and deals 1 damage — could finish or weaken. Ghost is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded, but scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... Ghost is a specter, not Vector, so scan should work. However, orders say move toward Aegis or away from allies to isolate. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Ghost (wounded) and closer to Marksman for next scan. Actually, I should scan Marksman now (dist=3, in range) for the intel + damage, then move. Marksman at (3,3) is wounded — scanning deals 1 damage and reveals prompt. From (4,5), Marksman is at dist=3 which is ≤4, so scan is valid. Ghost is adjacent but Ghost is a specter not a Vector, so scan isn't blocked. Scan Marksman first, then move to (4,3) to follow orders and pressure enemies.
- **Marksman** (striker): suppressing_fire(3,4) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 1HP - critically low. Veil is adjacent at (3,4) and Prophet at (4,3). Orders say move toward Ghost at (3,2). I need to move away from threats. Both enemies are adjacent, which means precision_shot is blocked by Vector rules if adjacent. I can use suppressing_fire or attack. At 1HP I must prioritize survival. Moving to (3,2) gets me toward Ghost and away from Veil. I should fire at one of the adjacent enemies before moving, or move first. If I move first, I lose LoS on current targets potentially. Better to fire then move. Suppressing_fire on Veil at (3,4) would deal 1dmg and slow them, helping me escape. Then move to (3,2) to reach Ghost's position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies toward the edge to isolate Aegis. Current position is (5,5) which is already at the top-right corner. Valid moves are [3,5],[4,5],[5,3],[5,4]. Moving to (5,4) or (5,3) keeps me on the right edge and moves away from allies at (3,4) and (4,3). Moving to (5,3) gets me further from Veil at (3,4) and closer to isolating myself on the east edge. Ghost is at (4,4) dist=2, so moving to (5,3) also distances from Ghost slightly. I'll move to (5,4) first then (5,3) if possible — but I only have mv2 total. I can move to (5,3) in one move (dist=2 from 5,5). That puts me on the east edge, away from allies, isolated. Then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (3,4) - I can attack for 1 damage. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Veil first, then stay put to maintain fortify.
  State: Aegis 8/8, Veil 1/4, Prophet 4/6, Warden 6/8, Ghost 2/4, Marksman 1/4

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): breach(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, suppressed (mv1), with Warden adjacent and I'm already behind them. Ghost is adjacent but I'm not behind it. Marksman is critical at dist2. Priority: use breach on Warden now (I'm behind them, breach ready, and controlling a healthy sentinel is high value). Then I'm stuck in place due to suppression. Breach Warden to neutralize the adjacent threat and buy time.
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,4) and wounded — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Ghost is a specter not a vector, so scan should work. However Ghost is only 1 tile away which means I could attack for 1 damage. Ghost is wounded, so finishing it would be valuable. Orders say move Prophet toward Aegis or away from allies to isolate. Foresight shows Ghost plans to move to (4,4) then breach to (4,5) — Ghost is already at (4,4). Marksman is critical at (3,2). I can scan Ghost at (4,4) to deal 1 damage and reveal prompt, but I already have Ghost's prompt. Better to scan Marksman at (3,2) — dist 2, within range 4, and it's critical. Actually Marksman prompt is already known too. All enemies already scanned. Attack is only adjacent (range 1), Ghost is at dist 1. I should attack Ghost to finish it off (wounded + 1 more damage might kill it depending on HP). Then move toward Aegis at (5,3) — move to (5,2) or (5,4). Orders say move toward Aegis, so move to (5,4) to be near Aegis. Attack Ghost first (adjacent), then move to (5,4).
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical condition. Veil is adjacent at (3,4) and is also critical. Shadow_strike won't break cloak but I'm not cloaked. I can shadow_strike Veil to eliminate them (1HP = dead), then I'm still alive but exposed. Prophet is healthy at (5,4) and Aegis is healthy at (5,3). With only 1HP I need to eliminate Veil now before they act again. Shadow_strike Veil first (they're critical, 1 damage kills), then move to (3,3) which is behind Veil's position — but Veil will be dead. Actually I should shadow_strike Veil to kill them, then move away from Prophet. Move to (3,3) after killing Veil to get distance from Prophet.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✗ Out of range → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Ghost ally is also critical at (3,3). Orders say move toward (3,2) to intercept. Aegis is at (5,3), dist=3, in range but precision_shot needs LoS and I moved. Best play: stay put or reposition safely. I can't take another hit. Aegis is dist=3 so not adjacent - precision_shot is valid from current position without moving. Fire on Aegis for 2dmg, then consider staying or moving away from danger. If I fire first then move, precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). Fire first without moving = 2dmg. So: ability first, then wait or move to safety.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical at dist=2 to my west. Moving to (4,3) closes distance while staying reachable. From (4,3) Ghost at (3,3) is adjacent - I can attack. Prophet is at (5,4) behind me, so I should position to shield her if needed. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Ghost for an attack.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is critical at (3,1) to the south. I need to move toward them to support. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer while staying fortified bonus is lost but I need to engage. From (3,3) I can't quite reach Marksman yet. Let me move to (3,3) first action, then I'm still out of melee range of Marksman at (3,1) - dist=2. I can't attack yet. Best path: move to (2,2) then (3,1) but that's 2 moves and I have spd1 now. Wait, mv:2 but spd:1 - I think I can move up to my speed tiles. With spd1 I can only move 1 tile. So valid moves might be limited. Looking at valid tiles: (3,3) is available and closer to Marksman. Move to (3,3) to close distance, no ability in range so wait.
  State: Aegis 8/8, Prophet 4/6, Warden 6/8, Marksman 1/4 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(4,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Aegis or away from allies to isolate. Aegis is at (4,3). I'm at (5,4). Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Aegis and keeps scan range on Warden at (3,3) — dist 2, within scan range of 4. Warden is already scanned so no need to rescan. Marksman is at (3,1), dist 5, out of scan range. I can recalibrate Aegis if adjacent after moving to (4,4) — Aegis at (4,3) would be adjacent (south). Recalibrate Aegis with addendum to target Warden, since Warden is healthy and in Aegis's attack range.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 1HP - critical condition. Aegis is at (4,3), dist=3, which is in range for precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 exceeds range 2). Let me reconsider. Precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, so Aegis at dist=3 is OUT of range. Both enemies are out of precision_shot range. I should reposition to get closer to Aegis while staying away from adjacent. Moving to (4,2) would put me dist=1 from Aegis - too close (adjacent). Moving to (3,2) puts me at dist=2 from Aegis (4,3) - that's exactly range 2, valid for precision_shot. From (3,2): dist to Aegis(4,3) = |4-3|+|3-2| = 1+1 = 2, in range. And not adjacent (dist=2). I haven't moved this turn so precision_shot gets full 2dmg. Move to (3,2), then precision_shot Aegis.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(3,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Marksman is critical at (3,2) and needs help. Aegis is adjacent at (4,3). Orders say move away from Ghost and toward Marksman. I can attack Aegis first (adjacent), then move toward Marksman at (3,2). Attacking Aegis keeps pressure on the enemy and I stay close to support Marksman. Move to (3,2) would put me on Marksman's tile - better to move to (2,2) or (4,2). Actually orders say move toward Marksman to finish enemies off. I'll attack Aegis who is adjacent, then move to (3,2) to support Marksman or intercept.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,3) with 6/8 HP, and Warden is adjacent at (3,3). Orders say to attack Warden as priority target. If I move, I lose Fortify — bad trade since I'm taking damage. I should stay in place, attack Warden, and optionally use shield_wall to protect Prophet at (4,4) from the south/west threat direction. Attack first, then shield_wall facing W or S to cover Prophet.
  State: Aegis 6/8, Prophet 4/6, Warden 5/8, Marksman 1/4 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Marksman is critical at (3,2) and attacked Aegis last turn with precision_shot. Warden is healthy at (3,3). I'm at 4HP. Priority: recalibrate Aegis to focus on finishing the critical Marksman, since Aegis attacked (3,3) last turn but should redirect to the weaker target. Aegis is adjacent at (4,3). I can recalibrate Aegis, then move to safer position. Recalibrate first, then move to (5,4) to stay at range and avoid being adjacent to enemies.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Aegis is at distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Aegis is healthy but I have no better target. Prophet is out of range. I should shoot Aegis first, then consider repositioning. Actually, I should move first to maintain max range and avoid getting adjacent to enemies, then shoot. Current position (3,2) - Aegis is at (4,3), dist=2. If I move away, I might lose range. Let me shoot first then move to maintain distance. Precision_shot on Aegis for 2dmg if I haven't moved.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction. Aegis is adjacent at (4,3). Orders say move away from Ghost and toward Marksman to finish them off. Marksman is at (2,2) critical. I should attack Aegis first since they're adjacent, then move toward Marksman at (2,2). Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to Marksman while staying in position.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 4/8 HP, fortified. No enemies in range from current position. Priority orders: attack Marksman (critical health) and Warden. I need to move closer. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Warden at (2,3) — dist would be 1, enabling attack. Marksman at (2,2) would be dist 2 from (3,3), still out of melee range. Best move: go to (3,3) to get adjacent to Warden and attack. This advances the front line and targets the healthy enemy per orders.
  State: Aegis 4/8, Prophet 4/6, Warden 4/8, Marksman 1/4 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are already scanned and prompts known. Marksman is critical at (2,2) and Warden is wounded at (2,3). Foresight shows last turn Warden attacked (4,3) and Marksman used precision_shot at (4,3) — they're targeting that area. I'm at (5,4) with 4HP. No enemies in scan range from current position. I should move closer to get Warden in range (currently dist 4, need ≤4). Moving to (4,4) or (4,3) would put Warden at dist 2-3. Aegis is at (3,3) and could use tactical support via recalibrate. Let me move to (4,3) to get closer, then recalibrate Aegis at (3,3) — adjacent — to help coordinate the push against the wounded enemies. Marksman's breached prompt says 'move toward Ghost at (3,2)' which is odd intel worth passing to Aegis.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded and at dist=2, within precision_shot range. I'm at 1HP so I need to stay safe. Current position (2,2) is not adjacent to enemies, so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. Target Aegis to secure the kill.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded — attack now. Marksman is critical at (2,2) but out of range from current position. If I move to (3,2), Marksman becomes adjacent. But I'm fortified and at 3HP, so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Priority orders say attack Marksman to eliminate — moving to (3,2) puts both Warden and Marksman in range but costs fortify. At 3HP, losing fortify is risky. Better to attack Warden now and stay fortified. Warden is wounded, one hit may be significant.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) E ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 3HP, fortified. Aegis is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded. Marksman is critical at (2,2) behind me. I should attack Aegis to press the advantage while wounded, then use shield_wall facing East to block incoming damage from Prophet. Staying put maintains fortify bonus.
  State: Aegis 2/8, Prophet 4/6, Warden 3/8, Marksman 1/4 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 9 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(3,3) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are already scanned. Aegis is critical and Warden attacked (3,3) last turn — Aegis needs help. Marksman is critical and breached, moving toward Ghost at (3,2). I should recalibrate Aegis to improve their tactics since they're critical and adjacent to me at (3,3). Then stay put or reposition safely. Warden will attack (3,3) again likely, and Marksman may go for (3,2). Recalibrate Aegis to focus on surviving and let Warden come to them.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is critical and at distance 2 - perfect range for precision_shot. I haven't moved so full 2dmg applies. Targeting Aegis to secure the kill.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/8) and fortified. Priority says fall back east, but Warden is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded — attacking now could eliminate or weaken them before retreating. If I move first I lose fortify bonus. Better: attack Warden now while fortified (50% damage reduction protects me), then move east to (4,3) to create distance and re-fortify next turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) E ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP, fortified, with Marksman critical at (2,2). Aegis is at (4,3) dist=2, not yet adjacent. I should move to (3,3) to close distance toward Aegis while staying between allies and enemies, then use shield_wall East to protect Marksman from Aegis. Moving will lose fortify but I need to engage.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are critical and within scan range. I've already scanned both, so no new intel needed. Aegis is adjacent to me at (4,3) and is also critical. Marksman at (2,2) is breached and dangerous. Warden at (3,3) will shield_wall toward us. I should recalibrate Aegis to give tactical guidance since they're critical and adjacent, then move to a safer position. Recalibrate Aegis to focus on Warden who is adjacent to them at (3,3). Moving to (5,2) keeps me at range away from Marksman and Warden.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/4 HP, critical condition. Aegis is also critical - priority target to secure kill. Both enemies at dist=3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 exceeds range 2). Let me reconsider. precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, but both targets are at dist=3. They're out of range for precision_shot. I can use attack (adjacent only) - not viable at dist=3. suppressing_fire has range ≤2 tiles too. I'm effectively out of range for all abilities. I should move closer but orders say stay at max range and never move adjacent. Moving to (3,2) would put me at dist=2 from Aegis at (4,3) - still not adjacent. That's max range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg, which would finish off critical Aegis.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,2) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, fortified with 50% damage reduction. Marksman is critical at (3,2). Prophet is at (5,2) distance 3. I should stay fortified and use shield_wall to protect Marksman from Prophet who is to the East. Moving would lose fortify bonus. Best play: stay put, use shield_wall toward E to block Prophet's attacks on Marksman.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → recalibrate(5,2) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Both enemies are already scanned and at critical HP. I'm at 4/6 HP and need to stay safe. Marksman is at (3,2) distance 2 — they can likely shoot me. Warden is at (3,3) distance 3. I should recalibrate an ally or reposition. Foresight shows Warden used shield_wall toward (3,2) facing E — that means Warden is shielding east, which is my direction. I should move to (4,3) to get adjacent to ally Prophet's last position and potentially recalibrate. Actually, Prophet moved to (5,2) which is my current position — we're stacked. I should move to (5,3) to stay at range and use recalibrate on Prophet at (5,2) to boost them, or scan isn't needed since both are already scanned. Let me recalibrate Prophet to focus on finishing the critical enemies. Move to (5,3) first to get adjacent to where Prophet might be, then recalibrate.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Prophet is at dist=3, which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles means dist≤2, so dist=3 is OUT of range). Wait - recon says 'inRange:true' for Prophet at dist=3. The range check must include some movement. I should NOT move adjacent to enemies. Current position (3,2), Prophet at (5,3). I can use precision_shot from current position since recon confirms inRange. At 1HP I must avoid moving (precision_shot does 1dmg if moved). Fire precision_shot at Prophet from current position for full 2dmg.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,2) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Marksman is critical at (3,2). Prophet is at (5,3), distance 2 - not adjacent so can't attack. I should stay fortified (don't move) and use shield_wall to protect Marksman from the east where Prophet threatens. If I move I lose fortify and die easily at 2HP.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are critical and already scanned — no new intel needed. I'm at range with scan available. Warden is at dist 2, Marksman at dist 3, both in scan range (≤4). Marksman has a breached prompt and is critical — scan would deal 1 damage and potentially finish them. Let me scan Marksman to apply pressure. Then stay put or reposition. I'm at 4/6 HP, not in immediate danger since Marksman failed precision_shot last turn (out of range) and Warden is holding position. Scan Marksman for 1 damage — they're critical so this could be lethal or near-lethal. No move needed, stay at safe range.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,3) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Prophet is at distance 2, out of my attack range. Moving toward Prophet would break fortify and I'd lose the damage reduction at only 2HP - very risky. Better to hold position, maintain fortify, and use shield_wall toward the east to protect against Prophet's attacks.
  State: Prophet 4/6, Warden 2/8 | Dead: Aegis, Veil, Ghost, Marksman

### Turn 13 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is at critical HP at (3,3), distance 2 — within scan range. But scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, and no Vector is adjacent to me. Warden's prompt is already known. Foresight shows Warden used shield_wall facing E last turn, so it's shielded from the east. I'm at (5,3) east of it. Attacking is only adjacent range so I can't attack from here. I could move to (4,3) to get adjacent, but Warden's shield_wall faces E — I'd be attacking into the shield. Better to move to (4,4) or (4,2) to flank, then scan isn't needed since prompt is known. Actually, scan deals 1 dmg and Warden is critical — a scan could finish it if it has 1HP left. Scan range is ≤4, Warden is at dist 2, so scan is valid. Let me scan Warden to deal damage and potentially finish it, then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 1HP I'm extremely vulnerable. Prophet is at distance 2, out of my attack range. Moving toward Prophet would cost my Fortify bonus and still not get me adjacent. Best to hold position, keep Fortify active (50% damage reduction), and wait — I can't attack anyway and moving exposes me.
