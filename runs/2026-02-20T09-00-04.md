## Squads
### Player
- **Seer** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
### Opponent
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Grid** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Veil (enemy specter) is exactly at range 4 — scan it now to reveal its prompt and deal damage before it can cloak. After scanning, move north to maintain distance from the frontline while staying in scan range of more enemies next turn.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move toward Seer at (3,2) to close distance. Seer is the closest enemy at dist=3. No enemies in range yet so cloak is safe to use. Move to (4,2) to advance toward enemy lines while staying cloaked.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(4,0) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, time to cloak. Both enemies are far away (dist 7). I'll cloak first, then advance north toward Longshot who is the priority target (enemy damage dealer). Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying cloaked.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Seer at (3,2) is closest at dist 4. I need to close to range 2. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to Seer and Rampart while staying off direct approach. Actually (3,4) puts me at dist 2 from Seer at (3,2) — that's exactly in range for precision_shot. Let me verify: from (3,4) to (3,2) is dist 2, which is within range 2. I didn't move this turn yet so precision_shot gets full 2dmg. Seer is healthy so won't kill but will wound it.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 5, none adjacent. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Enemies are at (3,4) and (2,5) - both to the north. Move to (2,2) to close distance maximally within mv2. Then use shield_wall facing N to block incoming fire from the north where both enemies are.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 3-4, out of range. Move south toward center to close gap and place a trap between my position and the enemies. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer while (2,4) is a good trap location to threaten anyone advancing north. I'll move to (2,3) then place a trap at (2,4) to deny the approach corridor between me and Rampart/Seer.
  State: Rampart 12/12, Veil 4/4, Seer 9/10, Longshot 3/3, Veil 2/4, Grid 7/7

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked at (4,2) with 2HP. Seer is adjacent at (3,2) facing N — I can move to (3,1) to get behind them, then use breach to take control. Breach is more valuable than shadow_strike here since Seer is dangerous (oracle). Move to (3,1) first, then breach Seer from behind.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Priority target is Longshot (enemy damage dealer). I can reach (2,4) which is both behind Longshot AND behind Grid. Move to (2,4) to get behind Longshot, then breach them — this forces them to obey me next turn, neutralizing the enemy striker.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (3,2). Allies are at (2,2) and (2,4). Moving toward the right edge (x=5) gets me away from both allies and the main combat. I'll move to (5,2) which is on the edge and away from the cluster. Then wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at dist=3 which is within my range=2? Wait, range 2 means ≤2 tiles. Dist=3 is out of range for precision_shot. Seer is at dist=4, also out of range. No wounded enemies visible. I need to close distance to engage. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to both enemies while maintaining distance from Rampart. From (4,3), Rampart at (2,2) would be dist=3 still out of range. Moving to (5,4) puts me closer to Seer at (5,2) - dist=2, in range for precision_shot. Let me move to (5,4) to get Seer in range.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(2,1) ✓ → pulse(2,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart (sentinel) is adjacent at (2,2) - my Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. I should place a trap on a tile Rampart might move through, or use pulse to hit them. Pulse hits all within 1 tile from my position - Rampart at dist=1 would be hit. But I can also move first to maintain pressure. Let me place a trap at (2,1) to block Rampart's retreat/advance path, then pulse from current position to damage Rampart now.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is adjacent at (2,3) — attack it. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Grid is in denial zone so shield_wall would be blocked anyway. Attack Grid first, then wait to keep fortify active.
  State: Rampart 11/12, Veil 2/4, Seer 9/10, Longshot 3/3, Veil 2/4, Grid 6/7

### Turn 3 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (5,2) facing E. Valid moves include (5,0), (5,1), (5,3), (5,5), (4,0), etc. Moving to (5,5) takes me to the corner of the map, maximally away from the combat cluster near (2,2)-(3,4). Then wait.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, adjacent to Grid (vector) who has denial active blocking my abilities. I need to move away from Grid's denial zone first, then use my remaining cloak turn to get behind Longshot (the priority damage dealer). I can move to (4,4) which is behind Longshot and adjacent — perfect for breach or shadow_strike. Moving to (4,4) first gets me into position. Grid's denial only blocks abilities, not movement. After moving to (4,4), I'll be behind Longshot and can shadow_strike to keep cloak... but cloak expires this turn anyway. Better to breach Longshot to take control of the enemy damage dealer.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 2HP, breach on cooldown. Rampart is at (2,2) facing N — I'm already behind them (south side). I can move to (2,1) which is the behind tile and adjacent, then use shadow_strike which doesn't break cloak and deals 1 damage. No cloak currently active, but shadow_strike keeps cloak if I have it. Actually I'm not cloaked. With 2HP I need to be careful. Moving to (2,1) puts me on the trap at (2,1) — danger! I should avoid that trap. Instead I can move to (3,2) to get closer to Rampart but avoid the trap, then shadow_strike won't reach. Or I could move to (4,1) or (4,2) to reposition toward Veil who is wounded. Veil is at (4,4) wounded — if I move to (3,4) I'd be behind Veil and adjacent. That's reachable in mv3: (3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)→(3,4). Then shadow_strike Veil at (4,4) for 1 damage. Veil is wounded so this could finish them. This is the better play — avoid the trap, engage wounded enemy.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward allies and away from enemy team. Allies are at (3,4) and (2,3). Enemies are adjacent at (4,4) and (5,5). Valid moves are [4,3],[4,5],[5,2],[5,3]. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to allies at (3,4) and (2,3) while moving away from Seer at (5,5). Also, being adjacent to enemy Veil at (4,4) blocks precision_shot, so moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Seer and positions me near ally Veil. From (4,3) I'm still adjacent to enemy Veil at (4,4) though. (5,3) moves away from Seer but stays far from allies. (4,3) is best — closer to allies, away from Seer.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Grid is adjacent at (2,3) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Grid's denial zone blocks abilities, but basic attack works. Attack Grid first, then shield_wall facing north where enemies are clustered.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(2,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart sentinel is adjacent at (2,2) - my Denial passive is blocking their abilities. I'm at 5/7 HP with a trap already at (2,1). Pulse would hit Rampart for 1dmg since they're within 1 tile. I can pulse then move back to maintain pressure while staying safe. Moving to (1,3) keeps me adjacent to deny Rampart abilities while creating distance options. Actually, pulse Rampart now for damage, then move to (3,3) to reposition toward the critical Veil at (4,4) for potential follow-up next round.
  State: Rampart 10/12, Veil 1/4, Seer 9/10, Longshot 3/3, Veil 2/4, Grid 5/7

### Turn 4 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (5,5) which is already at the top-right corner. Valid moves include (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) along the right edge, or (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) along the top edge. Moving along the right edge keeps me away from allies clustered around (2-4, 2-4). I'll move to (5,2) to maximize distance from combat while staying on the edge. No ability needed — just move and wait.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical priority is survival and maximum damage. I'm already behind Longshot (the enemy damage dealer) at (4,4) with Longshot facing S. I can shadow_strike Longshot for 1 damage without breaking cloak — but wait, I'm not cloaked. With 1HP I need to finish Longshot before they act next round. I already acted this round (I'm Veil ally, marked with *). Longshot is adjacent at dist=1 and I'm behind them. Breach is on cooldown. Best play: shadow_strike Longshot (1dmg, stays cloaked if I were cloaked — but I'm not cloaked so it's just a 1dmg melee). Actually at 1HP I should shadow_strike to deal damage. Longshot is healthy so 1 hit won't kill but it's my best offensive option. I could also just attack for 1dmg. Shadow_strike keeps stealth if cloaked, otherwise same as attack. I'll shadow_strike Longshot at (4,3) — it's adjacent, I'm behind them. Then move to (4,5) to create distance from Grid and Veil.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is critical HP and I'm behind them at (4,4) which is reachable in 1 move. Move to (4,4) then shadow_strike Veil at (4,5) for the kill. Shadow_strike keeps cloak so I stay hidden afterward.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2/3 HP, orders say move toward allies and away from enemy team. Veil is at (4,4) and Grid at (3,3). Seer is at (5,2) which is to my SE, Rampart at (2,2) to my SW. Moving to (4,5) puts me closer to Veil and further from both enemies. Then I can fire precision_shot at Seer from (4,5) - dist would be 3 from (4,5) to (5,2), which is out of range 2. Suppressing fire on Seer at (5,2) from current position is in range. Actually orders say to move toward allies, so just move and wait.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Nearest enemy is Grid at (3,3) dist=2, then Veil at (4,4), Longshot at (4,5). All enemies are to the NE. I should move toward Grid — moving to (3,2) gets me closer while staying off the diagonal. Grid is at (3,3), so from (3,2) Grid would be adjacent to N. I can then shield_wall N to block damage from Grid direction. But wait — caution note says Grid denial range is adjacent, so I should be careful. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Grid at (3,3)? Grid is at (3,3), (3,2) is directly south — that's adjacent. The caution says avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked. So I should avoid (3,2). Instead move to (2,3) — that puts me closer to enemies (NE direction) at dist 1 from Grid... (2,3) to (3,3) is dist=1, adjacent. Also blocked. Let me try (3,1) — dist to Grid(3,3) is 2, safe. Or I can move to (2,4) — dist to Grid is sqrt(1+1)=1.4, adjacent diagonally, probably safe from denial. Actually 'adjacent' typically means orthogonal. Move to (2,3): dist to Grid(3,3) = 1 (adjacent). Move to (3,2): dist to Grid(3,3) = 1 (adjacent). Move to (3,1): dist to Grid(3,3) = 2, safe. Move to (2,4): gets closer to Veil direction. I'll move to (2,3) — wait that's adjacent to Grid. Let me pick (3,1) to advance while avoiding adjacency to Grid. From (3,1) I can shield_wall N/E toward enemies. Enemies mostly to NE, so shield_wall E or N. Most enemies to E.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (3,1), 2 tiles south. Allies Longshot and Veil are northeast. I should place a trap between Rampart and my allies to control the approach. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Rampart, enabling Denial to block their abilities — but that's risky at 5HP. Better to hold at (3,3) or move to (4,3) to stay near Veil at (4,4) while placing a trap at (3,2) to block Rampart's advance northward. Trap at (3,2) covers the direct path between Rampart and my allies. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so trap is not blocked.
  State: Rampart 10/12, Seer 9/10, Longshot 2/3, Veil 2/4, Grid 5/7 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 5 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at dist=4, exactly in scan range. Haven't scanned Longshot yet — scanning will reveal their prompt and deal 2dmg. Veil is already scanned. Grid is a vector so scan is blocked if adjacent, but I'm at dist=2 so not adjacent — however Grid is the denial threat. Priority: scan Longshot to get intel and chip damage. Then move north toward (5,3) to stay safe and maintain range.
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → breach(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/4 HP and uncloaked. Seer is at dist=2 at (5,3) facing N, with behind tile (5,2) reachable. I can move to (5,2) to get behind Seer, then use breach to take control of this dangerous oracle. Breach is ready and this is a high-value target — an oracle controlled next turn could devastate the enemy team. Grid ally is at (4,3) nearby for support.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,3) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack possible. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Veil at (5,2) and Grid at (4,3) are both dist 3. Move toward them - (4,2) gets me closer to both. Then use shield_wall facing N or E since enemies are northeast. I should stay fortified if possible, but orders say advance. Moving to (4,2) then shield_wall facing N covers the enemy cluster to the north.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent: Rampart(sentinel) at (4,2) and Seer(oracle) at (5,3). Both within 1 tile - pulse hits both for 1dmg each. My Denial passive already blocks their abilities. After pulse, attack Rampart or Seer. Pulse first to hit both, then attack Seer (oracle) to pressure the higher-threat unit.
  State: Rampart 9/12, Seer 7/10, Veil 2/4, Grid 5/7 | Dead: Veil, Longshot

### Turn 6 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward (3,1) near Rampart. I'm at (5,3), adjacent to Grid which blocks my scan. I should move away. Best path toward (3,1): move to (4,1) gets me close to the target area and away from Grid's denial zone.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 HP is low at 2/4. Rampart is adjacent at (4,2) facing N. I can shadow_strike Rampart for 1 damage while staying cloaked — but I'm not cloaked right now. Attack would break cloak anyway. Seer is at dist 2, out of range. Breach is unavailable. Best play: shadow_strike Rampart (adjacent, keeps cloak if I had it, still deals damage uncloaked). Then move away to (5,3) to avoid retaliation from both enemies.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is adjacent at (4,3) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'm in Grid's denial zone so abilities may be blocked - but basic attack should work. I'll attack Grid first, then use shield_wall facing north where both enemies are concentrated. Wait - denial zone blocks abilities. I should attack Grid (basic attack works) and then move or wait. Actually, shield_wall is an ability and may be blocked by denial. Safe play: attack Grid, then stay fortified by not moving.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (4,2) - my Denial passive blocks some abilities. Seer is at (4,1) within range 2. Both enemies are clustered in a column. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - from my position at (4,3), Rampart at (4,2) is adjacent so pulse would hit them. Veil is at (5,3) which is adjacent to me, so pulse would also hit Veil - bad. Better to attack Rampart directly or move first. If I move to (3,2), I'm adjacent to the trap there - skip that. Move to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (4,2) and Seer at (4,1) for pulse hitting both enemies. From (5,2): Rampart at (4,2) is dist 1, Seer at (4,1) is dist ~1.4 so within 1 tile? No, dist to (4,1) from (5,2) = sqrt(1+1) ~1.41 > 1. Pulse range is 1 tile AoE. From (4,3) current position, pulse hits Rampart at (4,2) but also Veil at (5,3) - both adjacent. Don't want to hit Veil. Attack Rampart directly for 1 dmg, then place a trap at (4,1) or nearby to threaten Seer. But trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy - Rampart is adjacent so I can't place trap. I can attack Rampart (adjacent, 1dmg) then move away. Move to (3,4) first to avoid adjacency with Rampart, then I can place a trap. From (3,4) I could place trap near Seer's position. Actually: move to (3,3), then place trap at (4,1) targeting between Seer and Rampart. From (3,3) trap range is ≤2 tiles, (4,1) is dist ~2.24 - too far. Try (3,2) from (3,3) is dist 1, that's where existing trap is. Place trap at (4,2) - but that's where Rampart stands. Place at (5,2) to cut off movement. Let me just attack Rampart now while adjacent, then move to (3,3) away from enemy to enable future traps.
  State: Rampart 7/12, Seer 7/10, Veil 2/4, Grid 4/7 | Dead: Veil, Longshot

### Turn 7 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 I'm being ordered to move toward friendly fire position, but my tactical objective is to support allies and eliminate threats. Grid is 3 tiles away at (3,3) and in scan range - scanning Grid will reveal its prompt and deal damage. I should scan Grid first, then reposition to support Rampart who is wounded at (4,2). Moving to (4,3) would put me adjacent to Rampart but Grid is at (3,3) which is 1 tile from (4,3) - too close. Better to stay at current position and scan Grid, then move to (5,1) to maintain distance from Grid while staying useful.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 2HP, cloaked. Both Rampart and Seer are at distance 2. (4,1) is behind both enemies and adjacent to both. I can move to (4,1) then shadow_strike Seer (oracle, healthy, higher priority threat) — shadow_strike keeps cloak so I stay hidden. Rampart is wounded and less threatening. Taking out Seer prevents oracles from scanning me.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,1) S ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,1) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Veil first, then use shield_wall facing south to protect against further hits. Staying in place preserves Fortify.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with only 2HP - critical priority is survival. Rampart is at (4,2) dist=2, in range. Veil is critical at (4,1). I should NOT move toward enemies. Trap at (3,2) already exists. I can place a trap to deny approach routes. Moving west to (2,3) increases distance from Rampart. Then place a trap at (3,2) - wait, that's already trapped. Place at (2,2) or (3,4) to control approaches. Actually, move to (2,3) to gain distance, then trap at (3,3) my current position to punish any advance through here.
  State: Rampart 7/12, Seer 6/10, Veil 1/4, Grid 2/7 | Dead: Veil, Longshot

### Turn 8 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 HP is 1/4 — critical. Both Rampart and Seer are wounded and adjacent. I'm already behind both from (4,1). Seer (oracle) is more dangerous with ranged scanning. Shadow_strike keeps cloak, so I can hit Seer first then possibly hit Rampart too — but I only get one ability per turn. Seer is the priority target as oracles deal more threat. Shadow_strike Seer at (5,1) — 1 damage to a wounded oracle may finish them. No movement needed since I'm already in position.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move toward Rampart at (3,1) and away from allies, positioning to be attacked by my own team. I'll move to (3,1) as instructed. Veil is adjacent and critical — I could attack, but orders override tactical preference. Moving to (3,1) puts me adjacent to Rampart.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/7 HP (wounded), critical priority is survival. Allies: Veil is critical at (4,1). Enemies: Rampart at (4,2), Seer at (3,1). Traps already at (2,1), (3,2), (3,3). I need to place traps to funnel enemies. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer to action while staying safe. From there I can place a trap at (4,4) to block Rampart's path, or at (3,3) area. Actually (3,3) already has a trap. Let me move to (3,4) and place trap at (4,3) to cut off Rampart's movement north toward my allies.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) S ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) is adjacent at (4,1) and critical — attack to finish them. I'm fortified so I should not move to keep 50% damage reduction. After attacking Veil, use shield_wall facing South to block any incoming from that direction, or face toward Grid to the North. Grid is at (3,4) to the north, Veil is to the south at (4,1). Most enemies are to the south (Veil adjacent). Attack Veil first, then shield_wall facing S to protect against any remaining threats.
  State: Rampart 7/12, Seer 5/10, Grid 2/7 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Veil

### Turn 9 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → recalibrate(4,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,4), dist 3, within scan range of 4. Already scanned Grid so no need to scan again. Rampart is wounded at (4,2) and could use recalibrate. I need to be adjacent to Rampart to recalibrate — (4,2) is adjacent to me if I move to (4,1) or (3,2) or (5,2). Move to (4,2) would put me on Rampart's tile. Move to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (4,2). From (3,1) I can move to (3,2) which is 1 tile and in valid moves, then recalibrate Rampart at (4,2). Grid is at (3,4) — from (3,2) that's dist 2, still not adjacent so no blocking. Foresight shows Grid moved to (3,4) and placed trap at (4,3) — I should warn Rampart to avoid (4,3). Recalibrate Rampart with tactical advice to avoid the trap at (4,3).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,4), distance 3. I need to advance toward them. Tile (4,3) is trapped, so I must avoid it. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Grid at distance 2 without hitting the trap. From (4,4), I can use shield_wall facing North (toward Grid at y=4) to protect Seer who is wounded. This maintains fortify potential next turn if I don't move again.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/7 HP, critically wounded. Rampart is adjacent at (4,4) - I should attack or pulse to deal damage. Pulse hits all within 1 tile (1dmg AoE) - would hit Rampart at (4,4). My Denial passive already blocks some of Rampart's abilities since they're adjacent. Seer is at (3,2) dist=2, also wounded. If I pulse from current position, I hit Rampart for 1 damage. I could also attack Rampart directly for 1 damage. Better to move away first to safety then place a trap, but I'm low HP and need to be aggressive. Let me pulse (hits Rampart at dist 1) then move away from Rampart toward (2,5) to create distance. Actually, attacking Rampart directly does same damage as pulse but pulse could hit multiple. Pulse from (3,4) hits everything within 1 tile - Rampart at (4,4) is dist=1, so pulse hits them. Then move away to (2,5) to reposition.
  State: Rampart 6/12, Seer 4/10, Grid 2/7 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Veil

### Turn 10 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (2,5), dist 4, exactly in scan range. Grid is wounded and we already know its prompt. Recalibrate Rampart instead — Rampart is wounded at (4,4) and could use tactical guidance. I'll move to (4,2) to stay closer to Rampart for recalibrate range (adjacent = 1 tile), then recalibrate Rampart. Wait — (4,2) to (4,4) is 2 tiles, not adjacent. Need to be at (4,3) or (3,4) to reach (4,4). Move to (3,3) puts me at dist 1 from (4,4)? No, (3,3) to (4,4) is 2 tiles diagonal. Adjacent means exactly 1 tile orthogonally. Move to (4,3) — dist from (3,2) is 2, valid. From (4,3) to (4,4) is 1 tile north — adjacent. Recalibrate Rampart with advice to avoid Grid's pulse range and protect the flank.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with only 2HP, both enemies are out of range. I have traps at (2,1) and (3,3). Rampart is at (4,4) and Seer at (4,3). I should move toward them to close distance while placing a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer and I can place a trap at (4,4) or nearby. Wait - (3,4) is a valid move and puts me at dist=1 from Rampart. That's risky at 2HP. Better to move to (3,5) and place a trap at (3,4) to block the approach corridor between the enemies and my position.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,5), distance 2 from my current (4,4). I need to move adjacent to attack. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Grid at (3,5) — distance 1, enabling melee attack. I lose Fortify by moving, but Grid is wounded so finishing it is worth it. Moving to (4,5) then attacking Grid.
