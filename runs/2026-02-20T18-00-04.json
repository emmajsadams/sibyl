Moving to (1,2) puts me at dist 1 from Bastion — that's adjacent, meaning I risk melee exposure but precision_shot still works (1dmg since I moved). Alternative: move to (1,1), dist to Bastion = 2, within range, 1dmg since I moved. Or stay and wait — but Bastion is out of range. Best option: move to (1,1) to get Bastion in range at dist 2, fire precision_shot for 1dmg. This maintains some distance vs going to (1,2).",

I can move to (1,4) and then attack (0,4) to eliminate Seer. This eliminates a scanner threat. Let me check: (1,4) is in valid moves list. From (1,4), Seer at (0,4) is dist=1, adjacent.
