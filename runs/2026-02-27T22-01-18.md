## Squads
### Player
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Grid** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
### Opponent
- **Grid** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. All enemies are 3-5 tiles away, none in range. Cloak now to approach safely next turn. Move toward (4,2) to close distance on the enemy Marksman at (4,1) while staying cloaked.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5 and 6). Need to close distance while maintaining safety. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to enemies at (2,4) and (2,5) — dist to Grid becomes 3, Marksman becomes 4. Still out of precision_shot range (max 2 tiles) but positioning for next turn. No allies in danger yet. Ghost specter already moved this round — need to watch for flanks.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-6, max range 2). Need to close distance. Moving to (3,4) brings me closer to Marksman at (4,3) — dist would be 2, putting them in precision_shot range. But I moved, so precision_shot deals 1dmg instead of 2. Better to move to (3,4) first, then shoot for 1dmg, or move closer. Actually moving to (3,4) puts Marksman at dist=2 which is in range. Since I moved, precision_shot does 1dmg. Still worth taking the shot to start pressure.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at dist 4-5, out of range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move to (3,2) to advance toward enemy cluster. Use shield_wall facing North to protect allies from incoming fire.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at (2,4) and (3,4), moving south toward us. They'll likely advance through (3,3) or (2,3). I can move to (3,3) and place a trap on the path between them - but (3,3) is a valid move tile. Better: move to (3,3) to get closer, then place trap on (3,4) where the Marksman currently is or on (2,3) as a likely path tile. Actually, placing trap on (3,3) first then moving there would conflict. Let me move to (3,3) first, then place trap on (2,3) to catch the enemy Vector moving down. Or move to (4,2) and trap (3,3) which is a chokepoint both enemies may pass through.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,4) ✗ Position occupied → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Enemy Grid(vector) is at (3,3), distance 2 — within my range but not adjacent, so trap is available. Placing a trap at (3,4) or (3,3) area would intercept advancing enemies. Grid is at dist=2, so I can trap a tile in their path. Moving to (2,3) keeps me at safe distance while threatening their advance corridor. Better: trap (3,4) — that's a likely path for enemies moving north toward my backline, and it's within range 2. Then move to stay safe.
  State: Marksman 4/5, Grid 9/9, Bulwark 8/8, Grid 9/9, Ghost 4/4, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): breach(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, positioned at (4,2) directly behind the Marksman at (4,3) who faces N. I'm already in the perfect breach position. The Marksman is the priority target — breach them now to take control next turn, then shadow_strike to eliminate them while staying cloaked. I should breach the Marksman this turn since I'm already behind them and breach doesn't break cloak.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Grid (vector) at (3,3), which means precision_shot is BLOCKED. I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (4,4) puts me at distance 2 from Marksman (4,3) and distance 2 from Grid (3,3) — no longer adjacent to Grid, so precision_shot unlocks. All enemies are healthy, so I'll target Marksman (enemy striker) as priority. From (4,4), Marksman at (4,3) is dist=1 (adjacent) — that would still block precision_shot if Grid follows, but Grid is at (3,3) which is not adjacent to (4,4). Actually from (4,4): Grid(3,3) dist=sqrt(2)>1, not adjacent. Marksman(4,3) dist=1 — adjacent to Marksman but Marksman is a striker not a vector, so no denial. precision_shot requires LoS and range≤2, dist=1 qualifies. But wait — I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2. Better to stay and use suppressing_fire on Grid to slow it, or move to (2,4) to get away from Grid denial. From (2,4): Grid(3,3) dist=sqrt(2) not adjacent — denial cleared. Marksman(4,3) dist=sqrt(5)>2 — out of range. Grid(3,3) dist=sqrt(2)≈1.41 — in range≤2. Bulwark(3,2) dist=sqrt(5)>2 — out of range. So from (2,4) only Grid is in range. Move to (4,5) instead: Grid(3,3) dist=sqrt(1+4)>2, Marksman(4,3) dist=2 in range, Bulwark(3,2) dist=sqrt(1+9)>2. From (4,5): adjacent to no vector, Marksman at dist=2, precision_shot for 1dmg (moved). Or move to (3,5): Marksman(4,3) dist=sqrt(1+4)>2 out of range, Grid(3,3) dist=sqrt(0+4)=2 in range, not adjacent. Use precision_shot on Grid from (3,5) for 1dmg. Best: move to (4,5), precision_shot Marksman for 1dmg — chip damage on priority target.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward my own back line. Allies are at (3,3) and (3,2), so I want to move away from them — east or north. Valid moves include (5,3) which moves me east away from allies, or (4,4) which moves north. Ghost is at (4,2) adjacent south, Marksman at (4,5) north. My back line would be the eastern edge. Move to (5,3) to get distance from allies and toward the eastern back line. No attack ordered.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost(specter) is at (4,2), dist=2 and in range for trap. Enemies likely to advance through middle tiles. There's already a trap at (2,3). Place a trap at (4,3) to catch Ghost or Marksman moving toward allies. Then move to (3,4) to maintain range and stay near Bulwark at (3,2) for mutual support while keeping distance from enemy Vector at (1,4).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Ghost (specter) is adjacent at (4,2) - that's my primary threat and I can attack it immediately. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Ghost first, then use shield_wall facing East to protect allies from the eastern enemy cluster (Ghost+Marksman). Staying at (3,2) keeps fortify active.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Grid(vector) is at (3,4), dist=2 — within trap range but I'm not adjacent so trap is valid. I should place a trap on (2,4) to intercept Grid's advance toward me, then move west to (0,4) to maintain distance and keep denial pressure from a safe position. This blocks the direct path while staying out of Grid's denial range.
  State: Marksman 3/5, Grid 9/9, Bulwark 8/8, Grid 9/9, Ghost 3/4, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Priority: assassinate the wounded Marksman. Breach is on cooldown. I'm not cloaked. Move to (4,3) — behind Marksman at (5,3) — then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying hidden. (4,3) is in my valid moves and puts me adjacent+behind the enemy damage dealer.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward my back line (east side). I'm at (5,3) facing E. Allies are at (3,4) and (3,2), so I should move further east/away. Valid moves include (5,4) and (5,5) which take me away from allies and keep me on the east back line. Ghost is adjacent at (4,3) but orders say no attacking. Move to (5,4) then (5,5) to maximize distance from allies.
- **Marksman** (striker): suppressing_fire(5,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Marksman(striker) is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot. I need to move to dist=2 first, then use precision_shot on the wounded Marksman. Moving to (3,5) puts me at dist=2 from Marksman at (5,5) and maintains range. Wait — (3,5) is dist=2 from (5,5)? Distance: |5-3|+|5-5|=2. Yes. And from (3,5), Marksman at (5,5) is in range (≤2). No adjacent enemy vectors from that position — ally Grid is at (0,4), enemy Grid is at (3,4) which would be adjacent to (3,5). That triggers denial. Try (2,5): dist from (5,5)=3, out of range. Try (4,4): dist from (5,5)=|5-4|+|5-4|=2, in range. Enemy Grid at (3,4) is dist=|4-3|+|4-4|=1, adjacent — blocks precision_shot. Try (5,4): dist from (5,5)=1, adjacent to Marksman — bad. Best option: move to (3,5), but enemy Grid at (3,4) is adjacent. All moves seem problematic. Current position (4,5): Marksman is adjacent (dist=1) blocking precision_shot. I'll use suppressing_fire instead on Marksman at (5,5) — that doesn't require non-adjacent. 1dmg + slow is useful on the wounded Marksman.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Enemy Marksman is at (3,5) distance 1 - adjacent, so trap is blocked there. Ghost at (4,3) is wounded and distance 2. I should attack Ghost to finish it off or trap a likely path. Ghost is wounded so attack could be valuable. Marksman enemy is adjacent (3,5) - I can attack it. But orders say place traps on tiles enemies move through. Ghost at (4,3) moving north/west might step through (3,3) or (4,4). The existing trap is at (2,3). I'll trap (4,4) which Ghost might move through, then attack the adjacent Marksman at (3,5). Wait - I'm at (3,4), Marksman enemy is at (3,5) which is adjacent, I can attack. But trap requires empty tile within range 2 and I can't be adjacent to enemy Vector (Grid is at dist 3, safe). Let me trap (4,4) to catch Ghost movement, then attack the Marksman.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction. Ghost is wounded at (4,3) distance 2 - need to close to adjacent to attack. Marksman ally at (5,5) is critical and needs protection. Enemy Marksman at (3,5) is a threat to my ally. Moving to (4,3) would put me adjacent to Ghost and closer to protect ally Marksman. But (4,4) is a trap. Move to (3,3) to advance toward Ghost and enemy Marksman cluster, then shield_wall North to protect ally Marksman from enemy Marksman at (3,5). This keeps me in the fight without stepping on trap at (4,4).
- **Grid** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Enemy Grid is at (3,4) dist=3, blocking trap placement at (2,4) since that tile already has a trap. I should move east to get closer and place a trap on a key approach path. Moving to (1,4) keeps me safe while I can place a trap at (2,4)... but there's already a trap there. Instead, move to (1,5) and trap (2,4) — wait, trap is already at (2,4). Move to (1,4) and place trap at (2,3) to cover the southern approach corridor enemies must cross.
  State: Marksman 1/5, Grid 9/9, Bulwark 8/8, Grid 9/9, Ghost 2/4, Marksman 4/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 2HP, facing N. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) but I'm not behind it. I can move to (3,2) to get behind Bulwark, then breach it — but breach on a sentinel is the priority per orders. However, the enemy Marksman at (5,5) is the priority target. I can reach (5,4) in 3 moves which is behind Marksman and adjacent. From (4,3) to (5,4) is distance 2 (diagonal), which is within mv3. Move to (5,4) puts me behind Marksman and adjacent — then I can shadow_strike for 1dmg (they're critical, this kills them). Shadow_strike keeps cloak status but I'm not cloaked. Actually I'm not cloaked at all. Let me reconsider: move to (5,4) is reachable (it's in valid moves list at [5,4]), then shadow_strike the Marksman at (5,5) — dist 1, adjacent. This kills the critical Marksman. Shadow_strike does 1dmg and Marksman is critical (1HP likely). This is the best play.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Grid (vector) at (3,4), which means precision_shot is BLOCKED. I need to move away first. Orders say stay at max range and never move adjacent to enemies. I should move to (5,5) to get distance, then use precision_shot on Bulwark (sentinel) at (3,3) — both enemies are healthy so I'll target the sentinel since Grid is a vector with denial zone. From (5,5), Bulwark at (3,3) is distance ~2.8 (out of range 2). Let me check (4,5): dist to Bulwark at (3,3) = sqrt(1+4)=2.24, out of range. Dist to Grid at (3,4) from (4,5) = sqrt(1+1)=1.41, out of range too. From (4,4): dist to Grid = 1, still adjacent. From (4,5): dist to Grid = sqrt(1+1)~1.4, not adjacent. Precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Bulwark at (3,3) from (4,5) = sqrt(1+4)~2.24, out of range. From (2,5): dist to Grid(3,4)=sqrt(1+1)~1.4, dist to Bulwark(3,3)=sqrt(1+4)~2.24 out of range. Best I can do: move to (4,5), then precision_shot Grid at (3,4) — distance=sqrt(1+1)~1.41 which is ≤2, and I won't be adjacent. Grid is the denial-zone threat so eliminating it is priority.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Ghost is wounded at (5,4) and Marksman is at (4,5) - both enemies are clustered in the northeast. There's already a trap at (4,4) which could catch movement. I should place a trap at (5,5) or (4,3) to catch enemy movement. Grid enemy vector is at (1,4), dist=2, so I must NOT move adjacent to it. I can attack Ghost from current position (dist=2, range=2). Better to place a trap on a likely enemy path - (5,5) would catch Marksman/Ghost movement but I need to reach it. I can move to (3,5) to stay at distance from enemy Vector, then place trap at (4,5) where Marksman currently stands... but can't trap on occupied tile. Instead, move to (4,3) to threaten enemies and place trap at (5,4) or (5,5). Wait - (4,4) already has a trap. Move to (3,5) keeps distance from Grid enemy, then attack Ghost at (5,4) since it's wounded and in range=2.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✗ Cannot use trap — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Enemies Grid(3,5) and Bulwark(3,3) are both at distance 3. I have traps at (2,4) and (2,3) already covering central paths. I should place another trap to further deny enemy approach routes. Moving to (2,5) keeps me at medium range and lets me place a trap at (3,5) — but that's where Grid currently is, so invalid. Better: move to (2,5) and trap (3,4) to block the path Grid might take moving south toward our backline. Or stay and trap (2,5) from current position. Trap range is ≤2 tiles. From (1,4), I can reach (2,5) and (3,4) with a trap. (3,4) is an empty tile on the approach path between the two enemies — placing a trap there creates a threat zone. I'll move to (2,5) first to reposition slightly forward, then trap (3,4) which sits right on the enemy convergence path.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction. All enemies are 3 tiles away - Ghost(wounded) at (5,4), Marksman at (4,5), Grid(vector) at (2,5). Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (4,4) would put me closer to the enemy cluster but there's a trap there. Moving to (3,4) gets me one step closer while staying safe. Then shield_wall facing North toward the enemy cluster to protect against incoming fire. Wait - (3,4) is not in valid moves list. Valid moves include (4,3) which advances toward the enemy cluster without hitting the trap. From (4,3) I'm 2 tiles from Ghost at (5,4) and 2 tiles from Marksman at (4,5) - within attack range next turn. Shield_wall facing N/E toward enemy cluster after moving.
  State: Grid 8/9, Bulwark 8/8, Grid 9/9, Ghost 2/4, Marksman 4/5 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 5 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP, cloaked. Priority is assassinating the enemy damage dealer. The enemy Grid(vector) at (3,5) facing N is the damage dealer — I can move to (3,4) which is directly behind it and adjacent. From there I can use breach to take control. Bulwark is at (4,3) but Grid is higher priority. Move to (3,4) behind enemy Grid, then breach it.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Grid (vector) at (3,5), which means my precision_shot is blocked by DENIAL zone. I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Valid moves: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). Moving to (5,4) puts me at distance 2 from Bulwark at (4,3) and distance ~2.2 from Grid at (3,5) — but Grid would be at dist>2 diagonally. Moving to (5,5) keeps me at dist 2 from Grid (diagonal, blocked). Best: move to (5,4) — dist to Bulwark=(4,3) is 1 tile horizontal+1 vertical=dist 2, still in range. From (5,4): Grid at (3,5) is dist ~2.2 (out of range 2). Bulwark at (4,3) is dist 2 (Manhattan: |5-4|+|4-3|=2), in range. After moving to (5,4), I'm no longer adjacent to Grid's denial zone, so precision_shot works. Target Bulwark with precision_shot (2dmg, range≤2). Note: I moved this turn so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Still worth it to get out of denial and deal damage.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(3,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Grid at (2,5) which blocks my trap ability. Ghost (wounded) is adjacent at (3,4). Two enemies adjacent = pulse opportunity. Move away from Grid first to enable trap placement, or pulse now for multi-target damage. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile — at (3,5) that hits Grid(2,5) and Ghost(3,4) for 1dmg each. Ghost is already wounded so 1 more damage is good. Pulse is a basic ability (not on denial list), so it should work. After pulse, move to (4,5) to escape denial zone and set up trap.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical at (3,4) dist=2, Marksman healthy at (5,4) dist=2. I need to move adjacent to Ghost to attack. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Ghost at (3,4) — I can then attack to finish them off. Marksman is at (5,4), moving toward Ghost keeps me closer to the enemy cluster. After attacking Ghost, I lose fortify but eliminating a critical enemy is worth it.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is 2 tiles away at (4,5). I must NOT move adjacent to Grid or my trap ability gets blocked. I have traps at (2,4) and (2,3) already blocking southern approach. Grid is to my east, healthy. I can attack Grid from current position (dist=2, range=2). I should place a trap to the west/north to block flanking routes, or attack Grid directly. Bulwark is at (3,3), out of range. My orders say trap paths enemies must take. Grid at (4,5) moving west would hit (3,5) or come through (3,4). I could trap (3,5) to catch Grid if it moves west along the top row. Move to (3,5) would put me adjacent to Grid at (4,5) - that's too close. Trap (3,5) from current position: (2,5) to (3,5) is distance 1, within range 2. Yes, I can trap (3,5) to catch Grid moving west. Then attack Grid at (4,5) from (2,5) - dist=2, within attack range? Attack says range=adjacent only, so no. I can use pulse if Grid moves adjacent, but it's dist=2 now. Best: trap (3,5) to intercept Grid's westward path, then wait or reposition. Actually trap at (3,4) would also be good to block the diagonal. Let me trap (3,5) first - blocks Grid's direct westward move along row 5.
  State: Grid 8/9, Bulwark 7/8, Grid 8/9, Marksman 4/5 | Dead: Marksman, Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are healthy, no wounded targets to prioritize. No enemy medic present. Enemy Grid(vector) is at (4,5) distance 2 — in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to my ally Vector at (2,5) so no blocking concern. Stay at (5,4) to maintain range, then use precision_shot on enemy Grid at (4,5).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,5) N ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=3, out of attack range. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction — moving loses that. Orders say push forward aggressively toward enemy cluster. Grid(vector) enemy is at (2,5), Marksman at (5,4). Moving to (2,4) closes on Grid enemy and keeps me in the fight, but (2,3) is a trap. Best aggressive move is (2,4) — closes to dist=2 on Grid enemy at (2,5), then shield_wall facing N toward Grid enemy to protect and block incoming.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with traps already at (2,3) and (4,4). Grid(vector) is at (2,5) dist=2 — I must not move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. Marksman(striker) is at (5,4) dist=2. I should place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to move through. Grid is moving north from (2,5), likely toward (2,4) where Bulwark is, or could push east toward me. Marksman at (5,4) moving S/W might step through (4,4) — but there's already a trap there. I could place a trap at (3,5) to block Grid's eastward advance, or at (5,5) to catch Marksman moving north. Moving to (3,5) would put me adjacent to Grid at (2,5) — dangerous, blocks my abilities. Best: stay at (4,5) or move to (5,5). Place trap at (3,5) from current position (dist=1, within range 2) — this covers the corridor between Grid and me. Actually, (4,3) could intercept Marksman moving north. Let me place trap at (3,5) to slow Grid's eastward push, then consider moving to (5,5) to stay away from Grid while maintaining pressure.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(2,5) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,4) - I can pulse to hit it for 1 damage. Trap at (2,3) is already placed. I should move away from Bulwark to avoid being locked down, then use pulse while still in range. Move to (1,5) to stay at distance, but that keeps Bulwark at dist=2 which is fine. Actually, Bulwark is at dist=1 right now so I can pulse from current position. Use pulse first to hit Bulwark, then move to (1,4) to reposition away from Bulwark and maintain map control. The trap at (3,5) covers the eastern approach.
  State: Grid 6/9, Bulwark 5/8, Grid 8/9, Marksman 4/5 | Dead: Marksman, Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Grid at (5,5), which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first. Best move is to (4,4) or (4,5) to get dist=1.41 (diagonal) — but dist is measured in tiles so diagonal still counts as 1? Let me check valid moves: (4,4) gives dist to (5,5) of ~1.41, (4,5) gives dist=1. Actually (3,4) gives dist to (5,5) of ~2.24 which is >2, so precision_shot won't reach. (4,4) is dist sqrt(2)≈1.41 — game likely uses Chebyshev or Euclidean. If Euclidean, (4,4) is 1.41 tiles away — within range 2 but not adjacent (dist>1). That should unblock precision_shot. Move to (4,4) first, then fire precision_shot on Grid at (5,5) from dist~1.41. I moved this turn so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Still worth it to deal damage and maintain distance.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,4) with 50% damage reduction. Enemy Grid is adjacent at (1,4) and I'm in their DENIAL zone - only basic attack/movement work. I should attack Grid since it's adjacent and in range. After attacking, I can stay put to keep fortify active, but I need to consider shield_wall for my ally. Since DENIAL blocks abilities, I'll attack Grid first, then wait to maintain fortify since moving would lose the damage reduction bonus.
- **Grid** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,4) - I can pulse to deal 1dmg to all units within 1 tile. That hits Bulwark. Then I should place a trap to deny approach paths. Trap at (2,3) is already placed. I could trap (3,4) to block the corridor, but I need to check if I'm adjacent to an enemy - Bulwark is at (2,4) which is adjacent, so trap is blocked by denial. I'll pulse Bulwark first (since I'm already adjacent), then move away to place a trap. Wait - denial blocks trap when adjacent to enemy. So I must move first, then trap. Move to (0,4) to get away from Bulwark, then place trap at (2,3)... already trapped. Try (1,2) - move there, then trap somewhere useful like (3,4) to block enemy advance. Actually move to (1,3) first, then trap (3,4) to block the path between enemies.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Marksman is adjacent (dist=2, wounded) — in range for attack. Trap at (3,5) already exists. I can't move to (3,5) since it's trapped. Valid moves: (4,5), (5,3), (5,4). Moving to (4,5) puts me closer to Marksman and still adjacent to (3,5) trap. From (4,5) I could pulse if Marksman steps adjacent. Better: attack Marksman now (in range from current pos, dist=2), then move to (4,5) to stay near Bulwark and block Marksman retreat. Actually trap placement on a likely enemy path would be good — Marksman at (4,4) moving west/north. Tile (4,5) is reachable by me and not yet trapped. But attacking a wounded Marksman to potentially finish them is higher priority. Attack Marksman, then move to (4,5) to reposition.

- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Grid (vector) at (4,5), which means precision_shot is BLOCKED. I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Grid is wounded so I want to finish it off. Moving to (5,3) puts me 2 tiles from Grid at (4,5) and clears the adjacency denial zone. From (5,3) I can use precision_shot on wounded Grid at (4,5) — dist=2, within range, no longer adjacent. Bulwark is at (2,4) which is 3 tiles away from (5,3), out of range. Priority: move away from denial zone, then precision_shot the wounded Grid.
- **Grid** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with no enemies in range. Marksman is wounded at (5,3) distance 3, Grid is at (1,3) distance 5. Trap at (3,5) already placed. I should move closer to Marksman to get in trap/attack range, and place a trap on a likely path. Moving to (4,3) brings me adjacent to Marksman's position row - but (5,4) gets me closer to Marksman at dist 2. From (5,4) I can then trap (5,3) or (4,3) to block Marksman's movement. Let me move to (4,4) to be closer and place a trap at (4,3) which is between me and enemies.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,4) with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward aggressively. Enemy Grid is at (1,3) dist=2, not in melee range yet. I need to move adjacent to attack. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Grid at (1,3) — but (2,3) is a trap. Moving to (1,4) would put me adjacent to Grid. Wait — valid moves include (1,4) isn't listed. Valid tiles: [0,4],[1,4],[1,5],[2,2],[2,3],[2,5],[3,3],[3,4],[3,5]. (1,4) is valid. From (1,4), Grid at (1,3) is adjacent (dist=1), so I can attack. Shield_wall facing S to block enemy Grid. Move to (1,4) then attack Grid at (1,3). Note (2,3) is a trap so avoid it.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(1,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,4) - I can pulse for 1 damage to all units within 1 tile. Pulse hits Bulwark directly. After pulsing, I should move away to avoid Bulwark's retaliation and deny trap placement. Move to (2,2) to reposition and keep distance. Note: trap at (2,3) is already placed between me and enemy approach routes.

- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid(vector,E) is wounded and at dist=2, within precision_shot range. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to my ally Grid(vector,A) at (0,2) — dist is 5, no block concern. Fire precision_shot at (4,4) to finish off the wounded enemy vector. No need to move.
- **Grid** (vector): move(1,2) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at (1,4) distance 3, approaching from the north. I need to place traps on paths enemies will take. Moving to (1,2) gets me closer to intercept routes while staying safe. From there I can trap (1,3) to block Bulwark's southward path — that's a likely corridor they'll use to reach my backline.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → attack(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with 4/8 HP, fortified (50% DR active). Enemy Grid is at (1,2), dist=2 — not adjacent so can't attack yet. Orders say push forward aggressively. If I move to (1,3), I'll be adjacent to enemy Grid at (1,2) and can attack. But moving loses Fortify. At 4HP I need to be careful. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to enemy Grid — then attack for 1dmg. Shield_wall facing S would protect against enemy Grid to my south. Actually enemy Grid is at (1,2) which is south of me. If I move to (1,3), enemy Grid is directly south at (1,2) — shield_wall facing S would block their attack. That's the play: move to (1,3), then shield_wall facing S to block Grid's attack while being adjacent to attack next turn. Wait — orders say attack when possible. If I move to (1,3) I'm adjacent to (1,2) and can attack. Move to (1,3) then attack Grid at (1,2).
- **Grid** (vector): trap(5,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 At 3/9 HP, I'm wounded and need to be careful. Marksman is adjacent at (5,3) dist=2, so I can attack or trap. Trap at (4,3) already exists. I should move away from Marksman while placing a trap to deny their path. Moving to (3,5) gets me away and lets me place a trap on a likely enemy path. Actually, trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy - Marksman is at dist=2 so not adjacent (adjacent means dist=1). I can trap. Place trap on (5,4) or (5,5) to catch Marksman if they pursue. Then move away toward Bulwark at (1,3) for support. Move to (3,4) to close with ally, then trap (4,4) current position to deny pursuit.

- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Grid(vector) enemy is wounded and in range at dist=3. I'm at (5,3) and can use precision_shot on Grid at (3,4) — dist=3 is within range≤2? Wait, range is ≤2 tiles. Dist=3 is OUT of range for precision_shot. Need to move closer. Best move: (4,4) gets me dist=1 from (3,4) — too close, adjacent blocked. Move to (4,2): dist to (3,4) = sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, not adjacent. Actually check: (4,3) to (3,4) = dist 1+1=2 (Chebyshev? or Manhattan?). Using Manhattan: (4,3) to (3,4) = 1+1=2, within range≤2, not adjacent (adjacent=dist1). Move to (4,3): dist to Grid(3,4) = Manhattan 2, in range. Not adjacent (dist>1). Fire precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. Grid is wounded — this should finish them.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP - critically low. Marksman is adjacent at (4,3) and wounded. I need to survive. I can't place a trap at (2,3) - already has one. Grid is at (1,2) distance 4, not a threat this turn. Marksman is my immediate threat at dist=2. I should move away from Marksman while placing a trap on a tile they might pursue through. Moving to (2,4) puts distance between me and Marksman. Then place trap at (3,3) - a likely pursuit path if Marksman chases me. (2,5) would move me further but (2,4) keeps me near Bulwark at (1,3). Actually, move to (2,5) to get further from Marksman and place trap at (3,4) my current position - enemies will likely move through here chasing me.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 3HP, fortified. Enemy Grid is adjacent at (1,2) to my south - I can attack it. It's wounded so this could finish it. I'm in its DENIAL zone so only basic attack/movement work anyway. Attacking Grid first, then staying put to keep fortify bonus active. No move needed - staying fortified is worth the 50% damage reduction at low HP.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(1,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark (sentinel) is adjacent at (1,3) - I can pulse to hit it for 1 damage. Then move to (2,2) to place a trap on a path Grid might take coming down from (2,5), while maintaining distance from Bulwark. Pulse first while Bulwark is in range, then reposition.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark(sentinel) is critical and in range at dist=3. I'm at (4,3) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Bulwark is critical so this should finish it. No need to move — I'm already at range 3 which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 exceeds range 2). Re-checking: precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, but Bulwark is at dist=3. So I need to move closer. Valid moves include (3,3) which puts me at dist=2 from Bulwark at (1,3). (3,3) is a trap though. (3,4) gives dist=3 still. (3,2) gives dist=2 from (1,3)? Manhattan: |3-1|+|2-3|=2+1=3. (4,2): |4-1|+|2-3|=3+1=4. Hmm. Actually from (3,3): |3-1|+|3-3|=2 — that's in range but it's a trap. From (3,4): |3-1|+|4-3|=3 — still out of range. Only (3,3) gets me to dist=2 but it's a trap. What about suppressing_fire from current position? Range ≤2 tiles — also out of range for Bulwark at dist=3. Grid enemy at (2,5) is dist=4, also out of range. I have no valid targets in precision_shot or suppressing_fire range without moving into a trap. Best option: move to (4,2) to reposition, then wait, or accept I can't fire this turn. Actually wait — let me recheck (3,2): |3-1|+|2-3|=2+1=3, still dist=3. No valid non-trap tile gets me to dist≤2 from Bulwark. I'll move to (4,4) to maintain safe distance and wait.
- **Grid** (vector): move(1,5) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 HP is critical at 2/9. Both enemies are 3 tiles away. Traps at (2,3), (3,5), (5,4), (3,4) already block many approach routes. Enemy Grid is at (2,2) moving E, likely heading toward (3,2) or (4,2). Marksman at (4,4) moving N, may come through (4,5) or (3,4) which is already trapped. I need to stay alive and keep placing traps on likely paths. Moving to (1,5) keeps distance from enemy Grid and Marksman. From (1,5) I can place a trap on (2,4) which is on the path between enemy Grid and my position. Stay near Bulwark for mutual support.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,5) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2HP I'm critical. Fortify gives 50% damage reduction if I don't move — staying put is safer. No enemies in melee range from current position. Enemy Grid is at (2,2), dist=2, not adjacent. I can't attack without moving. Moving to (1,2) would put me adjacent to Grid at (2,2) for an attack, but I'd lose Fortify and at 2HP that's risky. Better to hold position, keep Fortify active, and use shield_wall facing south/east to protect ally Grid at (1,5) who is critical. Wait + shield_wall facing E toward enemy Grid cluster.
- **Grid** (vector): move(1,2) ✓ → pulse(1,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical at (1,3) distance 2 - within range. I'm at (2,2). I can pulse to hit Bulwark (dist 1 from me if I move to (2,3)... wait, (2,3) has a trap. Move to (1,2) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (1,3) for pulse. But I need to check denial - Bulwark is sentinel, not vector, so denial doesn't block my abilities. Bulwark is critical, pulse would hit all units within 1 tile. From (1,2), Bulwark at (1,3) is distance 1 - pulse hits. Grid is at (1,5), distance 3 from (1,2) - not hit by pulse. Marksman at (4,4) is far. Moving to (1,2) then pulsing could finish Bulwark. But wait - moving adjacent to Bulwark (sentinel) exposes me. Let me just pulse from current position (2,2): Bulwark at (1,3) is distance 2 - outside pulse range of 1. I need to move closer. Move to (1,2) to get adjacent to Bulwark, then pulse. That kills or severely damages critical Bulwark.

- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 4, outside my range-2 precision_shot. I need to close to range 2 without going adjacent. Grid(vector) at (1,5) is critical - priority target. Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist 2 from (1,5) via manhattan... (3,4) to (1,5) = 2+1=3, still out of range. Moving to (3,5) puts me at (1,5) dist=2, in range - but (3,5) is a trap! Moving to (3,4): dist to Grid(1,5) = |3-1|+|4-5|=3, still out. Moving to (3,3): dist to Bulwark(1,3) = 2, in range! And dist to Grid(1,5) = 2+2=4, out of range. Best option: move to (3,3) to get Bulwark in range at dist=2, then precision_shot Bulwark (critical). Need to avoid (3,5) trap and stay away from adjacent to enemies. (3,3) to (1,3)=dist 2, valid. Bulwark is critical so kill shot likely.
- **Grid** (vector): move(0,4) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 HP is critically low at 2/9. Both enemies are out of range. Grid(vector) at (1,2) is 3 tiles away moving west — likely to advance north. Marksman at (3,3) moving south. I should place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to cross. (2,4) is already trapped. Moving to (2,5) keeps distance from Grid and lets me place a trap at (3,5)... wait, (3,5) already has a trap. Let me move to (1,4) to stay safe and place a trap at (2,4)... also already trapped. Valid moves include (2,5) and (3,5) which are trapped. Best move: go to (0,4) to retreat and place trap at (1,3) — on Grid's likely path northward from (1,2). That's within my range of 2 tiles from (0,4): dist to (1,3) = 2, valid.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(0,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Grid(vector) is at (0,4) critical HP, moving south toward our backline. I'm at (1,2) with 4HP. I need to trap the path Grid will likely take. Moving to (1,3) puts me closer to Grid but risks adjacency. Better to move to (2,2) or stay and place a trap on (1,3) or (0,3) to block Grid's southward path. Grid is at dist=3, moving south means (0,3) is the next tile. I can't trap adjacent to enemy Vector, but Grid is 3 tiles away so trap is valid. Place trap at (0,3) to catch Grid moving south. I can reach (0,3) with move but that's only 1 tile away from Grid's current pos - risky. Instead, trap from current position (1,2) targeting (0,3) which is within range 2. Then move to (2,2) to maintain medium range.

- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(0,4) ✓
  💭 Enemy Grid(vector) is at (0,4), distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close distance. Orders say stay at max range (2) and use precision_shot. I need to move closer. (2,4) is a valid move tile and would put me at distance 2 from (0,4): |2-0|+|4-4|=2. That's exactly range 2 and not adjacent (dist=2). Check trap: (2,3) is a trap but (2,4) is not. Move to (2,4) then precision_shot the critical enemy at (0,4).
- **Grid** (vector): trap(1,4) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,4) with 1HP - critically low. Marksman is at (2,4) dist=2, critical HP. I need to either eliminate or evade. Trap placement: (1,4) is on my valid moves list and between me and Marksman - but I should place a trap on a tile they'd move through. Marksman is at (2,4) heading N, might move to (1,4) or (2,3) - but (2,3) already has a trap. I could place a trap at (1,4) then move away, or move first then trap. Move to (0,3) to get distance, then place trap at (1,3) - wait, (1,3) already has a trap. Place trap at (1,4) which is a valid move tile and likely path for Marksman approaching me. Actually, ability first: place trap at (1,4) from current position (0,4) - dist=1, within range 2. Then move to (0,2) to flee. This gives Marksman a minefield to cross.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(1,2) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is critical at (0,2), distance 2. I can attack it from current position (2,2) — that's range 2, within attack range? No, attack is adjacent only. Pulse hits all within 1 tile but Grid is 2 away. I need to move adjacent to use attack, but that triggers denial. Best option: trap a tile Grid must pass through. Grid is at (0,2) moving S, so (0,1) or (1,2) are likely paths. I can trap (1,2) which is on Grid's path toward our backline. Move to (3,2) to maintain medium range and stay out of denial range, then trap a path tile like (1,2) or (2,1).
