## Squads
### Player
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Patch** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — activate cloak immediately per orders and standing tip. Then advance toward the enemy medic Patch at (4,5) or the clustered enemies. Moving toward (1,3) pushes me up the board while staying cloaked. Cloak first, then move north to close distance.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move toward Watcher (closer target at dist 6). Moving to (1,4) gets me closer while staying stealthy.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,5) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: Marksman is at (2,5), exactly 4 tiles away — within scan range. Priority is to scan Marksman to reveal their strategy. I'm currently at (2,1) facing N. Scanning from current position works. After scanning, I'll recalibrate Bolt at (4,0) — but Bolt is not adjacent to me (dist=3), so recalibrate won't reach. Ally Wraith is at (1,3), also not adjacent. No recalibrate target in range. Best play: scan Marksman now, then move north to stay behind allies and position for future recalibrate.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP. No healing needed. Enemies are far away. I should reposition to stay behind my allies and move toward the action to be useful next round. Moving to (3,4) brings me closer to Wraith at (1,4) and keeps me safe.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is at (2,3), distance 2, within my range 3. I'm at (2,5) not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. No enemies are wounded yet, and Watcher is the enemy support unit — priority target per orders. I'll fire precision_shot on Watcher first, then hold position to maintain max range.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Patch at dist 5, Marksman at dist 7). My range is 3 (or 4 with High Ground if no adjacent enemy). I need to close distance. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer — Patch would then be at dist 3 (|4-3|+|2-4|=3), which is exactly in range. No enemies adjacent so High Ground passive gives +1 range (rng 4), but Patch at dist 3 is still in base range. Let me move to (4,2): Patch@(3,4) dist = |4-3|+|2-4| = 1+2 = 3, in range. Then use precision_shot on Patch (medic priority per orders).
  State: Wraith 5/5, Bolt 4/4, Watcher 6/8, Wraith 5/5, Marksman 4/4, Patch 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining and both enemies are 3 tiles away. I need to close the distance. Patch at (3,4) facing S has a behind tile at (3,5). I can't reach behind Patch this turn directly. Moving toward (2,4) gets me closer to both enemies while staying cloaked. From (2,4) next turn I can potentially reach Patch or get adjacent for shadow_strike.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) at (2,3) facing N is a high-value target — oracles provide vision/support. I can reach (2,2) which is directly behind Watcher (behind tile confirmed, adjacent). Move to (2,2) then breach Watcher to take control of them next turn. This uses my cloak positioning perfectly.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the map edge. Allies are at (2,4) and (4,2). I'm at (2,3). Moving to (0,3) takes me away from both allies and toward the west edge. Then I can scan Patch at (3,4) — but after moving to (0,3), Patch is at dist=3 which is within range 4. Actually let me prioritize the move order: first move to (0,3) to separate from allies. Then scan Patch since their prompt is unknown and they're a medic worth scanning.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,4) ✗ Position occupied → wait ✓
  💭 Both allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Enemies are out of range. I should reposition to stay safe and support Marksman who is nearby. Moving to (2,5) is not valid, but I can move toward Marksman at (2,5) — closest valid tile is (3,5) or (2,4). Moving to (2,4) puts me closer to Marksman for potential overclock next turn. No ability targets available this turn.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(0,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is in range at dist=4, Bolt is out of range at dist=5. Orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded — Watcher is an oracle not medic, but it's the only target in range. Both enemies are healthy. I'll use precision_shot on Watcher since it's the only viable target. I'm at (2,5), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is valid. I should stay at max range, so no need to move.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say target enemy medic when no one is wounded. Patch (medic) is at (3,4), dist=3, in range. No enemies are wounded. I'm at (4,2), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Patch is at range 3 which is within precision_shot range (≤3). I haven't moved so no damage penalty. Stay put and use precision_shot on Patch.
  State: Wraith 5/5, Bolt 4/4, Watcher 6/8, Wraith 5/5, Marksman 4/4, Patch 3/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires next turn so I need to act now. Patch is wounded and I can get behind them at (3,5) for a breach — that's high value since it removes their healing. Move to (3,5) to get behind Patch, then breach them so they obey me next turn. This is better than shadow_striking Marksman who is healthy and facing away.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Bolt is at (4,2) facing N — I can reach (4,1) which is behind Bolt and adjacent. Shadow_strike from there deals 2dmg and keeps cloak. Move to (4,1) then shadow_strike Bolt.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. I'm at (0,3) on the west edge already. Valid moves include (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5) which keep me on the west edge. Allies are at (3,5) and (4,2), so moving south toward (0,1) takes me away from the northern ally. I can move 2 tiles max. Go to (0,1) to hug the southwest corner away from allies. No ability needed this turn per orders.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(1,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (3,5) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Orders say never move adjacent to enemies, but I'm already adjacent. I need to move away first. Valid moves that increase distance from Wraith at (3,5): (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (0,5). Moving to (1,5) gives dist=2 from Wraith, which is within range 3 for precision_shot. Bolt is wounded at (4,2) dist=5, out of range. Wraith is healthy. After moving to (1,5), Wraith at (3,5) is dist=2, in range, no adjacent enemy — precision_shot is valid for 2dmg.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (4,1) — this blocks precision_shot. Orders say target wounded enemy or medic. Patch (medic) is wounded at (3,4), dist=3, in range. I need to move away from the adjacent Wraith first to enable precision_shot, and stay at max range. Moving to (4,4) puts me dist=2 from Patch and away from Wraith. Actually, move to (5,3) — dist from Patch=(3,4) is 3, clears adjacency with Wraith, and keeps max range. From (5,3), Patch at (3,4) is dist=sqrt(4+1)~2.2, so Manhattan=3, in range. Precision_shot requires LoS and range≤3. After moving, no adjacent enemy so precision_shot unblocked. Target Patch (wounded medic).
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward nearest wall. I'm at (3,4). Allies are at (4,1) and (1,5). Nearest wall options: top wall (y=5) is close. Moving to (5,4) then (5,5) would reach the right/top corner and move away from allies at (1,5) and (4,1). Valid moves include (5,4). From there I could reach the wall. Let me move to (5,4) first, then wait — actually I have mv2 so I can reach (5,4) in one move (dist=2). That gets me to the right wall area and away from ally Marksman at (1,5).
  State: Wraith 4/5, Bolt 2/4, Watcher 6/8, Wraith 5/5, Marksman 4/4, Patch 2/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,5) ✓
  💭 Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining, so can't use it this round. Marksman is at dist 2, facing W, and I can reach (2,5) which is behind them and adjacent — perfect for shadow_strike while staying cloaked. Move to (2,5) then shadow_strike Marksman for 2 damage without breaking cloak.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → breach(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded and I can reach position (5,2) which is directly behind Bolt (facing N). From (4,1) I can move to (5,2) in one move (dist=1 from there, total move cost=2). Then I can breach Bolt from behind — this wastes their next turn and sets up a kill. Breach is ready and this is a high-value play on a wounded enemy.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(0,5) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first. Valid moves that increase distance from Wraith at (2,5): moving to (0,4) gives dist=sqrt(4+1)~2.2, (0,5) gives dist=2, (1,3) gives dist=sqrt(0+4)=2, (1,4) gives dist=sqrt(1+1)~1.4. Best option is (0,4) or (0,5) to get dist≥2 and break adjacency. After moving to (0,5), Wraith is at dist=2 which is within range 3 and not adjacent — precision_shot becomes available. Bolt is wounded but out of range. Wraith is healthy but the only reachable target. I'll move to (0,5) to escape adjacency, then use precision_shot on Wraith.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(1,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. I'm at (0,1) facing S. Allies are at (2,5) and (5,3). Moving to (1,0) then (0,0) gets me to the corner edge, away from both allies. Valid moves include (1,0) and (0,0) is reachable in two steps — move to (1,0) first, then (0,0). Wait as second action.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Watcher. Watcher is at (1,0), I'm at (5,3). I need to move toward (1,0). Valid moves toward Watcher: (4,2) gets me closer (distance decreases). I'm adjacent to enemies Wraith at (5,2) and Patch at (5,4), so precision_shot is blocked. I can use suppressing_fire or attack. Moving to (4,2) moves toward Watcher and away from ally Wraith at (2,5). After moving to (4,2), Wraith at (5,2) is 1 tile away - I could attack for 1dmg. Let me move first to (4,2), then attack Wraith.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) facing east. Orders are to move away from allies and toward the nearest wall. The eastern wall is at x=5 (already there). The northern wall is at y=5. I can move to (5,5) which is the corner — both east and north walls. That's the farthest from allies and hugs the wall. Then wait.
  State: Wraith 3/5, Bolt 2/4, Watcher 6/8, Wraith 4/5, Marksman 2/4, Patch 2/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent at (4,2) facing S, wounded. I can move to (4,3) to get behind Bolt, then shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked. That should finish or heavily pressure Bolt. Breach is unavailable anyway.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → breach(0,5) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and I can reach position (1,5) which is directly behind them (they face W). Move there then use breach to take control of the wounded Marksman — they'll obey me next turn and I can use them to damage their own team. Breach cooldown is ready and I have 1 breach left.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 6, 6, 9 vs my range 4). I need to move closer to scan priority targets. Moving to (3,0) gets me closest to the enemy cluster without exposing myself. From there I still can't scan this turn, but I'll be better positioned. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. Best move is toward (3,0) to close distance, then wait since no abilities are in range.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,5) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (1,5), wounded. I'm at 2HP so need to be careful. Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I can use basic attack (adjacent, 1dmg) on the Wraith. Or I could move away first to enable precision_shot — moving to (0,4) or (0,3) would put me at dist 2 from Wraith, enabling precision_shot for 2dmg. Move to (0,3) first, then precision_shot the Wraith at dist 2 for 2dmg — much better than 1dmg attack.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the nearest wall. I'm at (5,5) which is already at the east and north walls. Valid moves: [3,5],[4,4],[4,5],[5,3],[5,4]. Moving to (5,3) keeps me on the east wall and moves me further from allies at (4,3) and (0,3). Then wait.

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and reachable — I can move to (0,4) which is directly behind them (facing S, so behind tile is (0,4)). From there I can shadow_strike for 2 damage while staying cloaked if I am cloaked, or just attack. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Moving to (0,4) gets me adjacent and behind Marksman. Shadow_strike does 2dmg and keeps cloak — but I need to check if I'm currently cloaked. No cloak status mentioned, so I'll use regular shadow_strike which still does 2dmg. Marksman is wounded so 2 damage may finish them. Move to (0,4) then shadow_strike.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,0) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Watcher at dist 4, Wraith at dist 5). Breach is exhausted. I need to close distance. Watcher at (3,0) is closer and I can move toward it. Moving to (3,2) gets me within 2 tiles of Watcher next turn. No valid shadow_strike targets this turn. I'll move aggressively toward Watcher to pressure it.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,1) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (3,1) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... but Wraith is a specter, not a Vector. However, scan range requires ≤4 tiles and Wraith is at dist=1, so scan would work technically. But the real issue: I'm at 4/8 HP and an adjacent enemy Wraith is healthy. I need to retreat. Foresight shows enemy Wraith moving to (4,3) then shadow_striking (4,2). My ally Wraith moved to (1,5). I should move away from the enemy Wraith to avoid being attacked, then scan if possible. Moving to (2,1) puts me at dist=2 from enemy Wraith at (3,1) — safer. Then I can scan the enemy Wraith to reveal their prompt. Valid moves include (2,1). Let me move to (2,1) first to get distance, then scan enemy Wraith at (3,1) — dist will be ~1.4, within range 4.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with only 2/6 HP — critically wounded. My ally Wraith is at (3,1) with 4/5 HP, dist=4, needs heal but is not adjacent. Enemies are far away (dist 5-6). I need to move toward the Wraith to heal them next turn, but I must also protect myself. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Wraith at (3,1) — dist would be 2. Then I can wait or position further. Valid moves include (4,2) which reduces distance to Wraith to 2, and (3,3) which reduces it to 2 as well. Let me move to (3,3) to get within heal range next turn (dist to (3,1) from (3,3) = 2, still not adjacent). Actually from (4,2), dist to (3,1) = sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, so adjacent diagonally — but game uses Manhattan distance likely. Manhattan from (4,2) to (3,1) = 1+1=2, not adjacent. From (3,3) to (3,1) = 0+2=2, also not adjacent. I can't reach adjacent this turn. Move to (4,2) to get closer, then wait.

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are 6 tiles away, out of reach this turn. I have 2HP so I need to be careful. I can move up to 3 tiles. Best move is toward the enemy cluster at (3,1) and (4,2). Moving to (3,4) gets me closest while staying away from the enemy Wraith who acts before me. From (3,4) I'm 3 tiles from Patch at (4,2) — still not adjacent but closing in. No ability targets in range, so I'll just advance.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,1) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (2,1) and wounded. Breach is unavailable. I can move to (2,0) which is behind Watcher, then shadow_strike for 2 damage while staying cloaked. This likely finishes the wounded Watcher. Wraith is out of range at dist=3.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with 2HP — critically low. Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (2,0), which blocks my scan ability. I must move away from it immediately. Patch the medic is at (4,2) and already scanned. My ally Wraith is at (3,4). I should move to increase distance from enemy Wraith and get Patch in scan range if possible, or recalibrate my ally. Moving to (3,2) gets me away from adjacent enemy Wraith and keeps me at range. Actually, I need to move away from (2,0) — moving to (2,3) puts 3 tiles between me and enemy Wraith, and keeps scan range open. From (2,3), Patch at (4,2) is dist ~2.8, within scan range 4. But Patch is already scanned. My ally Wraith at (3,4) is adjacent from (2,3) — I could recalibrate them. Let me move to (2,3) then recalibrate ally Wraith at (3,4) with tactical addendum about targeting Patch.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with only 2HP — critical condition. My allied Wraith is at (2,0) with 4/5 HP, wounded but dist=4, out of reach this turn. No enemies are in range. I have 3 heals left but can't reach my ally. I should move toward the wounded Wraith to heal next turn. Moving to (2,2) would bring me adjacent to (2,0) next turn (dist=2, within my move speed). That's 2 steps west. But I need to survive — enemies are at dist=3 so I'm not in immediate danger. Move to (2,2) to position for heal next turn.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP. Patch is at (2,2) wounded and is the priority target. Recon shows I can reach (3,2) which is behind Patch and adjacent — perfect for shadow_strike. Move to (3,2) first, then shadow_strike Patch for 2dmg while staying cloaked. Breach is unavailable so shadow_strike is my best option.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher is critical and I can get behind it by moving to (2,2). Move there first, then shadow_strike Watcher at (2,3) — I'm behind it facing N, so (2,2) is the behind tile. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 2dmg which should finish off a critical enemy.
