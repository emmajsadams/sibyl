I need to advance toward nearest enemies while protecting wounded allies. Moving to (2,2) advances me toward Prophet and Viper cluster without triggering Viper's denial zone (Viper is at (4,2), adjacent would be (3,2),(5,2),(4,1),(4,3)). From (2,2) I'm closer to the action. Then shield_wall facing S (toward Deadeye at y=0) — actually enemies are mostly to the S/SE. Bolt is at (1,2) wounded to my SW. Shield_wall facing S would protect against Deadeye. But Viper is to the E at (4,2), Prophet to SE at (3,1). Most enemy threat comes from S direction. I'll move to (2,2) to advance, then shield_wall facing S to protect Bolt who is wounded at (1,2).",
