I need to move away from Warden first, then shoot Hawk. Moving to (3,3) gets me away from Warden and maintains range 2 to Hawk at (4,4) - dist would be sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, still in range. Actually from (3,3) to (4,4) is dist=sqrt(2)≈1.4, within range 2. Warden won't be adjacent. Then fire precision_shot on Hawk for 2dmg kill.",
