I should move toward enemies to eventually get in range, while laying a trap on a likely approach path. The trap at (4,3) is already placed. Enemies are approaching from the west/southwest. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer and I can place a trap at (5,3) or nearby to cover the eastern flank. Actually, moving to (5,1) puts me closer to Deadeye who is critical at (3,0). I can place a trap at (4,1) to intercept Deadeye's path, or trap at (4,2) as a chokepoint. Let me move to (4,2) to reposition closer to action, then place a trap at (3,2) to block the corridor - but wait, trap range is ≤2 tiles. From (4,2) I can reach (3,2), (2,2) is 2 tiles, (4,4) is 2 tiles. Place trap at (3,2) to intercept Bastion moving east, or (4,1) to intercept Deadeye. I'll move to (4,2) then trap (3,2) - a likely approach path for Bastion.",

Bulwark is adjacent at (2,3) — wounded sentinel who just used shield_wall facing S. I can recalibrate Bulwark to coordinate better. Move to (3,4) to stay safe and get adjacent to Bulwark for recalibrate, but (3,4) is valid and Bulwark is at (2,3) — that's diagonal, not adjacent. Let me check: Bulwark @(2,3), I'm at (3,4) — distance is sqrt(2), diagonally adjacent. Recalibrate requires adjacent only. From (4,4) Bulwark at (2,3) is distance 3, out of range. Move to (3,4) first: then Bulwark at (2,3) is 1 diagonal away — if adjacent means orthogonal only, that won't work. Move to (3,3): Bulwark at (2,3) is 1 tile west — orthogonally adjacent. From current (4,4), moving to (3,3) is valid (in move list). Then recalibrate Bulwark at (2,3). Good plan.

Then for second action, since DENIAL blocks abilities while adjacent to Viper, I should attack Bulwark or wait — but I can only use one attack per turn.
