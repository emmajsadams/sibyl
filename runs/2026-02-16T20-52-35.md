## Squads
### Player
- **Seer** (oracle): "Use foresight early to give your team intel. Target enemy specters with mind_spike to break cloak. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Patch** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 - cloaking immediately as instructed. Moving toward Longshot (closest at dist 4) to set up for shadow_strike next turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✗ Out of range → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is in range at (2,4). Moving first would reduce precision_shot damage to 1. Better to shoot now for 2dmg, then reposition.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is at max scan range (4 tiles). Scanning to reveal enemy prompts provides crucial intel for my team. I'll scan Warden first, then move forward to prepare for scanning Lattice next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies at full HP. Longshot is our damage dealer. Moving to (3,2) gets me adjacent to Seer and closer to Longshot for future support.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall S ✓
  💭 Seer and Patch are equidistant at 3 tiles. Moving to (2,2) advances toward Seer (directly south) and brings me within 1 tile. Most enemies are to the south, so shield_wall facing S protects allies behind me.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Move forward to establish chokepoint control. Place trap at (2,3) to control central corridor between enemies and allies.
  State: Seer 8/8, Longshot 4/4, Patch 6/6, Warden 10/10, Lattice 6/6, Wraith 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 Cloaked and have 3 high-value targets within breach range. Patch (medic) is priority - healing prolonged battles. Move to (3,1) behind Patch, then breach to sabotage their healing and flip them to our side.
- **Patch** (medic): attack(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both allies at full HP - no healing needed. Adjacent to enemies Warden and Wraith. Attack Wraith to support damage output.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(3,1) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Wraith is cloaked at (3,1) adjacent to me. Lattice (vector) is at (2,3) blocking my scan range. Priority: scan Wraith to reveal its prompt for the team, then move to safety away from the cloaked threat.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden (sentinel) at (2,2) is closest threat at dist 2. Lattice (vector) at (2,3) is adjacent to Warden. Moving back to (0,3) maintains distance while keeping both in range. Precision_shot Warden first as it's the immediate threat.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent (Seer at (1,2) and Patch at (3,2)). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Seer is closer to center of enemy formation. Attack Seer, then shield_wall facing East to protect from Patch and Longshot.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 Three enemies at range 2. Warden adjacent at (2,2). Move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Patch at (3,2), activating Denial to block their patch ability. Then place trap at (1,3) to control the chokepoint between Seer/Longshot and our position.
  State: Seer 7/8, Longshot 4/4, Patch 6/6, Warden 9/10, Lattice 6/6, Wraith 4/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(3,2) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining) → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Patch (medic) at adjacent range. Perfect setup for breach — I can hijack their healing abilities next turn. After breach, I'll still have movement to reposition.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,3) ✗ Can only move 2 tiles → patch(1,2) ✗ Cannot use patch — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Seer is wounded (7/8 HP) and needs healing. Must move adjacent to Seer at (1,2) to use patch. Moving to (2,2) would put me on Warden's position (invalid). Moving to (1,3) or (1,1) would be adjacent. However, Lattice (vector) is at (3,3) - if I move too close to allies while adjacent to vector, patch may be blocked. Best option: move to (1,3) to be adjacent to Seer, then patch.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Wraith will move to (2,1) and breach Patch at (3,2). I should scan Wraith now to reveal its prompt before it cloaks. Warden is adjacent blocking my movement north, but Longshot already damaged it. I'll scan Wraith first, then move away from Warden to (0,2) to stay safe.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden and Lattice both in range at distance 3. Orders prioritize medics then damage dealers. Enemy has Patch(medic) but not in LoS from current position. Warden(sentinel) is a tank, Lattice(vector) can deny abilities. Wraith(specter) is high-threat damage dealer but out of range. Move to (1,3) to maintain distance from Wraith while keeping Warden/Lattice in range, then precision_shot Lattice to eliminate vector threat.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall W ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is adjacent at (3,2). Attack first to deal damage, then shield_wall facing west where Seer and Longshot are positioned to protect allies.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Patch(medic) is adjacent at (3,2). Use denial passive to block their abilities. Move to (2,3) to position between enemies and deny Longshot at (1,3). Then pulse to damage both Patch and Longshot if in range, or trap (3,1) to control the chokepoint south.
  State: Seer 7/8, Longshot 2/4, Patch 5/6, Warden 9/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 4/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is closest at dist=2, facing N. Position (3,1) is directly behind them and reachable in 1 move. I'll move there and breach to turn their medic against them.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) is adjacent at distance 1, blocking my precision_shot. I need to create distance. Moving to (0,3) puts me at range 2 from Lattice, then I can precision_shot Warden (sentinel) who is a high-priority tank.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(3,1) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is cloaked and at max range (4 tiles). Scan it to reveal its prompt and give team intel. Then move to (1,3) to stay safe behind Longshot while maintaining scan range on threats.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot at 2/4 HP is critically wounded (50% HP). Seer at 7/8 HP is less urgent. Must reach Longshot. Move west toward (0,3), then north to get adjacent for heal next turn. Moving to (1,2) gets closer.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall W ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is adjacent at (1,2). Attack first, then shield_wall facing W where most enemies are clustered (Patch, Longshot, Seer all to the west).
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → pulse(1,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is adjacent at (1,3) - my Denial passive blocks their scan. Patch at (1,2) and Longshot at (0,3) are clustered. Move to (1,4) to stay in range of all three enemies, then pulse to hit Seer and Longshot (both within 1 tile from (1,4)). This damages multiple targets and maintains denial zone.
  State: Seer 6/8, Longshot 2/4, Patch 4/6, Warden 8/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 4/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is closest at dist 3, but (2,2) behind him is occupied by Warden. Longshot is wounded and vulnerable. Move to (2,3) to get closer to enemy cluster, then shadow_strike Seer at (1,3) to deal damage while staying cloaked.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✗ Cannot use scan — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Lattice (vector) is adjacent at (1,4), blocking my scan ability. I need to move away first. Wraith (specter) is likely cloaked and dangerous. I'll move to (0,4) to get away from Lattice, then scan Wraith at (2,3) to reveal their prompt to my team.
- **Patch** (medic): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is critically wounded at 2/4 HP (50%). Move adjacent to heal. Path: (1,2)→(0,2)→(0,3) uses both move actions, so heal next turn. Alternative: move (1,2)→(0,2) this turn, then move+heal next turn. But Longshot needs healing urgently. Best: move to (0,2) now to get closer, position for heal next turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Cannot use precision_shot — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 At 2HP, critically wounded. Lattice (vector) adjacent blocks precision_shot. Must move away to enable precision_shot. Move to (1,3) to maintain range 3 to all enemies and clear adjacency, then precision_shot Wraith (highest threat, specter class).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall W ✓
  💭 Nearest enemies are Longshot and Patch at dist=2. Moving west to (1,2) closes gap toward both. Wraith is north at (2,3), Lattice at (1,4). Most enemies (Longshot, Patch, Seer) are west/northwest. Shield_wall facing W protects allies from western threats.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(1,4) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 Two wounded enemies adjacent. Pulse hits both Seer and Longshot for 1dmg each. Then attack Longshot to finish (currently wounded, likely 3-4HP remaining after previous damage). Denial already blocking their abilities.
  State: Seer 3/8, Patch 4/6, Warden 8/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 4/5 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,3) ✓ → breach(0,4) ✗ Breach limit reached (max 2 per game)
  💭 Seer is wounded and within striking distance. Move to (0,3) (behind Seer, adjacent) then breach to turn them against their own team.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) is adjacent at (1,4), blocking my scan ability. I need to move away to regain scan capability. Wraith (specter) is also adjacent at (0,3). Moving to (0,5) creates distance from both threats while staying behind my front line. From there I can scan next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(0,4) ✓ → patch(0,5) ✗ Cannot use patch — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Seer is wounded (3/8 HP) and needs healing. Currently surrounded by enemies (Wraith adjacent at 0,3 and Warden at 1,2). Must move away from enemies first to avoid Vector blocking patch ability, then move toward Seer. Moving to (0,4) puts me adjacent to Seer and away from Warden.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(1,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent at (0,4). Denial passive blocks their abilities. Pulse hits both enemies (Patch at dist 1, Seer at dist 2 from me after accounting for AoE). Then move to (2,4) to maintain denial on Patch while repositioning.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(0,3) ✗ Position occupied → shield_wall(0,3) N ✓
  💭 Patch is closest at dist 3. Move to (0,3) to advance toward enemies (Wraith already there, but I can stack). Then shield_wall facing N to protect from both Seer and Patch.
  State: Seer 3/8, Patch 3/6, Warden 8/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 4/5 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(0,4) ✗ Breach limit reached (max 2 per game) → shadow_strike(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Patch at (0,4) who is wounded. I can breach them this turn to take control of their medic next turn, which will be devastating for the enemy team. Then use shadow_strike to finish them off while maintaining cloak.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith (specter) at (0,3) is cloaked and threatening our critical Patch. Must scan to reveal prompt and enable counterplay. Wraith is dist=2, within scan range (≤4). Not adjacent to enemy Vector, so scan will work.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,5) ✓ → patch(0,5) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded (3/8 HP) and needs healing. Wraith is adjacent blocking my healing range. Must move away from Wraith to avoid Vector denial, then heal Seer who is at (0,5).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) N ✓
  💭 Patch is closest at dist 3 and critical HP. Move to (1,3) to advance (dist reduces to 2). Shield_wall facing N to protect from both northern enemies.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(1,5) ✗ Position occupied → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is critical HP at (1,5), in range for trap. Placing trap on (1,5) forces them to either step on it (eliminating them) or move away. Then move to (3,4) to control center and potentially pulse next turn.
  State: Seer 5/8, Patch 1/6, Warden 8/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 4/5 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → breach(0,5) ✗ Breach limit reached (max 2 per game)
  💭 Seer at (0,5) is healthy and facing N. I'm at (0,3) facing W. Recon shows (0,4) is behind Seer and adjacent. I can move to (0,4) and breach Seer to hijack their next turn, forcing them to attack their own medic or waste their turn.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded (5/8 HP) and needs healing. Currently at (1,5), Seer is at (0,5) which is adjacent. I can patch Seer this turn. Wraith is adjacent to Seer at (0,4) which could threaten them, so healing now is critical.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(0,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith (specter) is adjacent at (0,4) and healthy. Enemy specters are high priority — use scan to reveal Wraith's prompt and break any stealth advantage. Then move away from Wraith to maintain safe distance.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,4) ✓ → shield_wall N ✓
  💭 Seer is adjacent at (1,4). Attack first, then shield_wall facing N to protect from both enemies.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → pulse(2,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is at range 2, healthy. I can trap (1,3) to block their advance toward Warden, then pulse to damage both Seer and Patch if they cluster. But Patch is critical and distant. Better: move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Seer, activating Denial to block their abilities, then pulse to damage Seer and any adjacent enemies.
  State: Seer 5/8, Patch 1/6, Warden 8/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 4/5 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 9 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(1,4) ✓ → move(0,5) ✓
  💭 Seer (oracle) is adjacent at (1,4). I'm behind Patch at (1,5) but can't reach behind-tiles this turn. Seer is healthy and adjacent - I should shadow_strike to deal 2dmg while maintaining cloak, then reposition.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → patch(1,4) ✗ Cannot use patch — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Seer is wounded (3/8 HP) and needs healing. I have 1 patch remaining. Wraith (specter) is adjacent at (0,5), blocking me from safely healing. I need to move away from Wraith to avoid being blocked by the enemy Vector, then heal Seer. Moving to (2,5) puts me adjacent to Seer at (1,4) while creating distance from enemies.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → scan(0,5) ✓
  💭 Lattice is adjacent blocking my scan. I'm at 3/8 HP and surrounded by enemies. Patch is critical. I should move away from Lattice to break adjacency, then scan Wraith to reveal their prompt since they're a high-threat specter.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is critical and adjacent - finish with pulse to hit both enemies. Seer at range 2, Patch at range 1. Pulse hits all within 1 tile.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(0,3) ✓ → attack(0,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is 2 tiles away at (0,4). Move to (0,3) to get adjacent, then attack.
  State: Seer 2/8, Warden 8/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 4/5 | Dead: Longshot, Patch

### Turn 10 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → breach(0,4) ✗ Breach limit reached (max 2 per game)
  💭 Seer is critical (low HP) and adjacent. I can move behind them to (1,4) and use breach to take control, eliminating this threat by turning them against their own team.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → scan(1,4) ✓
  💭 Critical HP (2/8). Wraith adjacent at (1,4) and Warden at (0,3) both threaten lethal. Must escape immediately. Move to (1,5) away from both threats. Then scan Wraith at (1,4) to reveal their prompt for team intel (scan range 4, dist=1 after move).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) N ✓
  💭 Seer is 3 tiles away at (1,5). Move closer to (1,3) to advance toward enemy. Then use shield_wall facing north since Seer is the only enemy and they're to the north.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,4) ✗ Position occupied → pulse(1,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is critical at (1,5), 2 tiles away. Move to (1,4) to get adjacent, then pulse to finish them off. This also positions me next to Wraith for coordination.
  State: Seer 2/8, Warden 8/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 3/5 | Dead: Longshot, Patch

### Turn 11 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(1,5) ✗ Breach limit reached (max 2 per game) → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is critical (1HP) and I'm already behind them. Breach to take control and use them against their own team.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(1,4) ✓
  💭 At 2/8 HP, critically wounded. Wraith is adjacent at (1,4) and wounded - high threat. Lattice adjacent to Wraith blocks scan. Move to (3,5) to escape Wraith's range, then scan Wraith to reveal its prompt since it's wounded and likely cloaked.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is 4 tiles away at (3,5). Orders are to advance toward nearest enemy. Moving to (3,3) closes distance to 2 tiles and positions me to engage next turn. No enemies adjacent, so no immediate attack. Shield wall not useful with only 1 enemy.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → pulse(3,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is critical (low HP) at range 2. Move adjacent to finish with pulse AoE, which hits all units within 1 tile of me. This secures the kill.
  State: Seer 1/8, Warden 7/10, Lattice 5/6, Wraith 3/5 | Dead: Longshot, Patch
