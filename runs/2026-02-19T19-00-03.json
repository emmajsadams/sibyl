Dist shown as 4 from (2,5) — Manhattan: |2-0|+|5-3|=4. From (1,4): |1-0|+|4-3|=2. That's well within range 3. I can move to (1,4) then use precision_shot on Lattice. Lattice is wounded — priority kill. At (1,4) I won't be adjacent to Lattice, so precision_shot is not blocked. I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty).

          "thinking": "Lattice is at (0,3), distance 3. I can move up to 2 tiles. Moving to (0,2) closes distance to 1 — adjacent and in attack range. But caution note says avoid moving adjacent to Lattice. Moving to (0,2) puts me at distance 1 from Lattice at (0,3), which IS adjacent. The caution is about my OWN abilities being blocked, not about attacking. Actually the caution says Lattice's denial range is adjacent — so if I move adjacent to Lattice, my abilities get blocked. Better to move to (0,2) which is distance 1 from (0,3)... wait, (0,2) to (0,3) is distance 1 = adjacent. That triggers Lattice's denial. So I should stay back or move to a non-adjacent tile. Valid moves include (0,1) which is distance 2 from Lattice — not adjacent. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move to (0,2) would be adjacent to Lattice but my attack would be blocked. Move to (0,1) keeps distance 2. Actually attack range is adjacent only, so from (0,1) I still can't attack Lattice at (0,3) — that's distance 2. I'll move to (0,2) to be adjacent and attack, accepting that vector denial blocks abilities... but attack IS an ability. So moving adjacent to Lattice blocks my attack. I'm stuck: to attack I need adjacency, but adjacency blocks attack. Best play: move to (0,2) to pressure and threaten, use shield_wall facing N to protect allies, preserving fortify is lost since I'm moving.",
