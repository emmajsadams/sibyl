## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
### Opponent
- **Insight** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders. All enemies are 6-7 tiles away, out of reach this turn. After cloaking, advance toward the enemy cluster (Aegis at 2,5, Insight at 3,5). Moving to (1,3) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying on approach vector toward Aegis/Insight.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(3,0) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist=5, need ≤4). I need to move closer. Moving to (3,2) gets me dist=1 from Longshot at (3,0) — too close. Moving to (3,3) puts me dist=3 from Longshot and dist=3 from Rampart, both in scan range. I'll move to (3,3) then scan Longshot at (3,0).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Insight (oracle) is in range at dist=3, within my range=2? Wait, dist=3 but my range is 2. The recon says Insight is inRange from current position. Precision_shot has range ≤2 tiles. Distance to Insight is 3... but recon says inRange:true. I'll trust the pre-computed recon. I haven't moved so precision_shot gets full 2dmg. Insight is a high-value oracle target per orders. No enemies adjacent so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire at Insight first, then consider repositioning.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded at (4,1), dist=3. I can move south to (4,2) to get closer, then place a trap between Longshot and my position. Moving to (4,2) brings me to dist=1 from Longshot — but that might put me adjacent and block my own trap. Better to move to (4,3) and place trap at (4,2) to intercept Longshot if they advance north. This controls the corridor between enemy positions and allies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Orders say push forward aggressively. No enemies in range yet. Move toward enemy cluster - advance to (2,3) to close distance. Then shield_wall facing South (toward enemies at y=1) to protect allies Viper and Insight nearby.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is 2 tiles north at (2,3). I should advance to (2,2) to be adjacent and intercept any attack on Longshot who is wounded. From (2,2) I can use shield_wall facing North toward Aegis to protect allies behind me.
  State: Rampart 12/12, Shade 4/4, Longshot 1/3, Viper 7/7, Insight 10/10, Aegis 12/12

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,2), dist=2, in scan range and not yet scanned. Longshot already scanned. Priority: scan Rampart to reveal prompt and deal 1dmg. I'm at (3,3), no movement needed — Rampart is within 4 tiles. After scanning, I have no second ability, so I'll move to (3,4) to maintain distance from Rampart who is moving aggressively north.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Aegis is adjacent to my south at (2,3) facing S, so I can move to (2,4) to get behind them for a breach. That's a high-value play — breach Aegis to take control of a sentinel, then use shadow_strike on a softer target next turn. Move to (2,4) first, then breach Aegis who is at (2,3) and I'll be directly behind them (they face S, I'd be at their north... wait, facing S means they look south, so behind them is north = (2,4) is above them = north of (2,3). Yes, (2,4) is behind Aegis. Execute: move to (2,4), breach Aegis.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → move(3,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/3 HP — critically low. Viper is 2 tiles away at (4,3), which is in range for precision_shot but I must NOT move adjacent. Orders say medics first, but Insight is out of range. Viper is the only in-range target. I should fire precision_shot on Viper (2 dmg would kill if healthy at low HP), then move away to create distance. If I shoot first (no move penalty), I deal 2dmg. Then I'll move to (5,1) or (3,0) to maintain distance from Viper at (4,3). Moving to (5,1) keeps distance=2 from Viper. Actually moving to (3,0) puts dist=sqrt(1+9)~3.2 from Viper. Best: shoot first, then move to (3,0) to increase distance from all enemies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say move south toward Longshot. Valid moves south include (2,1). But Rampart is adjacent at (2,2) — I can attack before moving to deal damage. Then move to (2,1) to pressure Longshot's direction. This costs fortify but follows orders.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with a trap already at (4,2). Shade is at (2,4) moving toward our backline, Rampart at (2,2) pushing up. I should move west to (3,3) to get closer to the action and place a trap at (3,2) to cover the approach path between Rampart/Shade and our allies. This creates a chokepoint along the y=2-3 corridor.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,1) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack Aegis since it's in range, then use shield_wall to protect Shade at (2,4) from Insight/Viper to the north. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
  State: Rampart 10/12, Shade 4/4, Longshot 1/3, Viper 5/7, Insight 10/10, Aegis 11/12

### Turn 3 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks my scan ability. I need to move away from Shade first to enable scanning. Moving to (4,4) increases distance from Shade to 2 and keeps me in scan range of all enemies. Then I can scan Shade to reveal its prompt and deal damage. Rampart and Longshot are already scanned.
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/4 HP with breach on cooldown. Insight (oracle) is a high-value target at (4,4) facing E — I'm already behind them. Position (3,4) is behind Insight, reachable in 1 tile, and adjacent. I can move to (3,4) and use shadow_strike to hit Insight for 1 damage while staying cloaked. This is the optimal play — eliminate/weaken the oracle without exposing myself. Viper is at (3,3) so I must avoid (3,3) and adjacency. Moving to (3,4) keeps me 1 tile from Viper at (3,3) — that's adjacent! Wait, (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3). The caution says Viper blocks abilities when adjacent. I need to avoid moving adjacent to Viper. (3,4) is adjacent to Viper at (3,3), so shadow_strike would be blocked there. Let me reconsider. I could move to (4,5) to reposition — not adjacent to Viper. Or move to (4,3) which is behind Viper but also adjacent. Actually (4,5) is reachable and keeps distance from Viper. But then I can't strike this turn. Alternatively, stay at (2,4) and wait — but that wastes a turn. Let me check (3,5): dist from (2,4) is 2, reachable, not adjacent to Viper at (3,3). From (3,5) I could shadow_strike Insight at (4,4)? Dist from (3,5) to (4,4) is 2 — not adjacent. Hmm. Best option: move to (4,5) — safe from Viper, sets up next turn. Or use shadow_strike from current pos — no enemies in range. I'll move to (4,5) to reposition safely away from Viper, setting up a strike on Insight next turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,1) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/3 HP — critical condition. Aegis sentinel is 2 tiles away and a threat. I cannot move adjacent to Viper or precision_shot gets blocked. Priority: shoot Aegis with precision_shot (dist=2, in range), then move away to safety. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Moving after shooting to create distance from Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move south toward Longshot. I'm at (2,1), Longshot is at (5,0). Moving to (3,0) gets me closer and is within my move range of 2. Rampart is adjacent at (2,2) but orders say to disengage south. I can't reach Longshot this turn (dist=4), so I'll move south and wait.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → pulse(2,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,2), dist 2, within range. I have traps at (4,2) and (3,2) already placed. I should stay close to Rampart to deny their abilities with my passive. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Rampart, activating Denial. Then I can pulse to hit Rampart for 1dmg. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - only Rampart is nearby at dist 2 from current, but from (2,3) Rampart at (2,2) would be dist 1 - that works. Let me move to (2,3) to be adjacent to Rampart, then pulse to damage them.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is adjacent at (2,3) and has DENIAL active blocking my abilities. I can still use basic attack. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) which is valuable — I should not move. Attack Viper with basic attack, then wait to keep fortify.
  State: Rampart 9/12, Shade 2/4, Longshot 1/3, Viper 4/7, Insight 10/10, Aegis 10/12

### Turn 4 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → recalibrate(2,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (4,5) — wounded and dangerous (shadow_strike). I cannot scan while adjacent to a Vector, but Shade is a specter not a Vector, so scan is unblocked. However, Shade's prompt is already known. Rampart is at distance 4 — already scanned too. Longshot is out of range at distance 5. Priority: move away from Shade to avoid shadow_strike while staying in scan range of useful targets. Moving to (3,5) puts me at dist 2 from Shade (safer) and dist 3 from Rampart (still in scan range). But all enemies are already scanned. I should recalibrate Viper who is wounded — Viper is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to me at (4,4). I need to move adjacent to Viper to recalibrate. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Viper at (2,3) — distance 1. But (3,3) is in valid moves. Then recalibrate Viper to help the wounded ally. This also moves me away from Shade.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 Insight at (3,3) facing S means (3,4) is directly behind them and adjacent — perfect for breach. I can move to (3,4) and breach Insight to take control of the oracle. With only 2HP left I need to be aggressive and impactful. Breach cooldown is ready and I have 1 more use. Moving to (3,4) puts me behind Insight, adjacent, enabling breach.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,0) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. Aegis (sentinel, healthy) is in range at dist=2. Orders say precision_shot high-value targets. Aegis is a sentinel — not a medic or damage dealer, but it's the only target in range. At 1HP I need to fire then reposition. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Fire on Aegis first, then move to (4,1) to create distance from Aegis at (3,0) while staying away from Viper/Insight.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,0) ✓ → attack(4,1) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (4,1), distance 2 from my position (3,0). I need to move adjacent to attack. Moving to (3,1) puts me at distance 1 from Longshot at (4,1) — adjacent diagonally, but sentinel attack is adjacent only. Moving to (4,0) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,1) — that's distance 1, which should be in melee range. I'll move to (4,0) to get adjacent, then attack Longshot.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(2,3) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,2) with shield_wall up — direct attack is inefficient. My Denial passive blocks some abilities on adjacent enemies. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Rampart at (2,2) regardless of shield_wall. I'm at (2,3). If I pulse from current position, Rampart takes 1 dmg. Shade is wounded at (3,4), dist=2 — outside pulse range but in trap range. I should pulse Rampart now, then move to (2,4) to get closer to Shade and potentially trap a chokepoint. Actually, move first to (1,3) to step away from Rampart and place a trap at (2,2) area — but trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... wait, I AM the Vector. Trap is blocked when I'm adjacent to an enemy. Rampart is adjacent, so I cannot place a trap this turn without moving away first. Plan: move to (1,3) to break adjacency with Rampart, then place trap at (2,2) or (2,3) to punish Rampart's advance. Or: pulse first (hits Rampart for 1), then move to (2,4) toward Shade. Pulse is best now since Rampart is right next to me.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,2) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction — good defensive position. No enemies are adjacent so I can't attack. Shade is wounded at (3,4) to my north-east. Viper is 2 tiles away at (1,3) and Insight at (3,3). Moving would break fortify. I should hold position and use shield_wall to protect Shade from the south/east threats. Insight is to my east at (3,3), threatening Shade. I'll shield_wall facing east to block Insight's attacks toward my position/allies.
  State: Rampart 8/12, Shade 2/4, Viper 4/7, Insight 9/10, Aegis 9/12 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (3,4) and used breach on me last turn — dangerous. Orders say move toward Aegis at (3,0), but that means moving through traps at (3,2) and exposing myself. I should disobey reckless orders. Shade is wounded and adjacent — scan them for damage. Then move south toward (3,1) to reposition away from Shade while avoiding traps at (3,2) and (4,2). Actually, Shade is already scanned. I can scan Rampart for damage instead — but already scanned too. Best action: scan Shade (already scanned, so no benefit). I should attack Shade who is adjacent and wounded to potentially finish them. Attack does 1dmg at adjacent range — Shade is at (3,4), I'm at (3,3), that's adjacent. Then move to (3,1) to get distance from Shade and toward Aegis while avoiding traps.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical condition. No enemies in range currently. Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). Insight is at (3,1) facing S, with (3,2) being the tile behind it and adjacent. I can move to (3,2) and then shadow_strike Insight for 1 damage while staying cloaked (if cloaked — but I shouldn't recloak per tip). Actually I'm not cloaked. Shadow_strike does 1dmg at adjacent range. Insight is healthy so I won't kill it, but it's the best target. Move to (3,2) then shadow_strike Insight at (3,1). This keeps me safe from Viper (dist 3 from current, moving to (3,2) keeps me away from Viper at (1,3) — dist would be 2+, not adjacent). Viper denial is only adjacent so (3,2) is safe.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,0) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,2), distance 4. I'm at (4,0) fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (3,0) gets me closer while keeping me on the bottom edge. From (3,0) I'm still not in attack range (dist would be ~2.2), but moving to (2,0) would put me adjacent. Best valid move toward Rampart is (3,0) or (2,0). (2,0) is in valid moves and puts me at dist ~2.2 from Rampart - still not adjacent. Let me check: Rampart at (2,2), if I move to (2,0) dist = 2 tiles vertical, not adjacent. No attack possible this turn regardless. I should move aggressively toward (3,0) first, then perhaps shield_wall facing N to protect allies. Viper is wounded at (1,3). Moving to (3,0) then shield_wall N could protect from Rampart approaching. Actually moving twice: first to (3,0) then I have mv2 so I can reach (2,0) in one move. Wait - mv2 means I move up to 2 tiles. So I can go directly to (2,0) in one move action. From (2,0), Rampart at (2,2) is dist=2, still not adjacent. No attack. I'll move to (3,0) to advance, then shield_wall facing N to block Rampart's advance toward allies.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,3) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies are in adjacent range to attack. Viper is 2 tiles away at (1,3) — moving adjacent would block abilities, so I should avoid (1,2) or (2,3) unless I want to engage. Insight is at (3,1) to my SE. I should hold position to maintain Fortify bonus and use shield_wall to protect nearby allies. Aegis is a friendly sentinel to my E. I'll shield_wall facing N or W to intercept incoming threats from Viper's direction.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(2,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,2) with shield_wall up — direct attack is ineffective. My Denial passive blocks some abilities but shield_wall isn't in that list. Pulse would hit Rampart from current position (1,3) since dist=2... wait, pulse range is 1 tile AoE, so Rampart at dist=2 is out of pulse range. Best play: place a trap between Rampart and my allies to control the chokepoint. Rampart is at (2,2), allies are at (3,0) and (3,1). Tile (2,1) or (2,3) would be good chokepoints. (2,3) is within my move range and I could trap there. Actually, I should trap a tile Rampart might move through. If I move to (0,3) to maintain distance, then trap (1,2) or (2,2) area. Or: stay put and trap (2,3) which is in range (≤2 tiles from me at (1,3), dist=1). That blocks Rampart's northward path toward allies. Actually trap requires empty tile — (2,3) should be empty. Place trap at (2,3) to threaten Rampart if they advance, then move away to (0,3) to stay safe.
  State: Rampart 8/12, Viper 4/7, Insight 8/10, Aegis 9/12 | Dead: Shade, Longshot

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Aegis at (3,0) and away from allies. Foresight shows Shade (enemy specter) moving to (3,2) then shadow_striking (3,1) — my current position. I must not stay at (3,1). Moving to (4,0) gets me toward Aegis and away from that threat. Rampart is at (2,2), already scanned. I can scan nothing useful this turn. I'll move to (4,0) then wait.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,2), dist=3. I'm at (3,0) fortified. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (2,1) gets me adjacent to Rampart at (2,2) — dist=1, attack range. I'll move to (2,1) then attack Rampart. Losing fortify but orders are aggressive push.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,3) with 4/7 HP. Rampart is at (2,2) with shield_wall up, dist=3, out of range. I have traps at (4,2) and (2,3). My orders are to control chokepoints. I should move toward Rampart to get closer while placing a trap to block movement paths. Moving to (1,3) puts me closer. I can then place a trap at (2,3) — wait, there's already a trap there. Let me move to (1,3) and place a trap at (1,2) or (2,2) area to control the chokepoint between Rampart and my allies. Actually (2,3) already has a trap. I'll move to (1,3) first, then place a trap at (1,2) to create a barrier between Rampart at (2,2) and my allies.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction — moving would lose that. Aegis is adjacent at (2,1) to my south, which is an enemy sentinel. I should attack Aegis and stay put to keep fortify active. Viper is 2 tiles away so I need to avoid moving toward them.
  State: Rampart 7/12, Viper 4/7, Insight 8/10, Aegis 8/12 | Dead: Shade, Longshot

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,0) ✓ → scan(2,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Aegis at (3,0). Rampart is at (2,2), distance 4 — within scan range. I already have Rampart's prompt. Aegis is attacking Rampart this turn. Moving to (3,0) keeps me at distance 3 from Rampart, still in scan range next turn. From (3,0) I can scan Rampart again for damage, since it's wounded and Aegis is attacking it too — let's finish it. Distance from (3,0) to (2,2) = 1+2 = 3, in range. Execute orders: move to (3,0), then scan Rampart to add pressure.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, and Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,1). I should attack Aegis while maintaining my fortified position. Staying put preserves Fortify passive. Attack Aegis first, then shield_wall south to protect against Aegis counterattack.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,2) with shield_wall up — direct attack is wasteful. I'm at (1,3) facing E. I have traps at (4,2), (2,3), (1,2) already placed. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile for 1dmg — Rampart is at dist 2, so pulse won't reach. I should reposition to deny Rampart abilities and place another trap to funnel movement. Moving to (2,3) would put me adjacent to Rampart (enabling Denial) but (2,3) already has a trap — can't move there. Move to (1,4) keeps me mobile and away from traps. Then place a trap at (2,4) to cut off northern escape routes and pressure Rampart's movement. My Denial passive already blocks scan/breach/etc on adjacent enemies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing North to block incoming damage while staying fortified isn't possible if I move, but I can attack without moving to keep fortify active. Attack Rampart, then shield_wall N to protect against further hits.
  State: Rampart 5/12, Viper 4/7, Insight 8/10, Aegis 7/12 | Dead: Shade, Longshot

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,1) ✓ → recalibrate(2,1) ✓
  💭 Rampart is already scanned and wounded at (2,2). No unknown enemies to scan. Allies are wounded — Aegis at (2,1) is adjacent to me after a move. I should recalibrate a wounded ally to buff them. Aegis is at (2,1), which is distance 2 from me — not adjacent. Viper is at (1,4), too far. Let me check: I'm at (3,0). Adjacent means distance 1. No allies are adjacent. I could move toward Aegis to get adjacent, then recalibrate. Move to (2,1) would be distance 1... but Aegis is at (2,1). I can move to (3,1) which is distance 1 from (2,1) — wait, (3,1) to (2,1) is dist 1, so adjacent. From (3,1) I can recalibrate Aegis at (2,1). That puts me closer to Rampart at (2,2) though — dist from (3,1) to (2,2) is 2, still safe. No enemy vectors nearby to block scan. Since Rampart is the only enemy and already scanned, recalibrating Aegis is the best play.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when adjacent and shield_wall facing N toward Rampart. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall N to protect against further attacks while maintaining fortify position.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Aegis is adjacent at (2,1) - I should attack it since it's wounded. I'll stay put to maintain Fortify and attack Aegis, then wait to keep the fortified bonus.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with 4/7 HP. Rampart is at (2,2) with shield_wall, not adjacent to me (dist=3), so trap is not blocked. There's already a trap at (2,4) and (2,3). I should reposition to threaten Rampart while staying safe. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer. From there I can't reach Rampart directly but I can place a trap between enemy positions. Let me move to (2,5) to stay safe and place a trap at (2,3) — wait, (2,3) already has a trap. Let me place at (3,3) to cut off Rampart's movement paths. Moving to (3,4) first, then trap at (3,3) to block Rampart's advance.
  State: Rampart 4/12, Viper 4/7, Insight 8/10, Aegis 6/12 | Dead: Shade, Longshot

### Turn 9 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(2,1) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Rampart is already scanned. No cloaked enemies visible. Aegis is wounded and adjacent at (2,1) — recalibrate to buff them. Then stay put or reposition. I'm not adjacent to any Vector, so recalibrate is safe. Move to maintain distance while recalibrating Aegis.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → pulse(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 4HP. Rampart is at (2,2) with shield_wall, dist=3, not adjacent. No enemies in range from current position. I have many traps already placed. I should reposition to threaten Rampart while staying safe. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer to Rampart at dist=1, enabling pulse or denial pressure. But Rampart has shield_wall active. Let me move to (3,3) which is a trap tile — wait, traps are at (3,3) so I shouldn't move there. Move to (4,3) keeps me mobile and I can place a trap at (3,2) to cut off Rampart's path north or threaten approach. Actually (3,3) has a trap already. Let me move to (2,3) — also has a trap. Safe moves: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (3,2). Moving to (3,2) puts me dist=1 from Rampart at (2,2) — I could pulse for 1dmg hitting Rampart. But shield_wall may reduce damage. Still worth it to apply pressure. Move to (3,2) then pulse targeting self-position to hit Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at 3HP with 50% damage reduction. Viper is adjacent at (3,2) and in DENIAL zone blocking abilities except basic attack. Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,1). I should attack Viper (wounded, closer threat) while staying fortified — moving would lose fortify bonus. I cannot use shield_wall due to DENIAL zone. Attack Viper, then wait to keep fortify.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,2) N ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,2) to my north, critical HP. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Best play: shield_wall facing N to block Rampart's attack, then attack Rampart to finish them off while they're critical.
  State: Rampart 2/12, Viper 3/7, Insight 8/10, Aegis 6/12 | Dead: Shade, Longshot
