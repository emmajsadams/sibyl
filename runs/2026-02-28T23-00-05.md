## Squads
### Player
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then advance south toward the enemy cluster. Enemies are all at y=0-1, I'm at y=4. Move toward (3,3) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Then advance toward enemies. Marksman at (5,4) is the priority target. Move toward (1,3) to start flanking north.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 6, out of my range 2. I need to advance to get them in range. Moving toward center-left to close distance while maintaining positioning. No valid shots this turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) E ✓
  💭 Enemies are at distance 4-5, out of range. I should advance to hold the front line between allies and enemies. Moving to (2,3) puts me forward while staying between Ghost at (1,3) and the Marksman at (4,3). From there I can use shield_wall toward the east to protect allies from the Marksman.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, both enemies are out of range. I should advance toward the center and place a trap along the likely approach path. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer to the action while (3,1) is a good trap location to block enemy advance through the center corridor. I'll move up first then place a trap on (3,2) to deny that chokepoint.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at distance 3. I should move forward and place a trap in the chokepoint between my position and the enemies. Moving to (3,4) puts me closer while staying out of denial range of enemy Weaver at (3,2). From (3,4) I can place a trap at (3,3) — right in the path enemies would advance through, and where my ally Phantom currently stands... actually avoid that. Place trap at (2,3) where Bulwark is? No, trap goes on empty tiles. Bulwark is at (2,3). Place trap at (3,3) — wait, Phantom is there. Try (2,4) as a chokepoint trap between enemy Bulwark's likely advance path.
  State: Bulwark 8/8, Ghost 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Phantom 4/4, Marksman 5/5, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak has only 1 turn remaining — it will drop after this turn. Neither enemy is reachable this turn (both at dist 3, mv3 but can't end on them). I need to close the gap toward the Marksman (priority target at 4,3 facing S). Moving to (3,3) gets me 1 tile closer and within range next turn. The enemy Weaver at (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3) — that would block cloak/breach. Better to move to (2,4) or (2,5) to flank from the north side and stay away from the enemy Weaver. Actually (2,4) is reachable and keeps distance from enemy Weaver while positioning me to approach Marksman from behind next turn. Let me check: Marksman is at (4,3) facing S, behind tile is (4,4). From (2,4) I'd need to reach (4,4) next turn — dist 2, reachable with mv3. That's the play.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and adjacent to enemy Weaver whose denial zone blocks breach/cloak. I need to escape the denial zone first. Moving to (3,1) puts me behind Weaver — then I can shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while maintaining cloak. Weaver is high-value target (denial zone disrupts my team). Move to (3,1) then shadow_strike Weaver at (3,2).
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 No medics present. Priority targets: Ghost (specter, high mobility threat) and Weaver (vector enemy, can block my abilities if adjacent). Currently at (4,3), Weaver enemy is at (3,2) dist=2 — safe to fire. Ghost is at (2,4) dist=3, outside precision_shot range of ≤2. Bulwark sentinel at (2,3) dist=2 is in range. My ally Weaver is at (3,4) — I must not move adjacent to it. Best play: precision_shot Bulwark (dist=2, in range, no movement so full 2dmg). Then consider moving to maintain distance. If I fire first without moving, I get full 2dmg on Bulwark.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in range. Enemy Weaver is at (3,4) distance 2 to my north-east, Phantom at (3,1) south, Marksman at (5,3) east. Allied Ghost is at (2,4) north of me, allied Weaver at (3,2) south. I should hold position to keep fortify bonus active. I can use shield_wall toward the east to protect against Marksman, or toward the north-east where enemy Weaver is. Since Marksman at (5,3) is the most direct eastern threat and I'm on the front line, I'll stay put and use shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Marksman fire.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,1) - I'm already denying their abilities. I can attack Phantom for 1dmg, or place a trap. Enemy Weaver is at (3,4) dist=2, so I need to be careful not to move adjacent to them. Phantom is right below me - attacking is safe and useful. I could also move to (4,2) to avoid being flanked and place a trap at (3,1) to punish Phantom. Better: attack Phantom now (they're adjacent, easy damage), then move to (4,2) to reposition away from enemy Weaver while staying in control position.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (2,4) — denial is active against it. I can pulse to hit Ghost and potentially Bulwark. Ghost is dist=1, Bulwark is dist=2 so pulse (1-tile AoE) hits Ghost but not Bulwark. I should pulse Ghost first, then move to (4,4) to reposition and place a trap on the chokepoint between enemies and allies next turn. Actually, I can move first to (4,3) to stay near Weaver's denial range edge, then pulse. Or better: pulse now hitting Ghost at dist=1, then move to (4,4) away from Ghost/Bulwark cluster. Pulse hits all within 1 tile of me — Ghost at (2,4) is dist=1, Bulwark at (2,3) is dist=2 so not hit. Pulse Ghost for 1 damage, then move to (4,4) to reposition.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Ghost 2/4, Weaver 8/9, Phantom 3/4, Marksman 5/5, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 2HP, cloaked. Priority is assassinating the enemy damage dealer — Marksman at (5,3). I can reach (4,3) which is directly behind Marksman (facing E, so behind is west tile). From (4,3) I can use breach on Marksman to control them. But enemy Weaver at (4,4) is only 2 tiles away and would block cloak/breach if I move adjacent to it. (4,3) is adjacent to Weaver at (4,4) — that's a problem. Let me reconsider. Phantom at (3,1) facing S — behind tile is (3,2), reachable in 1 tile from many positions. I could move to (3,3) then breach Phantom from behind... but (3,2) is the behind tile and I need to be there. Actually I can move to (3,2) directly — dist from (2,4) to (3,2) is |3-2|+|2-4|=1+2=3, exactly my movement. Then breach Phantom from (3,2) — adjacent and behind. Phantom is healthy but breach would make them obey me next turn. However, Marksman is the priority damage dealer. (4,3) is behind Marksman but adjacent to enemy Weaver at (4,4) which blocks breach. So Phantom breach is the safer play. Move to (3,2), then breach Phantom who is at (3,1) facing S — I'm directly behind them.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move north toward Marksman and attack them next turn. Marksman is at (5,3). I need to move north/northeast. Ghost is at (3,2) directly north — I can pass through enemies via Ghost Step but can't end on them. Moving to (3,3) puts me behind Ghost and closer to Marksman. Wait — orders say attack Marksman next turn, so I should position to reach Marksman. Moving to (3,3) then next turn I can move toward (5,3). But Ghost is wounded and adjacent — I could shadow_strike Ghost now (1dmg, keeps cloak if cloaked, but I'm not cloaked). Actually orders say move north toward Marksman and attack them next turn, so I should just reposition. Moving to (3,3) is behind Ghost but moves me north. From (3,3) I can reach Marksman area next turn. I'll move to (3,3) and wait — no second action needed for repositioning.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded and high priority. At dist=3, precision_shot has range ≤2, so I need to close to 2 tiles. Ghost is at (3,2). If I move to (5,1), dist to Ghost=(3,2) would be |5-3|+|1-2|=3, still out of range. If I move to (5,2), dist to Ghost=(3,2) would be |5-3|+|2-2|=2, in range. Enemy Weaver(vector) is at (4,2) — if I move to (5,2), I'm adjacent to (4,2)? No: dist from (5,2) to (4,2) = 1, that's adjacent. Precision_shot would be blocked by adjacent Vector. Check (5,1): dist to Weaver(4,2)=|5-4|+|1-2|=2, not adjacent. Dist from (5,1) to Ghost(3,2)=|5-3|+|1-2|=3, out of range. Hmm. What about staying at (5,3)? Enemy Weaver at (4,2) is dist=2, not adjacent, so precision_shot is NOT blocked. Ghost at dist=3 is out of range for precision_shot (≤2). Weaver at dist=2 — can I use precision_shot on Weaver? Yes, dist=2 is in range. Orders say medics first then damage dealers — no medics visible, so target damage dealers. Weaver(vector) is healthy at dist=2, currently in range. I haven't moved so no penalty. Use precision_shot on Weaver at (4,2) from current position (5,3). Then consider second action — maybe move to maintain distance or wait.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) E ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. If I attack Phantom without moving, I keep fortify. Ghost is wounded at (3,2) — I can shield_wall East to protect Ghost from Phantom. But Phantom is already adjacent to me, so attacking deals damage now. Best play: attack Phantom (adjacent, in range), then shield_wall East to protect Ghost from Phantom. Stay put to maintain fortify.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Enemy Weaver is at (4,2), dist 2 — in trap range but I'm not adjacent so trap is available. I should place a trap between enemy positions and my allies. Ghost is at (3,2) wounded, Bulwark at (2,3). Placing a trap at (3,3) would intercept movement toward my ally Phantom who is there — bad idea. Better to place trap at (4,3) which is on the path between Weaver at (4,2) and my position, or (3,3) area. Actually Phantom is at (3,3) so can't trap there. Place trap at (4,3) to block Weaver's advance northward toward us. Then move to (5,5) to keep distance from Weaver while maintaining area control.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and at (3,3), distance 2 - within my range. I'm at (4,2). I can attack Phantom directly. But better: place a trap between Phantom and my allies. Ghost is wounded at (3,2) and needs protection. Marksman at (5,4) threatens from range. I should move to (5,3) to get closer to Marksman and place a trap at (4,3) or (5,4) to intercept. Actually, Phantom at (3,3) is already in attack range from current position. Let me attack Phantom first to finish it off (it's wounded), then move toward Marksman. Attack range is adjacent only - Phantom is at dist 2, so attack won't work. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Phantom is at dist 2, won't hit. Trap can be placed at range ≤2 on empty tile. I should place trap at (4,3) to intercept Phantom moving south, or at (3,3) directly on Phantom - but that's occupied. Place trap at (4,3) which is on Phantom's likely path toward allies. Then move to (5,3) to apply denial pressure toward Marksman.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Ghost 2/4, Weaver 6/9, Phantom 2/4, Marksman 5/5, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(3,3) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,3) facing N, and I'm already behind them at (3,2). Breach is on cooldown so I can't use it. Shadow_strike deals 1 damage while keeping cloak — but I'm not cloaked. I have 2HP so I need to be careful. Phantom is wounded, so shadow_strike could finish them or leave them near death. Using shadow_strike keeps no cloak benefit since I'm not cloaked. Regular attack also does 1 damage. Shadow_strike is better since it doesn't break cloak (though I have none). I'll shadow_strike Phantom to finish them off, then consider repositioning. After striking, I should move away from danger — the trap at (4,3) and Marksman at (5,4) are threats.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move north toward Marksman. I'm at (3,3) at 1HP — very fragile. Bulwark is adjacent at (2,3). Moving north to (3,4) gets me closer to Marksman at (5,4) without triggering trap at (4,3). I should avoid engaging since I'm at 1HP. Just move north and wait.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Weaver at (5,3) which is blocking my abilities (denial zone). I need to move away first to escape the denial zone, then use precision_shot. Valid moves: (4,3) has a trap, (4,4) is safe and moves me away from Weaver. From (4,4) I'd be at dist 2 from Weaver - in range for precision_shot. Moving to (4,4) then shooting Weaver at (5,3).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,4) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is at (3,4) dist=2, critical but not adjacent. Marksman at (4,4) is healthy. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) which is valuable. Moving to (3,3) puts me closer to Phantom and between enemies and allies. From (3,3) I could use shield_wall facing N/E to protect allies. Stay fortified by not moving, or advance to threaten. Actually, if I move I lose fortify. Phantom is critical — Ghost already acted so Phantom may be nearly dead. Better to hold position, use shield_wall facing E to block damage from Marksman/Phantom direction toward allies.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(5,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Enemy Weaver is at (5,3), dist=2 — in range for pulse or attack. I'm at (5,5). Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Weaver at (5,3), enabling denial to block their abilities. Then I can pulse to hit Weaver (and potentially anyone else within 1 tile). Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of my position — from (5,4), that's (5,3) which is Weaver. Marksman is at (4,4) — also within 1 tile of (5,4), so I'd hit ally. Better to stay at (5,5) and use pulse from here: Weaver at (5,3) is dist=2, outside pulse range (1 tile). Attack range is adjacent only. Trap: I can place a trap at range ≤2 tiles on empty tile. (5,4) is empty and within 2 tiles — placing trap there blocks Weaver's advance toward me. Or I could move to (4,5) and trap (4,3) — but (4,3) already has a trap. Move to (5,4) to get adjacent to Weaver for denial, then pulse from (5,4) hits Weaver at (5,3). But Marksman at (4,4) is also 1 tile from (5,4) — would hit ally. Avoid that. Stay at (5,5), place trap at (5,4) to block Weaver's path north. Then wait or attack isn't in range. Best: trap at (5,4) to deny Weaver movement path, then move to (4,5) to reposition.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Marksman is at (4,4), dist 2, in range. There's already a trap at (4,3). I'm at (5,3) facing north. I should attack Marksman who is healthy and close. Then I can move to (5,4) to get closer to Weaver/Phantom cluster or place a trap to cut off movement. Actually, better to place a trap at (5,4) or (4,4) area to control the chokepoint. Wait - I can attack Marksman directly (dist 2, my range is 2). Then move to (5,4) to pressure the enemy cluster. Or place trap first at (5,4) to block retreat. Marksman is healthy so dealing damage is priority. Attack Marksman, then move to (5,5) to threaten Weaver or place trap. Actually move to (5,4) first to stay safe from the existing trap at (4,3), then attack Marksman from (5,4) - dist would be sqrt(1+0)=1, still in range. Let me attack first from current position, then move.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Ghost 2/4, Weaver 5/9, Phantom 1/4, Marksman 5/5, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 5 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is critical and at (3,4) facing N — behind tile is (3,3). I can move to (3,3) and breach Phantom (I'm already behind if I reach that tile). That finishes them off since they're critical. Move to (3,3) first, then breach Phantom at (3,4).
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (3,4) with 1HP — very fragile. Valid moves include (3,5) which is away from enemies (Ghost at 3,3, Bulwark at 2,3) and toward the top edge. Then I can move to (1,5) or (2,5) to get further from combat. Let me move to (3,5) first, then (1,5) to reach the far edge away from enemies.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded at dist=2, priority target. Weaver(vector) is also wounded at dist=2. I'm at (4,4) facing W. Ghost at (3,3) is in range for precision_shot (dist=2). I haven't moved yet so no movement penalty. Fire precision_shot on Ghost to finish off the wounded specter. Then I can move to maintain distance from enemies closing in. Moving to (3,5) keeps me away from the trap at (4,3) and the enemy Weaver at (5,3). Actually, staying put is fine — I'm not adjacent to my ally Weaver(vector) at (4,5) which is 1 tile away... wait, (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4). The caution says Weaver is 2 tiles away so it must be recalculated. The system says Weaver @(4,5) is 2 tiles away (distance = |4-4|+|5-4|=1... that's 1 tile). But the caution says 2 tiles. I'll trust the caution. Fire precision_shot on Ghost (wounded, high value specter) first without moving to get full 2dmg. Then move away from enemies.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) fortified with 7/8 HP. Enemies are at dist 3 - Phantom at (1,5) and Marksman at (3,5). My ally Weaver is wounded at (5,3). I need to push forward to intercept threats. Moving to (2,5) puts me adjacent to both Phantom and Marksman, letting me attack and shield_wall. But that costs my fortify bonus. Alternatively, move to (2,4) to get closer while staying fortified next turn. Actually, moving to (2,5) gets me adjacent to Marksman at (3,5) - I can attack them. Phantom at (1,5) would also be adjacent. Let me advance to (2,5) and attack Marksman.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,5) ✗ Position occupied → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with Bulwark 2 tiles away at (2,5). Enemy Weaver is at (5,3) wounded. There are already traps at (4,3) and (5,4). I should place a trap to control the approach routes. Moving to (3,4) would let me place a trap closer to Bulwark's path, but I'm adjacent to enemy Weaver's denial range if I move to (5,4) or (5,5). Valid moves include (3,4) which gets me between Bulwark and my allies. Actually, Bulwark is at (2,5) moving toward my team. I should place a trap on a likely path. From current position (4,5), I can trap within 2 tiles - so I can trap (2,5) where Bulwark stands for 2dmg, or trap a tile they might move through. Bulwark is healthy so hitting them with a trap is good. Trap at (2,5) would damage Bulwark if they stay or step on it. But traps go on empty tiles - if Bulwark is there, it's not empty. Place trap at (3,5) to block their advance path, then move to safety. Wait - I need to check if adjacent to enemy Vector blocks trap. Enemy Weaver is at (5,3), dist=3, not adjacent. Allied Weaver is me. So I can place trap. Place trap at (3,5) - directly in Bulwark's path west. Then move to (3,4) to maintain distance.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with traps already at (4,3) and (5,4). Weaver is at (3,4) 3 tiles away - I need to stay out of denial range (adjacent). Marksman is at (3,5) heading toward our area. I should move to (4,4) to be closer to the action but careful - that's adjacent to trap at (4,3). Wait, (4,4) is a valid move. From there I could threaten more. But actually I should place a new trap to further control the approach. Moving to (5,5) gives me high ground position and I can place a trap at (4,5) to block the corridor between Marksman/Weaver and our ally Bulwark at (2,5). Let me move to (5,5) then place trap at (4,5) to create a trap corridor - enemies approaching from (3,5) area would hit it.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Weaver 5/9, Phantom 1/4, Marksman 4/5, Weaver 9/9 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (1,5) with 1HP — very fragile. Moving to (0,4) then (0,3) gets me to the west edge and away from the fight.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark(sentinel) is adjacent at (2,5) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but the warning is about Vector not Sentinel. However, I'm adjacent to Bulwark at dist=1, and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles but deals 1dmg if moved. Better to move away first to maintain distance per orders, then use precision_shot. Moving to (4,5) puts me at dist=2 from Bulwark and dist=1 from enemy Weaver at (5,5). Instead, move to (4,4) to stay at range 2 from Bulwark and dist=2 from enemy Weaver — but (4,3) has a trap. Move to (4,5) keeps me at range 2 from Bulwark and range 1 from Weaver (adjacent, blocks precision_shot). Better: move to (3,3) — dist from Bulwark=~2.8, but valid moves don't include (3,3) wait it does. Actually valid moves: [1,5],[2,4],[3,3],[4,4],[4,5]. Move to (4,4): dist to Bulwark=~2.8, dist to Weaver(5,5)=~1.4. Move to (2,4): dist to Bulwark=1, still close. Best: stay at (3,5) or move to (4,4). At (4,4) I can precision_shot Bulwark at dist~2.8 — out of range2. At current pos (3,5), Bulwark is dist=1 (adjacent) so I can use attack or suppressing_fire. Weaver at (5,5) is dist=2 — wounded, high value target. Fire precision_shot at Weaver first (dist=2, in range, not adjacent to it), then move to (4,5) to maintain distance from Bulwark.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,5) with 7/8 HP. Marksman is 2 tiles east at (4,5) and enemy Weaver is at (3,4). No enemies are adjacent so I can't attack. My ally Weaver is at (5,5) wounded. The Marksman at (4,5) threatens my ally Weaver. I should move toward (3,5) to get closer to Marksman and intercept threats, then use shield_wall toward the east to protect ally Weaver from Marksman. Moving to (3,5) keeps me between enemies and ally without losing fortify next turn if I stay still. Actually, if I move I lose fortify. Better to stay fortified and use shield_wall to protect ally Weaver from Marksman coming from the east. Shield_wall can protect adjacent allies - but Weaver is at (5,5), 3 tiles away, not adjacent. I need to move closer. Move to (3,5) puts me 2 tiles from Weaver still not adjacent. Valid moves include (3,5). Moving to (2,4) or (2,3) gets me closer to enemies but away from ally. Let me move to (3,5) to close distance on Marksman at (4,5) - now they'd be 1 tile away and I could attack next turn. After moving to (3,5), use intercept on ally Weaver at (5,5) - wait, intercept range is ≤2 tiles and Weaver would be 2 tiles from (3,5). I could intercept to protect Weaver from Marksman. But intercept uses move+ability so I'd need to not have moved. Since I'm moving first, I can't also use intercept. Move to (3,5), then wait - saving intercept. Or stay and use intercept now - Weaver is at (5,5), distance 3 from me at (2,5), out of intercept range (≤2). Best: move to (3,5) to position between Marksman and ally, then wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,5) - I'm in denial range blocking their abilities. I should attack Bulwark for 1 damage, then place a trap to control the area. Enemy Weaver at (5,5) is wounded and 3 tiles away. Traps already at (4,3) and (5,4). I can place a trap at (2,5) or (4,4) to control approach routes. Attack Bulwark first, then place trap at (2,4) to block ally Phantom's flank.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is adjacent (1 tile away) and wounded - attack for damage. I'm at 3/9 HP so I need to be careful. After attacking, I can't place traps while adjacent to enemy Weaver at dist 3 (not adjacent, so traps are fine). But wait - Marksman is at (4,5) and I'm at (5,5), so they're adjacent. I should attack Marksman to finish them off while they're wounded. Then move to (5,3) to avoid being flanked and place myself near existing trap at (5,4). Actually, attack first then move away from Marksman's position.

### Turn 7 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 1HP and ordered to move away from allies and toward the map edge, I should retreat to the bottom-left corner. I'm at (0,3) facing S. Moving to (0,0) would be ideal but that's 3 tiles down — I can reach (0,0) in one move of 3. That gets me to the corner, far from combat.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 2HP, adjacent to Bulwark sentinel at (3,5). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Bulwark is a sentinel not a Vector, so precision_shot should work. However, I'm at distance 1 from Bulwark which is adjacent. I need to check: precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and needs LoS, but is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Bulwark is a sentinel, not a vector, so precision_shot is available. But wait - I moved this turn? The turn indicator shows I'm the current actor. I should move away first to avoid being adjacent, then use precision_shot for 2dmg. Valid moves include (5,5) which keeps distance from Bulwark at (3,5) = 2 tiles away. From (5,5), Bulwark at (3,5) is distance 2, still in range for precision_shot. Enemy Weaver(vector) at (5,3) is nearby - moving to (5,5) puts me 2 tiles from it, not adjacent. Also note traps at (4,3),(5,4),(4,4) - avoid those. Move to (5,5) then precision_shot Bulwark. After moving, precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). Actually staying put and using precision_shot for 2dmg is better since I haven't moved yet - but I'm adjacent to Bulwark which may be dangerous. Orders say maintain distance. Move to (5,5) first, then suppressing_fire or precision_shot on Bulwark at distance 2.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Weaver is adjacent at (3,4) — I can attack it directly. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction, which is valuable to maintain. Attacking the Weaver removes its DENIAL zone blocking my abilities. Marksman is at (5,5) dist=2, out of melee range. I'll attack the adjacent Weaver, then wait to keep fortify active.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,5). I can attack it for 1dmg and deny its abilities. The trap cluster at (4,3),(4,4),(5,4) covers the east side. I should place a trap to the west to cover Phantom's approach corridor, but first let me attack Bulwark since it's healthy and adjacent. After attacking, I could move west to avoid being too close to the enemy Weaver. Actually, I should attack Bulwark first (denial is active on it), then move to (2,4) to maintain distance from enemy Weaver while staying near center. Note: trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — but enemy Weaver is at dist 3 so trap placement should work. However Bulwark is adjacent so I need to check if Bulwark's adjacency blocks trap... the rule is 'trap blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' — Bulwark is a sentinel not a vector, so trap should work. Place trap at (2,5) to cover western approach toward Phantom, then attack Bulwark.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 3HP, wounded. Marksman is at (5,5) distance 2 — within my range 2. There's already a trap at (5,4) between me and Marksman, which may trigger if they move toward me. Weaver enemy is at (3,4), 3 tiles away — I need to stay away from them or my abilities get blocked. I should attack Marksman who is wounded and in range. Then I can move to (4,2) to reposition away from the trap at (4,3) and maintain distance from enemy Weaver. Actually, let me attack Marksman first (in range at dist=2), then move to (5,2) to get away from the trap at (5,4) and the Marksman.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 1HP I'm critically wounded and both enemies are far away (dist 7-8). No enemies in range. I should move toward the enemy Weaver at (5,2) as it's the closer threat and I'm cloaked. Best path is to move toward center-board. From (0,0) I can move up to 3 tiles. Moving to (3,0) gets me closer to Weaver at (5,2) - dist would be 4. No ability targets available this turn.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark(sentinel) is 2 tiles away at (3,5) — within precision_shot range and I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. Bulwark is wounded, so 2dmg could finish it. I'm not adjacent to enemy Weaver so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire on Bulwark first, then consider position. After shooting, I can move — but (4,4) and (5,4) are traps. Safe moves are (4,5) but that's also close to Bulwark. Stay at (5,5) or move to (5,3) to keep distance from Bulwark and angle on enemy Weaver at (5,2) but that's only dist1 which puts me adjacent — bad. Stay put after firing.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Weaver is adjacent at (3,4) and in range. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and should attack the adjacent Weaver. After attacking, I'll stay put to maintain fortify bonus — moving would lose it. Weaver has DENIAL active but basic attack still works.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 3HP, wounded. Traps already at (4,3) and (5,4). Marksman is at (5,5) dist=3, wounded - dangerous. I need to avoid the traps at (4,3) and (5,4). I can move to (5,3) but there's a trap at (5,4) nearby. Moving to (4,2) keeps me away from traps and positions me to place a new trap at (4,3)... wait, trap already there. Let me place a trap at (5,1) to control the southern corridor, then move to (4,2) to be less exposed. Actually, I should move first then trap. Move to (4,2) - avoids existing traps - then place trap at (4,1) or (3,2) to create a choke between enemy Weaver at (3,4) and Phantom at (3,0). Trap at (4,1) would cover the path from (3,0) Phantom moving north. Valid moves include (4,2) and (4,1). Move to (4,2), then trap at (4,1) to catch Phantom if they advance.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,5) — wounded sentinel, good target for pulse to deal AoE damage. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile of target, so targeting (3,4) or adjacent cell would hit Bulwark. Actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of ME (range 1 AoE centered on self). That hits Bulwark at dist 1. After pulse, move away from Bulwark to avoid getting hit and to place a trap. Many trap tiles are already placed. Valid move tiles include (2,4) which keeps distance from Weaver and Bulwark. Need to avoid stepping on traps at (4,3),(5,4),(4,4),(2,5). Move to (2,4) is safe.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,0) with only 1HP — extremely vulnerable. The enemy Weaver is at (4,2), distance 3, which means I can't reach it this turn. I need to stay alive and reposition. Moving toward (4,1) gets me closer to Weaver without being adjacent to it (avoiding ability block). Next turn I could shadow_strike. But at 1HP, I should be cautious. Let me move to (4,1) to close distance on Weaver for a potential shadow_strike next turn, staying out of adjacent range for now.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical at distance 2 — precision_shot can finish it. I'm not adjacent to enemy Vector (Weaver at dist=4), so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved yet, so full 2dmg applies. Bulwark is the priority target. After shooting, I should consider repositioning — (5,4) and (4,4) are trapped, so avoid those. (4,5) is valid but moves me closer to Bulwark. Stay at (5,5) or move to (5,3) to avoid traps. Actually, shoot first then assess — if Bulwark goes down, threat reduced. I'll shoot first, then move to (5,3) to avoid trap at (5,4) and maintain distance from enemy Weaver.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction — staying put is safest. Enemy Weaver is at (2,4) dist=2, not adjacent so I can't attack. Marksman is at dist=4, also out of range. My ally Weaver is at (4,2). I should hold position to keep fortify bonus and use shield_wall toward the enemy Weaver approaching from the west/south to protect myself and allies. Shield_wall toward S or W would intercept incoming threats from (2,4) direction.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 3HP, wounded. Marksman is adjacent at (5,3) and wounded - I can attack or pulse. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - only Marksman at dist=2 is not within 1 tile of me currently. Attack reaches Marksman at dist=2. Enemy Weaver is far at dist=4. I should move to (5,2) to get adjacent to Marksman and use pulse to hit them, or just attack from current position since Marksman is at dist=2 and in range. Actually, attack range is adjacent only (dist=1), but recon shows Marksman in range at dist=2 - wait, the system says attack is adjacent only but recon says Marksman at dist=2 is in range. Let me re-read: 'attack(1dmg, range:adjacent only)' but recon shows inRange=true for Marksman at dist=2. The range might be calculated differently. I'll trust the recon data. I should also consider placing a trap. I can't trap while adjacent to enemy Vector, but Weaver is at dist=4 so that's fine. Place trap at (4,3) - wait, there's already a trap there. Place trap at (3,3) to block the path. Then attack Marksman. Actually with 3HP I need to be careful. Let me place a trap to control space and attack the wounded Marksman.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical at (3,5) and within range 2. I can attack it directly from (2,4) — wait, attack is adjacent only. I need to move adjacent to Bulwark to attack. (2,5) has a trap so can't go there. (3,4) is a valid move and puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (3,5). From (3,4) I can attack Bulwark. Also, placing a trap at (2,5) would be blocked since there's already one there. Let me move to (3,4) to get adjacent to Bulwark and attack to finish it off — it's critical so even 1 damage should eliminate it.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Weaver(vector) is at (4,2), wounded, distance 2. I'm at (5,3) with 2HP. I have a clean precision_shot opportunity — target is in range, I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. My ally Weaver is at (3,4), 2 tiles away — I must avoid moving adjacent to them. Trap at (5,4) so I can't move north. Best play: fire precision_shot first for 2dmg (likely finishing the wounded enemy), then consider positioning. If I fire first without moving, I get full damage. After firing, I can move to (5,2) to maintain distance and avoid traps.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Weaver is at (4,2) critical HP, dist=3. My ally Marksman is at (5,2) wounded. Traps already at (4,3),(5,4),(4,4),(2,5). I need to protect Marksman and block enemy approach. Enemy likely moving toward Marksman. Key chokepoint is (3,3) or (3,2) to intercept enemy path. Moving to (3,3) keeps me 2 tiles from enemy (safe from denial) and lets me place a trap at (4,3)... but (4,3) already has a trap. I should move to (3,3) then place trap at (4,2) to block enemy - but enemy is there. Move to (3,3) and trap at (3,2) to create a barrier between enemy and ally path. Actually, moving to (2,3) keeps distance and I can trap (3,3) as a chokepoint. Or move to (3,3) and trap (4,3) - already trapped. Let me move to (3,3) and place trap at (3,2) to cover the approach lane.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,2) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical situation. Marksman is adjacent at (5,2) wounded. I need to either attack for the kill or escape. Attack Marksman first since they're wounded and adjacent - this could eliminate them. Then move away from Weaver who is at (3,3) in denial range. Moving to (3,1) puts distance from Weaver while escaping.
