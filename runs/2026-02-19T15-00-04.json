Foresight shows Warden attacked (4,5) last turn - if I move to (4,5) I may get attacked. Better to stay or move elsewhere. Actually I can move to (5,5) to maintain range and avoid traps. Warden is adjacent to me at dist 2, not adjacent (dist 1), so scan is not blocked. But scan already done on Warden. No other enemies in range. I'll move to (5,5) to avoid trap at (5,4)... wait (5,4) is a trap, (5,5) is valid. Then recalibrate an ally - but recalibrate is adjacent only. At (4,4) who is adjacent? Need to check. Foresight shows Doc at (5,5) last turn. I'll move to (4,5) - but Warden attacked there last turn, risky. Move to (5,5) instead and wait since no scan targets available.",
