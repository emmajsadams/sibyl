## Squads
### Player
- **Lattice** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
### Opponent
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Doc** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away. I should advance toward my frontliners to stay in support range. Moving to (4,4) keeps me close to Veil at (3,4) and positions me to overclock or heal next turn. No abilities needed this turn.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(2,1) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range from current position. Bolt is at dist=4 but marked inRange:false, so I need to move closer. Moving to (2,2) would put me at dist=1 from Bolt at (2,1) — too close and dangerous. Let me move to (2,3) to get closer to Bolt and potentially bring them into scan range. From (2,3), dist to Bolt at (2,1) = 2, well within scan range of 4. I should also check Lattice — I need to avoid being adjacent to any Vector. Lattice is at (4,1), dist from (2,3) = 4, not adjacent. Safe to scan Bolt from (2,3).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at dist=4, exactly at scan range, but only from a closer position. From (1,0) with mv3, I can reach (1,3) which puts me at dist=2 from Watcher at (2,3) — well within scan range. Moving north to (1,3) then scanning Watcher reveals their strategy and deals 1 damage. Bolt is my damage dealer at (2,1), but recalibrate is adjacent-only so I'd need to be next to Bolt first — scanning Watcher is higher priority this turn.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(3,4) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Then advance toward the enemy striker Bolt at (2,1) who is the priority damage dealer. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer while staying cloaked. No enemies in range yet, no adjacent Vector to block cloak.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (2,3), distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I'm at (2,1) facing N. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Fire first, then assess. No adjacent enemies so precision_shot is not blocked.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Doc is at (4,4) directly north - likely to advance toward me along column 4. I should move north to (4,3) to get closer while placing a trap on (4,4) or on a likely approach tile. Wait - Doc is already at (4,4), so I should trap a tile they'll move through. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Doc at (4,4) which is risky. Better to move to (4,2) and place a trap at (4,3) - a tile Doc must pass through to reach me. Watcher at (2,3) might move toward my allies. Trapping (4,3) covers Doc's likely advance path.
  State: Bolt 3/4, Lattice 9/9, Insight 6/6, Veil 4/4, Watcher 4/6, Doc 16/16

### Turn 2 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher is wounded (4/6 HP) and 3 tiles away. I need to close distance to heal. Moving to (3,3) gets me adjacent to Watcher at (2,3) — dist=1, which is adjacent. Lattice is at (4,2) — if I move to (3,3), distance to Lattice is 2, so not adjacent, abilities won't be blocked. Then I can patch Watcher.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(1,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Insight(oracle) just scanned me at dist=1, revealing my prompt. Priority: scan Insight back to reveal their prompt and deal 1dmg. Insight is adjacent at (1,3), but I need to check if Lattice blocks scan - Lattice is at (4,2), dist=3, not adjacent to me so scan is not blocked. Scanning Insight at dist=1 is valid. After scanning, I should reposition away from Insight who is adjacent and dangerous. Move to (2,4) to gain distance from Insight while staying in range of other enemies.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone first. Priority target is Bolt (striker, damage dealer) at (2,1). I can reach (2,0) which is behind Bolt — perfect for breach next turn, or shadow_strike now. Move to (2,0) first to get behind Bolt, then shadow_strike to stay cloaked and deal damage.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is unscanned and adjacent at dist=2 - high value target. Watcher is already scanned. Foresight shows Watcher will scan (2,1) where Bolt is - need to recalibrate Bolt. But recalibrate is adjacent only and Bolt is at (2,1), too far. Doc at (3,3) is priority scan target. After scanning Doc, I could recalibrate Bolt by moving closer, but Bolt is at (2,1) and I'm at (1,3) - dist=3, too far for recalibrate. Better to scan Doc for intel, then move to stay safe. Veil is at dist=4 - out of scan range per recon. Scan Doc now.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil(specter) is adjacent at (2,0) - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Veil is a specter not a Vector, so precision_shot should work. However I'm at 2HP, and Veil is healthy. If I use precision_shot from current position without moving, I deal 2dmg which would badly wound Veil. I should NOT move first (moving reduces precision_shot to 1dmg). Stay put and fire precision_shot on Veil for 2dmg.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Doc is at (3,3) within range 2. I already have a trap at (4,3). Doc is adjacent to my trap - if they step on it, 2dmg. I should place another trap on a likely approach tile. Doc at (3,3) might move toward Bolt at (2,1) or toward me. Tile (3,2) is between Doc and the action - good trap location. I can move to (5,2) to reposition and maintain distance, then place trap at (3,2) to threaten Doc's movement path. Wait - I can place trap at range ≤2 from current position (4,2). (3,2) is dist 2, valid. But I need to check if adjacent enemy blocks trap - Doc is at (3,3), dist 2 from me, not adjacent. So trap is allowed. Place trap at (3,2) to block Doc's southward movement, then move to (5,2) to stay at range and avoid being surrounded.
  State: Bolt 2/4, Lattice 9/9, Insight 5/6, Veil 3/4, Watcher 6/6, Doc 15/16

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(2,1) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded, adjacent, and I'm already behind them (I'm at 2,0, Bolt faces N, behind tile is 2,0). Breach is ready and would make Bolt obey me next turn — but shadow_strike deals damage while keeping any cloak state, and Bolt is already wounded. Actually I'm not cloaked (cloak was used earlier and I'm visible). Priority: assassinate the enemy damage dealer. Bolt is wounded and right in front of me. Use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage — if Bolt is wounded that likely finishes them. Then I can reposition toward other threats.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(0,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Both Bolt and Insight are already scanned. Bolt is critical at dist=3 — I can scan again to deal 1 damage and potentially finish it, but Veil just used shadow_strike on Bolt so it may already be dead. More valuable: Insight is healthy at dist=3 and already scanned. I should recalibrate an ally to boost effectiveness. Doc is adjacent-ish at (3,3) — dist=1 from (2,4) to (3,3) is not adjacent (dist=2 diagonal). Actually dist from (2,4) to (3,3) = |2-3|+|4-3| = 1+1=2, not adjacent. Veil is at (1,2), dist from (2,4) = 1+2=3, not adjacent. No ally is adjacent for recalibrate. Best action: scan Insight to deal 1 damage (already have prompt, but 1 damage is useful). Then move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Doc for future recalibrate, or move closer to allies. Actually move to (3,3) first then scan Insight at dist |3-0|+|3-3|=3 ≤4, valid. Or scan first from current pos (dist=3 valid), then move. Scan Insight first (1 dmg), then move to (3,3) to be near Doc.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(1,2) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Veil used shadow_strike on Bolt last turn — Bolt is critical and needs help. Doc will patch (2,3) this turn. Watcher is scanning our positions. Priority: scan Veil to track after potential cloak, then recalibrate Bolt to boost his damage output. Veil is at (1,2), dist=2, in scan range. After scanning, I can move to (1,3) to be closer to Bolt for recalibrate next turn, but that puts me adjacent to Veil — risky. Better to stay put or move to (1,4) to stay safe. Actually, scan first then move to (1,4) to maintain range and safety.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → patch(1,2) ✓
  💭 Veil is critically wounded at 2/4 HP and needs a heal urgently. Veil is at (1,2) which is distance 3 from me. I need to move closer to heal. Moving to (2,3) puts me at distance 2 from Veil - still not adjacent. Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Veil at (1,2) - distance 1, that's adjacent. Check: (2,2) to (1,2) = dist 1, yes adjacent. Also need to stay away from Lattice at (5,2) - moving to (2,2) keeps me 3+ tiles away, safe. From (2,2) I can patch Veil at (1,2).
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Doc is adjacent at (2,2) and Veil is at dist 2. I need to survive. Doc adjacent means precision_shot is blocked if enemy Vector is adjacent, but Doc is a medic not Vector - wait, precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically. Doc is a medic, so precision_shot should still work. But I'm at 1HP and Doc is adjacent (dist=1). If I use precision_shot on Veil at dist 2, that's valid (no enemy Vector adjacent). But Doc will likely attack me next turn and I'm already at 1HP. I should retreat first to break adjacency with Doc, then shoot. Move to (3,1) to get distance from Doc and Veil, then use precision_shot on Veil or Doc. Actually Doc is at (2,2), dist=1 - I can target Doc with precision_shot since dist=1 is within range 2. But if I move first, I deal 1dmg (moved penalty). Let me shoot Doc first with precision_shot (2dmg, no move penalty) to eliminate the healer, then move away. Doc at (2,2) dist=1, in range, no enemy Vector adjacent to me.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies are clustered around (1-2, 2-4). Doc is at (2,2), Veil at (1,2) - they may advance east toward our allies. Bolt is critical at (3,1) and needs protection. Traps at (4,3) and (3,2) already placed. I should move west to close distance and place a trap on a likely enemy approach path. Moving to (4,2) keeps me near Bolt and lets me place a trap at (3,2)... but (3,2) already has a trap. Place at (4,1) to guard the corridor toward Bolt, or move to (4,2) and trap (3,3) to cover approach from Doc/Veil. Let me move to (4,1) to be adjacent to Bolt for support, then place trap at (3,2) - already trapped. Better: move to (3,2) is blocked by trap. Move to (4,2), place trap at (3,3) to intercept Doc moving east.
  State: Bolt 1/4, Lattice 9/9, Insight 4/6, Veil 4/4, Watcher 6/6, Doc 14/16

### Turn 4 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (2,4) — scan it for intel and deal 1dmg. Then move away to maintain range and avoid Veil closing in. Veil is at (1,2) targeting our striker Bolt who is critical. Watcher was trying to scan me last turn. Priority: scan Watcher now while adjacent, then reposition north or west to stay safe. Note: (3,3) is a trap, avoid it. Move to (0,4) to create distance from Watcher and Veil while staying in scan range of enemies next turn.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at critical HP and is the priority target. I can move to (2,1) which puts me behind Bolt (facing E, so west is behind) and adjacent for shadow_strike. This lets me finish off Bolt without breaking cloak. Move to (2,1), then shadow_strike Bolt at (3,1).
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → patch(2,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is wounded at (2,4) but not adjacent (dist=2). I need to move closer to heal. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Watcher at (2,4) and keeps me away from Lattice at (4,2). From (2,3), Watcher is adjacent so I can use patch. Veil is at full HP, no heal needed there.
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Insight is already scanned and in range at dist=2. Lattice is at dist=4 which is exactly scan range but the recon shows it's out of range from current position. I should recalibrate an ally to boost their effectiveness, or scan Lattice if I move closer. Doc is adjacent at (2,3) and could benefit from recalibrate. Let me recalibrate Doc to boost their healing effectiveness, then consider repositioning. Actually, Veil is our damage dealer at (2,1) - recalibrating Veil would be more impactful. But Veil is at dist=3, not adjacent. Doc at (2,3) is adjacent (dist=1). I'll recalibrate Doc with tactical advice about Lattice's trap placement, then move to safety.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 I have traps at (4,3), (3,2), (3,3). Veil is at (2,1) and Doc is at (2,3), both dist=3. They may advance toward me. Moving west to (3,2) would put me on my own trap - avoid that. I can move to (3,1) to get closer to Veil and pressure the approach corridor, then place a trap at (2,2) to cover the path between Veil and Doc.
  State: Lattice 9/9, Insight 4/6, Veil 4/4, Watcher 6/6, Doc 14/16 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I have Watcher (dist 2) and Doc (dist 3) in scan range. Watcher is the enemy oracle providing intel and recalibrating allies - high priority to disrupt. I already know Watcher's prompt. Doc is healing and overclocking - also high value. My orders say scan priority targets. Watcher is at (1,5) dist 2, within scan range 4. I should scan Doc since I already know Watcher's prompt - wait, I know all enemy prompts already. Better to deal damage. Scan does 1dmg and reveals prompt (already known). I can scan Doc at (2,3) for 1 damage. Then I should reposition - Veil is flanking Lattice, tried shadow_strike on Lattice last turn. I'm at (0,4) with 4/6 HP. Moving closer risks adjacency to Veil if it closes in. Lattice placed a trap at (2,2). I'll scan Doc for chip damage, then move to (2,4) to stay in good scan range for next turn while avoiding trap squares.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → recalibrate(2,3) ✓
  💭 Insight is already scanned and in range at dist=2. I should recalibrate an ally to boost effectiveness, then consider repositioning. Veil is attacking Lattice — recalibrate could help. But recalibrate is adjacent-only, and Veil is at (2,1) — too far. Doc is at (2,3) — also not adjacent. I could move toward Doc first to recalibrate, but my orders say scan priority and stay safe. Insight is already scanned. Lattice is out of scan range. I should recalibrate Doc (medic) to improve patching, but need to be adjacent. If I move to (1,3) I'm adjacent to Doc at (2,3). Actually wait — move first to (1,4) puts me at dist=1 to Doc at (2,3)? (1,4) to (2,3) = dist=2. Move to (2,4) would be adjacent to Doc but that's Insight's current position — risky. Let me move to (1,4) to stay safe, then recalibrate... no, (1,4) to (2,3) is diagonal=not adjacent in cardinal terms — dist=sqrt(2) so probably adjacent. Actually for grid adjacency usually cardinal only. (1,3) would be adjacent to Doc at (2,3) — that's 1 tile east. Move to (1,3) puts me adjacent to Doc, then recalibrate Doc with tactical addendum. But Insight last turn moved to (0,4) — Foresight shows that. So Insight may not be at (2,4) anymore... but current position says (2,4). Foresight shows LAST turn actions. So Insight was at some position, moved to (0,4)... but current data says Insight @(2,4). Recalibrate Doc: move to (1,3) first (adjacent to Doc at (2,3)), then recalibrate. (1,3) is in valid moves. This gives Doc a tactical boost.
- **Veil** (specter): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone so cloak/breach are blocked. I can basic attack Lattice from current position, or move to (3,2) which is behind Lattice and then breach next turn. Orders say prioritize the enemy damage dealer (Insight, oracle). But I can't reach Insight this turn. Lattice is adjacent and I'm in denial zone. Best play: move to (3,2) to get behind Lattice, then attack. This positions me behind Lattice for a breach next turn while dealing damage. Actually, I should just attack Lattice now (basic attack works in denial zone) then move to (3,2) to be behind for breach next turn.
- **Doc** (medic): attack(2,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Veil is wounded at (3,2) but I can't heal. Insight is adjacent at (2,4) — I should attack it. I could also overclock Veil to help them fight, but Veil is at dist=2 (not adjacent). I need to get adjacent to Veil to overclock. Moving to (3,3) is a trap tile — avoid. Moving to (2,2) would put me closer to Veil at (3,2) — dist=1, adjacent. But orders warn about precision_shot at (2,2). Let me attack Insight first since it's adjacent, then consider movement. Attacking Insight (2,4) deals 1 damage. Then I could move to (3,4) to reposition or stay. Actually, I should attack Insight then move toward Veil to set up overclock next turn — but I can't overclock this turn unless I'm already adjacent. Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Veil at (3,2)? No, dist would be 2. Moving to (2,2) gets me adjacent to Veil at (3,2) — dist=1. But (2,2) had precision_shot warning. I'll attack Insight first, then move to (3,3)... no that's a trap. Move to (3,4) to reposition safely.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,1) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (3,2) - that's dangerous as a specter likely has cloak. My Denial passive blocks cloak since they're adjacent, which is good. I have traps at (3,3) and (4,3) already covering northern approach. I should pulse Veil now since they're adjacent (1 tile range) to deal 1 damage to all units within 1 tile. Then move south or sideways to avoid being in melee next turn. Watcher and Doc are too far for immediate threat. Pulse hits Veil at (3,2) from my position (3,1) - they're within 1 tile. Check: pulse range is 1 tile AoE centered on me, so it hits all units within 1 tile of me. Veil is at distance 1, so yes they get hit. No allies are adjacent so no friendly fire risk.
  State: Lattice 8/9, Insight 3/6, Veil 2/4, Watcher 6/6, Doc 13/16 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 6 — player
- **Doc** (medic): attack(2,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is at (3,2) at 2/4 HP and needs healing but I can't help. Insight (oracle, enemy) is adjacent at (2,4) and wounded - I can attack for 1 damage. I can't heal Veil, so attacking the wounded enemy Insight is the best use of my turn. Move isn't necessary since Insight is already in range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Insight is wounded and already scanned - no value in scanning again. Lattice is a vector at dist=3, must stay non-adjacent. I should scan Lattice to reveal its prompt and deal damage. Current position (1,3) has Lattice at dist=3 which is within scan range (≤4). However, scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - Lattice is at dist=3 so not adjacent, scan should work. Scan Lattice first, then consider repositioning. After scan, I could move to maintain safe distance.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) facing N with 2HP. Insight is wounded at (2,4) — priority target. Lattice is at (2,1) facing W, and I'm behind it with (3,1) as the breach tile. Breach cooldown is ready. If I breach Lattice, I control it next turn but I'm at 2HP and exposed. Better to focus on Insight — the wounded damage dealer. I can't reach Insight's behind position (1,4) this turn. I can move toward Insight. Move to (2,3) gets me closer to Insight at dist=2. Then shadow_strike won't reach from there. Let me consider: move to (3,3) then I'm still 2 tiles from Insight at (2,4) — adjacent would be (2,4) or (3,4). Move to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Insight at (2,4) — I can shadow_strike for 1 dmg. Insight is wounded so this could finish or nearly finish them. (2,3) is in valid moves. Shadow_strike keeps cloak. Let's do: move to (2,3), then shadow_strike Insight at (2,4).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → scan(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critically vulnerable. Foresight shows Doc attacked (2,4) last turn — that's my position, meaning they targeted me. Veil is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded. I cannot scan while adjacent to an enemy vector, but Veil is a specter not a vector, so scan should work. However at 1HP, I need to either flee or act decisively. Veil is wounded and adjacent — if I scan them it deals 1 damage (could finish them off if very low). But Doc is coming toward me. Best play: move away from danger first, then scan Watcher (healthy, unknown threat level but prompt already known) or recalibrate Lattice. Actually all enemy prompts are known. I should recalibrate Lattice (at 2,1) — but Lattice is not adjacent. I need to survive. Move to (1,4) to escape Doc's likely advance and Veil's melee range, then scan Watcher to deal damage from safety. Watcher is at distance 3, within scan range of 4. Moving to (1,4) keeps Watcher at distance ~3. Avoid traps at (4,3),(3,3),(2,2).
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(1,3) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Veil is wounded at (2,3), distance 2 — within attack range. I have traps at (2,2) which is between me and Veil. Veil is likely to move south toward me or my ally Insight at (1,4). I should place a trap to cut off escape routes or pressure Veil, then attack. Tile (2,2) already has a trap. I can place a trap at (1,3) to block Veil's western escape, then attack Veil directly. Wait — I'm at (2,1), Veil at (2,3), dist=2 which is within my range 2. I'll attack Veil first to potentially finish them off while wounded, then place a trap on (1,3) to block retreat.
  State: Lattice 7/9, Insight 1/6, Veil 2/4, Watcher 5/6, Doc 13/16 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 7 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is critically wounded at HP 2/4 but I can't heal. I need to get closer to support. Insight (enemy oracle) is at (1,4) distance 3 - I could try to reach adjacent to use overclock on Watcher or Veil if I get close. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer to Veil at (2,3) and puts me adjacent next turn. Avoid (3,3) trap. I'll move to (3,4) to close distance toward Veil, then overclock Veil if adjacent - but dist to Veil from (3,4) would be 1, so I could overclock Veil from (3,4) since Veil is at (2,3). Wait - (3,4) to (2,3) is dist=2, not adjacent. Move to (2,4) instead: dist to Veil at (2,3) = 1, adjacent! I can overclock Veil. Check: (2,4) is in valid moves. Yes. Then overclock Veil at (2,3).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Veil is wounded and targeted me last turn with shadow_strike at (2,4), Doc also attacked (2,4). I need to survive. All enemies already scanned so scan value is lower. Lattice is my ally at (2,1). I should move away from danger. Doc is at (2,4) adjacent, Veil at (2,3) nearby. Moving to (0,5) gets me away from both. From there I can recalibrate Lattice but they're not adjacent. Best move: retreat to (0,5) to survive. Then I can scan Watcher at (0,3) from (0,5) — dist would be 2, still in range. But Watcher already scanned. I should recalibrate Lattice to help them, but they're too far. At (0,5) I'm away from threats. Second action: wait or scan. Watcher is already known. All enemies known. I'll move to safety and wait — survival is priority at 1HP.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(0,5) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Insight is critical HP and within scan range (dist 2). Already have their prompt, so scan again deals 1 dmg which could finish them. But wait — I already scanned Insight, prompt is known. Scan still deals 1 dmg and reveals prompt (redundant but dmg is useful). Insight is at critical HP — scanning them could eliminate them. I'm at (0,3), Insight at (0,5), dist 2, within scan range of 4. Lattice is at dist 4, out of range. Priority: scan Insight to deal 1 dmg (potentially finishing a critical enemy), then move to safety. Foresight shows Insight tried to scan me last turn — they're a threat. Scanning Insight is the right call.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 2HP and OVERCLOCKED (2 ability uses). Lattice (vector) is at (2,1) facing W, dist=2. The behind tile is (3,1) which is reachable. I'm not cloaked currently. With overclocked, I can move to (3,1) to get behind Lattice, then use breach to take control. Breach requires being behind the enemy - (3,1) is adjacent and behind Lattice. This is the perfect assassination setup. Move to (3,1), then breach Lattice.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,1) ✓ → move(3,0) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (3,1) wounded - perfect pulse target. Watcher is also at dist=2 so not in pulse range. I'm at (2,1). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile from my position: that would hit Veil at (3,1) dist=1. That finishes off the wounded Veil. Then I should move to (2,2) to place a trap blocking enemy approach paths, but (2,2) already has a trap. Move to (3,2) instead to control more territory, or stay and place trap elsewhere. Actually pulse first to kill Veil, then move to (4,1) to place a trap on approach routes.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Veil** (specter): attack(3,0) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP adjacent to Lattice who is facing S — I'm already behind them. DENIAL zone blocks cloak/breach, but basic attack works. I need to attack Lattice now since I'm at critical health and they're right there. After attacking I should move away to survive. Actually, with only 1HP I'm about to die — best play is attack Lattice to deal damage then move away to safety.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(3,0) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (3,0), distance 4 from my current position (1,2) — just out of scan range. I need to close distance to scan. Moving to (2,1) puts me at distance ~2.2 from Lattice, within scan range. However, Lattice is a vector — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, and Lattice's denial range is adjacent only, so as long as I'm not adjacent I'm fine. From (2,1), Lattice at (3,0) is distance ~1.4 — that's adjacent! I'd be blocked. Better to move to (3,1) — distance to Lattice(3,0) is 1, also adjacent. Try (2,2): dist to (3,0) = sqrt(1+4) = ~2.2, not adjacent, within scan range 4. Good. Also Veil is critical and was blocked from breach last turn. I could recalibrate Doc or Veil instead, but Veil is at (4,2) — not adjacent to me at (1,2). Doc is at (2,4) — also not adjacent. So recalibrate not viable from current position. Best plan: move to (2,2), then scan Lattice — dist from (2,2) to (3,0) = sqrt(1+4) ≈ 2.2, within range 4, and not adjacent (adjacent = distance 1).
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → overclock(2,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is at (4,2) with 1HP - critically wounded but dist=4, out of reach this turn. Watcher is at (2,2) with 4/6HP, dist=2. I can move toward Watcher and use overclock to give them extra actions. Move to (2,3) to get adjacent to Watcher at (2,2), then overclock them - this lets Watcher act twice next turn which could help the team. Avoid (3,3) which has a trap.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,0) with 5HP, no enemies in range. Traps already placed at (3,3) and (4,3) covering central approach. Veil at (4,2) moving N is critical and likely to push toward me or flank. Watcher at (2,2) and Doc at (2,3) are healthy. I should advance to (3,2) to get closer and then place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (3,1) first keeps me safer while extending trap coverage. Veil moving N from (4,2) might go to (4,1) or (3,2). I'll move to (3,1) and place a trap at (4,1) to catch Veil's likely movement path.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 1HP — critical health. Lattice (vector) is at (3,1) facing N, wounded. I need to get behind Lattice to breach. The behind tile is (3,0). I can move to (3,0) which puts me behind Lattice and adjacent. But I must NOT move adjacent to Lattice first or breach will be blocked. Wait — (3,0) is behind Lattice, dist=1 from Lattice, and Lattice is at (3,1). Moving to (3,0) means I'm adjacent to Lattice. The caution says avoid moving adjacent to Lattice or abilities will be blocked by Vector's denial aura. But Lattice IS the vector. The denial range blocks cloak/breach when adjacent to enemy Vector. So if I move to (3,0) I'll be adjacent to Lattice (vector) and breach will be blocked. I need to breach from (3,0) which is the behind tile, but being adjacent to a vector blocks breach. This is a trap. Alternative: shadow_strike requires adjacent. I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. If I move to (4,1) that's dist=√2 from (3,1)... actually dist to (3,1) from (4,1) is 1 tile diagonal? No, grid distance — (4,1) to (3,1) is 1 tile away, so adjacent. That also puts me adjacent to Lattice and breach blocked. Actually, any adjacent tile to Lattice is within vector denial. Since Lattice is wounded and I have 1HP, maybe shadow_strike is the play — it's 1dmg and keeps cloak (I'm cloaked). But breach IS blocked adjacent to vector. Shadow_strike is an attack ability, not breach/cloak, so it should NOT be blocked by vector denial (denial blocks cloak/breach only). I'll move to (4,1) — adjacent to Lattice at (3,1) — and shadow_strike for 1 damage to finish Lattice. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak.
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Lattice is wounded at (3,1), dist 2 — within scan range. I already know Lattice's prompt, so scanning again is redundant. Doc is adjacent at (2,3) — I could recalibrate. But the bigger value: Lattice is wounded and I have 2 abilities. I can't attack (not adjacent). I should recalibrate Doc to give tactical addendum, then scan Lattice to deal 1 more damage and potentially finish it off. Lattice is at dist 2 so scan range is fine (≤4). I'm not adjacent to Lattice so scan isn't blocked. Stay at current position — valid moves include staying put implicitly. Use both ability charges: recalibrate Doc, then scan Lattice for chip damage.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (2,2) with 4/6 HP and needs healing, but I have 0 patch uses remaining. I cannot heal. I'm currently at (2,3), adjacent to Watcher at (2,2). I can use overclock on Watcher to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could help them deal with Lattice. Lattice is at (3,1), distance 3 from me — safe from denial. After overclocking Watcher, I should reposition slightly to stay safe while keeping support range.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(2,1) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 3HP, facing Watcher at (2,2) dist=2 and Doc at (2,3) dist=3. I have traps at (3,3) and (4,3). Watcher is in range for attack. I should place a trap on a likely movement path - (2,1) or (3,2) would be good chokepoints. Then attack Watcher since it's in range at dist=2. Actually, trap first on (3,2) to block movement, then attack Watcher.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Lattice is wounded at (3,1), 2 tiles away — already scanned so I know their prompt. I should recalibrate Doc at (2,3) to give tactical advice, then scan Lattice again for damage since they're within range 4 and I'm not adjacent to them (distance 2, not adjacent). Wait — scan is blocked when adjacent to Vector, but I'm 2 tiles away so scan should work. Lattice is wounded, dealing 1 more damage via scan could finish them. I'll recalibrate Doc first with useful intel about Lattice's trap behavior, then scan Lattice for the damage.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is wounded at (2,2) at 4/6 HP and needs support, but I have 0 patch uses remaining. I can still use overclock to help Watcher. Watcher is adjacent to me at (2,2) — I'm at (2,3). Overclock gives an adjacent ally 2 abilities next turn. Lattice is at (3,1), distance 3 from me, so not adjacent — overclock is not blocked. I'll overclock Watcher to boost their effectiveness. Then I can move to maintain position or stay near Watcher.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with only 2HP - critically low. Watcher is adjacent at (2,2) and I'm in range. Doc is at (2,3). Traps already placed at (3,3) and (2,1). I should place a trap at (3,2) which is a tile I can move to and enemies might pass through, or use pulse to hit Watcher. But pulse only hits adjacent (within 1 tile) - Watcher is at dist 2 so pulse won't reach. I need to place traps on likely movement paths. (3,2) is between me and the enemies. I'll move to (4,1) to get some distance and safety, then place a trap at (3,2) to block enemy approach. Wait - trap range is ≤2 tiles from current position. From (4,1), (3,2) is within range. But I'm adjacent to Watcher at dist 2 - not adjacent so trap isn't blocked by Denial. Actually Denial blocks trap when adjacent to enemy Vector - I'm a Vector but Watcher is Oracle. Denial blocks enemy abilities when they're adjacent to me. My trap should work. Move away first to survive, then trap a chokepoint.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → recalibrate(2,3) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at critical HP and 3 tiles away — within scan range. I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Foresight shows Lattice will move to (4,1) and place a trap at (3,2) — so I should avoid (3,2). I can scan Lattice (already know their prompt but scan also deals 1 damage which could finish them off at critical). Then recalibrate Doc to warn about the trap at (3,2). Stay at current position to maintain safe distance from Lattice's denial range.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Watcher is wounded at (2,2) at 4/6 HP and adjacent to me at (2,3). I cannot patch but I can overclock Watcher to give them 2 abilities next turn — useful for dealing with critical Lattice. Lattice is at critical HP at (4,1) and far away. Multiple trap warnings: (3,3), (2,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) — avoid those tiles. I'll overclock Watcher to help them finish off Lattice, then wait or hold position.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,0) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 HP is critical at 1/9. Enemies are out of range. Traps already placed at (4,3),(3,3),(2,1),(3,2) covering key approach tiles. Watcher at (2,2) moving E could step into (3,2) trap. Doc at (2,3) moving S could hit (2,1) or (3,3). I should move closer to threaten but stay safe. Move to (3,1) to stay near trap coverage zone and get closer. Then place a trap at (3,0) or (4,0) to extend denial zone. Actually (3,1) is a valid move tile - from there I can place trap at (2,1) area but that's already trapped. Let me move to (3,0) and trap (3,1) which is a likely path. Or move to (4,2) and trap (4,3) - already trapped. Best: move to (3,1), trap (2,1) - already trapped. Move to (3,0), trap (3,1) - that's a gap in coverage between existing traps.
