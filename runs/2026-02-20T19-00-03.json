Aegis is a healthy sentinel at dist=2 - in range but orders prioritize medics then damage dealers; sentinel is neither priority but it's the only in-range target. Ghost at (4,5) is dist=3 so out of range at current position. If I move to (4,4), Ghost would be at dist=1 (adjacent), but that's too close and precision_shot is blocked adjacent to enemy Vector - actually that rule is about Vector class, not general adjacency.

No — only 2 ability uses, not move+2 abilities. Wait: OVERCLOCKED gives 2 ability uses, so I can do ability+ability, or move+ability+ability? The rules say MOVE + ABILITY or just one. OVERCLOCKED gives 2 ability uses this turn. So I can move + 2 abilities? Or 2 abilities without moving?

Let me use precision_shot on Aegis (2dmg), then suppressing_fire targeting... suppressing_fire hits a 2-tile line from target. I'll precision_shot Aegis, then precision_shot Aegis again to finish if possible, or suppressing_fire. Aegis is healthy sentinel (likely 11-12HP), 2+2=4dmg won't kill.
