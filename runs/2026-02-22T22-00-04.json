But trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — I'm a Vector, and trap is blocked when I'm adjacent to an enemy Vector. Rampart is sentinel, Bolt is striker — neither is a Vector, so trap should work. Move to (3,2), then place trap at (4,2) to intercept the enemy Bolt, or at (3,3) to block Rampart's advance. Trap at (3,3) blocks Rampart's path south. Actually placing trap between enemies and my allies: allies are at (5,1) and (5,4). Enemy Bolt at (4,2) threatens (5,1) ally. Trap at (4,2) directly on enemy position — can I trap an occupied tile? Trap goes on empty tile. So trap at (4,1) or (4,3) as interception. Move to (3,2) first, then trap at (4,2)... if it's occupied I should pick (4,1) or (3,3). Rampart is at (3,3) so that's occupied too. Trap at (4,3) between the two enemies could catch movement.
