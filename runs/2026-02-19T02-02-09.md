## Squads
### Player
- **Weaver** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
### Opponent
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is in range at dist=4 (within my range-3 + High Ground passive gives range 4 since no adjacent enemies). I'm at (5,1), no adjacent enemies, so High Ground applies giving rng4. Prophet at (4,4) is dist=4 (|5-4|+|1-4|=1+3=4), exactly in range. I haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire first, then consider repositioning.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(4,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded at (4,4) with 6/8 HP and needs healing. I need to move toward Prophet to get adjacent. From (1,4) I can move up to 2 tiles. Prophet is at (4,4), dist=3, so I can't reach adjacency in one move. Best move is toward Prophet: go to (3,4) which puts me dist=1 from Prophet. Then I can't heal yet since I'm not adjacent after this move — wait, (3,4) to (4,4) is dist=1, meaning adjacent! So move to (3,4) and then patch Prophet at (4,4).
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is in scan range at dist=2. Scanning them is highest priority this turn. No need to move first — I'm already in position. Weaver and Lens are out of range and no Foresight data yet.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,1) ✓ → scan(2,5) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 6-7, need ≤4). I need to advance to bring them in range. Moving to (1,2) then (2,1) would still leave them out of range. Best move is toward the center — (0,3) gets me closer but still not in range. Let me move to max advance toward enemies: (2,1) is reachable in one move from (0,1) with mv2. From (2,1), closest enemy (Warden at (2,5)) would be dist=4, just in range. I'll move to (2,1) and then scan Warden.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are 5-6 tiles away. I should advance and place a trap on a likely approach path. Warden at (2,5) will likely move south toward me along the x=2 column. Moving to (2,2) puts me in good position and I can place a trap at (2,4) or nearby to intercept that approach. Move to (2,2) first, then place trap at (2,3) to catch advancing enemies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Round 1, pushing forward. Moving to (2,3) closes distance with Weaver and enemy cluster while staying out of denial range (need to avoid adjacent to Weaver at 2,2 — so (2,3) is safe at dist=1... wait, (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2), that triggers Weaver denial. Move to (1,4) instead to advance safely. From (1,4) I can shield_wall facing South toward the enemy cluster below.
  State: Weaver 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Lens 8/8, Warden 10/10, Prophet 8/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is the medic keeping enemies alive — scan her now to reveal her strategy. She's exactly at range 4 from my current position (3,4), so I can scan without moving. Warden is already scanned. Prophet is out of range. After scanning Lifeline, I can recalibrate Deadeye who is our main damage dealer and just landed at (5,3) — but Deadeye is not adjacent to me. Weaver is adjacent at (2,2). Better to scan Lifeline first, then consider moving. If I move to (3,2) I get closer to Prophet but still out of range (dist would be ~3 to Prophet at 4,4 — actually dist=|4-3|+|4-2|=1+2=3, in range). But trap at (2,3) blocks some paths. Valid moves include (3,2). From (3,2) Prophet would be at dist=3, in range. But I should scan Lifeline this turn since she's in range now. I'll scan Lifeline from current position, then move to (3,2) to set up Prophet scan next turn.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → scan(3,2) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is targeting me with precision_shot this turn — I need to move to avoid it. Foresight shows Deadeye moves to (5,3) then shoots (4,4), so I must vacate (4,4). Moving to (4,5) keeps me at distance and still in range of Lens at (3,2) dist=3. I'll scan Lens to reveal their prompt — valuable intel on the enemy oracle.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is at dist 3, in range for precision_shot. I'm at (5,3), no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive applies giving rng4. No need to move — fire precision_shot at Prophet for 2dmg to start eliminating the oracle.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(4,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded at (4,5) with 6/8 HP, 2 tiles away. I need to move adjacent to heal. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Prophet at (4,5) and keeps me away from Weaver (dist >1). Then use patch on Prophet.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Enemies are at Weaver(2,2), Lens(3,2), Deadeye(5,3) — all to the south/southeast. If I move forward to (2,3), I lose fortify but get closer. Better to stay put and use shield_wall facing S toward the enemy cluster, protecting allies Prophet(4,5) and Lifeline(4,4) from incoming fire. But shield_wall only protects adjacent allies and I'm not adjacent to them. I should push forward to (2,3) to close distance, then shield_wall facing S to cover against the enemy cluster. Moving breaks fortify but orders say push aggressively.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(2,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3) — my Denial passive already blocks some of their abilities. I can't use trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it would hit Warden from my current position. After pulsing, I should move away to break adjacency and set up a trap on a likely approach path for Prophet/Lifeline coming from (4,4)-(4,5).
  State: Weaver 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Lens 7/8, Warden 7/10, Prophet 8/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with full HP and no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive gives +1 range. All three enemies are in range. Lifeline (medic) at (4,4) is closest at dist=2 and should be priority to eliminate support. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg — enough to one-shot a medic if they have 2HP or chunk them hard. Actually orders say prioritize wounded enemies, but none are wounded. Lifeline is closest threat and a force multiplier as healer. Use precision_shot on Lifeline for 2dmg. Then I can hold position or reposition. Staying put keeps High Ground passive. I'll fire precision_shot at Lifeline first, then wait to maintain position.
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(4,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Deadeye and Lens are already scanned. Weaver is out of range at dist=6. Deadeye targeted me last turn with precision_shot. Lens scanned (3,4) and recalibrate is their pattern. I need to scan Weaver but dist=6 > 4, can't reach. No new targets to scan — both visible enemies already known. I should recalibrate Lifeline at (4,4) who is adjacent to me, boosting the medic. Then consider repositioning. Actually Lifeline is adjacent at (4,4) — recalibrate is range:adjacent only. This gives Lifeline an addendum to help allies survive. Deadeye has me in their sights and will shoot again. I could move to (3,5) to shift position and make Deadeye reposition, while keeping Lens at dist=4 in scan range if needed. But all enemies scanned except Weaver who is too far. Best play: recalibrate Lifeline to boost healing effectiveness, then move away from Deadeye's line of sight.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,5) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Prophet at (3,5) is in scan range (dist=3) and not yet scanned — top priority. Warden and Lifeline already scanned. Foresight shows Prophet tried to scan me last turn, so revealing their strategy is urgent. I'll scan Prophet first. Then recalibrate Deadeye (our striker, currently at (5,3)) to boost damage output. I'm already at (3,2) which gives scan range to Prophet at dist=3. No need to move — scan Prophet then recalibrate Deadeye. Deadeye is at (5,3), dist=2 from me, not adjacent so I can't recalibrate. Let me check: recalibrate is adjacent only. Deadeye is at (5,3), I'm at (3,2) — dist = |5-3|+|3-2| = 3, not adjacent. Weaver is at (1,2), dist=2, not adjacent either. No allies are adjacent. So second action: move toward Deadeye to get adjacent next turn, or just wait. I'll move to (4,2) to get closer to Deadeye for recalibrate next turn, and stay safe from Warden (at (2,3)). Scan Prophet first from current position.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say prioritize healing Prophet, but Prophet is at 8/8 FULL HP — do NOT heal full-HP allies. Warden is wounded at 7/10 and needs healing. I have 1 heal left. Warden is at (2,3), dist=3, not adjacent. I need to move closer to Warden to heal. Valid moves include (3,3) which gets me to dist=1 from Warden at (2,3) — adjacent! Move to (3,3) then patch Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in melee range. Weaver is at (1,2) dist=2 — moving adjacent would trigger denial and block abilities. Deadeye and Lens are clustered east at dist=3. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I can move east toward (3,2) to close on Deadeye/Lens cluster, then shield_wall facing E to protect against that eastern threat. But Weaver at (1,2) is a concern — moving to (3,2) puts me dist=2 from Weaver still (safe). Valid moves include (3,2). From (3,2) I'm closer to Deadeye(5,3) and Lens(4,2). Shield_wall E would protect allies from eastern fire. Lifeline is at (3,3) — adjacent to (3,2) — so shield_wall from (3,2) facing E would cover Lifeline from eastern threats.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is at distance 2, within my range. I can place a trap on a tile between us to threaten their advance, or use pulse if they close in. Warden is at (3,2), I'm at (1,2). Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Warden — that activates Denial and blocks some abilities. But at (2,2) I'd be adjacent and could pulse for 1dmg to Warden (and any other adjacent units). Alternatively, stay at (1,2) and place a trap at (2,2) to punish Warden advancing. Trap at (2,2) is within my range (≤2 tiles) and I'm not adjacent to Warden currently, so trap is not blocked. This denies the direct path. Then wait or move to better position.
  State: Weaver 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Lens 7/8, Warden 9/10, Prophet 8/8, Lifeline 4/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(3,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Warden is adjacent at (3,2) and wounded at 9/10 — minor wound. Orders say prioritize Prophet, but Prophet is at full HP (8/8) and not adjacent. I cannot reach Prophet in one move (dist=2, but valid moves include (3,4) which puts me dist=1 from Prophet at (3,5)). However, orders also say stay adjacent to most threatened ally. Deadeye is targeting Prophet. I should move toward Prophet to be adjacent for overclock support. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Prophet at (3,5). From (3,4) I can use overclock on Prophet to give them 2 abilities next turn — useful against Deadeye threat. I must avoid moving to (2,3) which would be adjacent to Weaver at (1,3). Valid move (3,4) is safe.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(5,3) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no scan needed this turn. Warden is adjacent at (3,2) which is dangerous (blocks scan next turn if I stay, though Warden is sentinel not vector so adjacency doesn't block scan). Priority: recalibrate Deadeye at (5,3) to boost our damage dealer. I need to be adjacent to Deadeye — they're at (5,3), I'm at (4,2). Moving to (5,3) isn't in my move list but (4,3) is adjacent to (5,3)? No, (4,3) to (5,3) is distance 1, yes adjacent. Move to (4,3) then recalibrate Deadeye at (5,3). Also need to avoid trap at (2,2). Warden is moving to (3,2) and shield_walling East — staying at (4,2) keeps me in Warden's attack range next turn. Moving to (4,3) gets me adjacent to Deadeye for recalibrate and slightly away from Warden.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(1,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 I have 2 ability uses this turn (overclocked). Deadeye and Lens are already scanned. Weaver is the only unscanned enemy and is at dist=4 (in scan range). Foresight shows Prophet is targeting my position with recalibrate then move, and Lens scanned me last turn. I should scan Weaver to reveal its prompt, then use my second ability to recalibrate an ally. Lifeline is adjacent at (3,4) and could benefit from a recalibrate. I'll stay at (3,5) to keep scan range on Weaver at dist=4.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → suppressing_fire(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Priority target is Lifeline medic at (3,4), distance 3 — within precision_shot range. I'm at (5,3) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive gives +1 range (not needed here but confirms no suppression). I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire precision_shot at Lifeline first. Then suppressing_fire targeting Warden at (3,2) to slow the sentinel rusher — hit Warden and potentially the tile behind.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 I have a trap at (2,2) already. Warden is at (3,2) dist=3, Lifeline at (3,4) dist=3, Prophet at (3,5) dist=4. I should advance to threaten enemies and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer while staying at medium range. From there I can place a trap at (3,3) which is a central chokepoint enemies would pass through to reach our backline at (4-5,3). (3,3) is within range 2 from (2,3). This covers the approach corridor.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 Suppressed so only 1 tile move. Enemies at dist 2 (Weaver, Lens) — none in attack range. Lifeline is wounded at (3,4) to my north. Enemy cluster is west/east at y=3. Moving to (4,2) pushes toward Lens and Deadeye while avoiding Weaver's denial zone. Then shield_wall facing W toward Weaver to protect Lifeline from that direction.
  State: Weaver 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Lens 7/8, Warden 8/10, Prophet 7/8, Lifeline 2/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(3,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is wounded at (3,4) and was targeted by Deadeye's precision_shot last turn. I should recalibrate Lifeline to help them survive. Lifeline is adjacent to me (3,4) is 1 tile south. I can recalibrate them first, then consider repositioning. Weaver is at (2,3) — 3 tiles away, safe. All enemies already scanned. Priority: recalibrate wounded Lifeline, then stay at safe range.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → suppressing_fire(4,2) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is wounded and top priority. I'm at (5,3), Lifeline is at (3,4) — dist=3, in range. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg, which should kill a wounded medic. No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive applies. Shoot Lifeline first, then suppressing_fire on Warden at (4,2) to slow their advance.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → recalibrate(5,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no scan value. Warden is adjacent at (4,2) pushing shield_wall toward (3,4). Prophet is at (4,5) recalibrating allies. My priority is recalibrate on Deadeye at (5,3) to boost our main damage dealer. I should move away from Warden (avoid adjacent sentinel pressing forward) and get adjacent to Deadeye to recalibrate. Move to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Deadeye at (5,3) and away from Warden. Then recalibrate Deadeye with a targeting addendum.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so only 1 move. Deadeye is at (5,3) dist=2, not adjacent so can't attack. Moving to (5,2) gets me closer to Deadeye and the enemy cluster. From (5,2), Deadeye at (5,3) would be adjacent (dist=1) — still not in melee range this turn but positions me to attack next turn. I should use shield_wall facing North to block damage from the enemy cluster at (5,3)/(5,4). This protects me and potentially Prophet behind me.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are dist=4, out of range. I have traps already at (2,2) and (3,3). I should advance to deny more paths and set up additional traps. Moving to (4,3) puts me closer to both enemies and lets me trap (4,4) or (4,2) to cover approach routes. Warden at (5,2) would likely come through (4,2) or (4,3), Prophet at (4,5) through (4,4) or (3,4). I'll move to (4,3) then trap (4,4) to block Prophet's approach path.
  State: Weaver 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Lens 7/8, Warden 7/10, Prophet 7/8 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 6 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): attack(5,2) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (5,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I can use basic attack on Warden for 1dmg, or move first to get range. Moving to (5,5) puts me 3 tiles from Warden — but that's far and loses attack this turn. Better: move to (4,4) — wait, that's a trap. Move to (5,5) is safe and gives distance for precision_shot next turn, but I lose damage now. Actually: I can attack Warden adjacent for 1dmg now, then move away to (5,5) to set up precision_shot next round. Or move first to (5,1) — dist from Warden becomes... (5,1) to (5,2) is 1 tile, still adjacent. Move to (4,2) — dist from Warden (5,2) is 1, still adjacent. Move to (5,5) — dist from Warden is 3, enables precision_shot. Move to (4,4) is a trap. Move to (3,3) is a trap. Move to (4,2) is adjacent to Warden still. Valid safe moves: (5,1),(5,5),(4,2). Best plan: attack Warden first (1dmg), then move to (5,5) to escape adjacency and set up precision_shot next turn.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Weaver will move to (4,3) and trap (4,4) — so (4,4) is a trap tile I must avoid. Deadeye is adjacent at (5,5) and already scanned. Lens is at (5,4) and already scanned. All three enemies already scanned. My ally Warden is wounded at (5,2). I should recalibrate Warden to buff them, but Warden is 3 tiles away — recalibrate only works adjacent. I need to move closer to Warden to recalibrate, but that brings me toward Weaver. Moving to (3,4) keeps distance from Weaver (who ends at (4,3), dist=1 from (3,4) — that would be adjacent, blocking scan). Moving to (3,5) puts me at dist 2 from Weaver's final pos (4,3), safe. From (3,5), Warden at (5,2) is dist=3, still out of recalibrate range. All enemies scanned already. Best action: move to (3,5) to escape Deadeye adjacency and avoid Weaver's trap at (4,4). Then wait or scan — but all visible enemies already scanned. Warden is wounded; I can't reach adjacent. I'll move to (3,5) and wait.
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(5,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no scan targets remain. Prophet is at (3,5), healthy, and last turn recalibrated then moved to (4,5). Warden is wounded at (5,2) and used shield_wall facing N. My orders say recalibrate on damage dealers. Deadeye is my striker and is healthy at (5,5). I can recalibrate Deadeye from my current position (5,4) since they're adjacent. After recalibrating, I should reposition — moving to (4,5) would put me closer to Prophet (enemy oracle) which is risky. Moving to (5,3) keeps me near Warden but Warden has shield_wall facing N so attacking from south does nothing. Moving to (4,5) is where Prophet moved to last turn — bad. (4,4) has a trap. Best: recalibrate Deadeye first, then move to (5,3) to maintain positioning away from Prophet. Wait — Warden at (5,2) used shield_wall facing N, so (5,3) puts me adjacent to Warden from north side, behind the shield. I should avoid (5,3) since Warden could attack. Stay at (5,4) or move to (4,5)/(3,4). Prophet moved to (4,5) last turn — avoid that. Move to (3,4) keeps distance but has no trap. Actually let me recalibrate Deadeye (adjacent at 5,5) then move to (3,4) to stay safe.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → pulse(5,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and adjacent (dist=2) — prime pulse target. Pulse hits all within 1 tile, so I need to be within 1 of Warden at (5,2). Moving to (5,3) puts me 1 tile away and in pulse range. That would deal 1dmg to wounded Warden, potentially finishing or severely weakening. I'm also blocking Warden's advance toward backline. Trap at (4,4) already placed. After pulse, I can place a trap to cover another approach path.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver at (5,3) and DENIAL is active, blocking abilities — so shield_wall is blocked, but basic attack still works. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction which is valuable. Weaver is right next to me and healthy. Orders say attack when possible. I'll attack Weaver first (basic attack works in DENIAL zone), then stay put to maintain Fortify bonus since moving would lose it. Staying at (5,2) keeps fortification and lets me hold this position.
  State: Weaver 5/6, Deadeye 4/4, Lens 7/8, Warden 5/10, Prophet 7/8 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 7 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no new scan targets. Warden is wounded at (5,2) and took an attack from Deadeye last turn. I should recalibrate Warden to help them, but Warden is at (5,2) and I'm at (3,5) — not adjacent. Lens is adjacent to me at (4,5) which is dangerous since scan gets blocked near enemy vectors, but Lens is an oracle not a vector. My orders say recalibrate on wounded allies. Warden is the wounded ally but not adjacent. I could move toward Warden — closest valid move toward (5,2) would be (4,4), then from (4,4) Warden at (5,2) is still dist 3, not adjacent. Can't reach Warden for recalibrate this turn. Deadeye is at (5,5) and healthy, targeting Warden with attacks. I could attack Lens at (4,5) since it's adjacent (1 dmg) but that's low impact. Best play: move to (4,4) to reposition, then wait — or stay and wait. Actually, Weaver is at (5,3) with denial blocking adjacent threats — Warden at (5,2) is adjacent to Weaver, that's bad. Recalibrate would help Warden but I can't reach. I'll move to (4,4) to get closer to Warden for next turn recalibrate, and use attack on Lens since it's currently adjacent.
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(5,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (4,4) — already scanned, prompt known. Warden is wounded at (5,2), dist 4 — already scanned too. Both priority targets are already known. My orders say to recalibrate the damage dealer (Deadeye) to boost effectiveness. Deadeye is at (5,5), adjacent to me. I should recalibrate Deadeye. But first, I need to be careful — Prophet is at (4,4), which is adjacent to me. Prophet's prompt says to avoid adjacent vectors, but I'm an oracle not a vector, so that warning is for Prophet about Weaver. However, Prophet being adjacent to me is dangerous since I could be attacked. Foresight shows Prophet moved to (3,5) last turn then waited — so Prophet is mobile. I should move away from Prophet while staying able to recalibrate Deadeye. If I move to (3,5), Deadeye at (5,5) would be dist 2 — not adjacent, can't recalibrate. If I stay at (4,5), Deadeye at (5,5) is adjacent — I can recalibrate. But Prophet is at (4,4), adjacent to me. My orders say stay behind allies and maintain range. I'll recalibrate Deadeye first (who is adjacent at (5,5)), then move to (3,5) to gain distance from Prophet. Recalibrate addendum: focus fire on wounded Warden to eliminate them quickly.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and at distance 3 — exactly in range for precision_shot. I'm at (5,5) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive gives +1 range (not needed here but no adjacency issue). precision_shot requires LoS and no adjacent enemy — clear. Take the shot to finish Warden, then wait or hold position.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (5,3) and has DENIAL active blocking my abilities — only basic attack works. I'm at 4HP with Fortify active (50% DR if I didn't move). Deadeye is at (5,5) threatening from above. Orders say attack when possible, push forward. I can attack Weaver now while fortified to deal damage without losing DR. If I move I lose Fortify. Best play: attack Weaver (adjacent, DENIAL only blocks non-basic abilities), then shield_wall — wait, shield_wall would be blocked by DENIAL. So attack + wait to keep Fortify.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(5,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (5,2) - wounded and right next to me. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Warden for 1 damage (potentially finishing them if wounded enough). Prophet is at (4,4) dist=2, not in pulse range. After pulse, I should move to (4,3) to get distance from Warden and potentially block Prophet's advance. Trap is blocked since Warden is adjacent. Pulse first, then move away.
  State: Weaver 4/6, Deadeye 4/4, Lens 6/8, Warden 3/10, Prophet 5/8 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 8 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden at (5,2) is wounded and 3 tiles away — exactly in precision_shot range. I'm at (5,5) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive applies (+1 range, though not needed here). No movement needed; I can fire from current position. Use precision_shot on Warden to finish them off. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver's DENIAL zone, so my scan ability is blocked. All three enemies are already scanned anyway. Foresight shows Prophet (me) attacked (4,5) last turn and moved to (4,4) — that's my current position, so this is consistent. Warden is critical at (5,2) and Deadeye is targeting them with precision_shot. I need to get away from Weaver's denial zone to restore my abilities, and recalibrate Warden to help them survive. If I move to (5,3), I'm adjacent to Warden at (5,2) and can recalibrate them. Distance from Weaver would be 1 tile (4,3 to 5,3 = 1), still adjacent — denial still active. Move to (4,2) puts me dist=1 from Weaver still. Move to (3,4) puts me at dist=2 from Weaver (4,3), breaking denial. From (3,4) I can recalibrate adjacent allies — Warden is at (5,2), dist=sqrt(4+4)=2.8, not adjacent. Best option: move to (4,5) to escape Weaver's adjacency (dist=2 from 4,3), then recalibrate — but no ally is adjacent from there. Actually, I should move to (5,3) which puts me adjacent to Warden and I can recalibrate. But (5,3) is still adjacent to Weaver at (4,3)? dist = 1, yes still adjacent. So denial still blocks. I'll move to (3,4) first to escape denial, but then Warden isn't adjacent. Warden is critical — I need to recalibrate them. Let me try: move to (5,3), which is adjacent to Warden at (5,2). Weaver is at (4,3), dist to (5,3) = sqrt(1+0)=1, still adjacent. Denial blocks recalibrate. No good options for recalibrate with denial active. Best play: move away from Weaver to (3,4) to clear denial, then wait or attack. Or move to (4,5) away from Weaver — dist from (4,3) to (4,5) = 2, not adjacent, denial broken! From (4,5) I could try recalibrate but Warden at (5,2) is dist=sqrt(1+9)=3.16, not adjacent. No adjacent allies from any escape position. Just escape denial zone and wait.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(5,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (4,5) — already scanned so no need to scan again. I'm an oracle with attack (adjacent only, 1dmg) and recalibrate (adjacent only). Deadeye is my main damage dealer at (5,5) and is healthy. Foresight shows Prophet attacked (4,5) last turn and is moving to (4,4) this turn. I should recalibrate Deadeye to boost them, but Deadeye is at (5,5) — not adjacent to me at (3,5). I need to move closer to Deadeye to recalibrate. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to where Prophet is moving — risky. Move to (4,5) after Prophet leaves, then recalibrate Deadeye at (5,5)? Distance from (4,5) to (5,5) is 1 — adjacent, so I can recalibrate. But Prophet moves to (4,4) this turn, so (4,5) should be free after. However, I need to watch trap at (3,3). Best: move to (4,4)... wait, Prophet moves there. Move to (4,5) instead — Prophet vacates it. From (4,5) I can recalibrate Deadeye at (5,5). But wait — enemy Prophet may still be at (4,5) when I act since I go before Prophet in order. Let me check order: Lens(*) acts before Prophet(✓ already acted). So I act now, Prophet already moved. Foresight shows Prophet's LAST turn actions. Current position is (4,5). I should move to (2,5) or stay safe. Actually recalibrate Deadeye: need to be adjacent to (5,5). Move to (4,5) risks being adjacent to where Prophet might be. Safer: stay, use recalibrate on... no ally is adjacent. Move to (4,4) is valid and gets me closer but risks proximity to Prophet at (4,5) still (dist=1, not adjacent to vector so scan not blocked). Actually I should recalibrate Deadeye — move to (4,5) first (Prophet should have moved away per foresight pattern), then recalibrate Deadeye at (5,5).
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical at dist=2, I can finish it with attack or pulse. Prophet is healthy at dist=2 to the north. I'm at 4HP, need to be careful. Pulse hits ALL within 1 tile - at (4,3) that would hit Warden at (5,2)? No, dist=2 so out of pulse range. I can attack Warden (adjacent only, dist=2 - not adjacent). Trap is best here - Warden is critical and moving toward backline. Place trap at (5,3) or (4,2) to intercept Warden's path. Warden at (5,2) moving W will hit (4,2) or N to (5,3). Place trap at (5,3) to block Warden's northern advance toward backline. Then move to maintain position. Actually, trap on (3,3) already exists. Place trap at (4,2) to cut off Warden moving west. I'm at (4,3), trap range ≤2 tiles, (4,2) is 1 tile away - valid. Then move west to (3,3)? No, trap already at (3,3). Move to (3,4) to stay at medium range from both enemies while denying area.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 At 2HP I'm fragile but fortified. Enemies are at dist 3-4, all out of melee range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (5,4) closes gap with Deadeye at (5,5) to adjacent — but I only have 2HP so trading blows is risky. However orders are explicit: push forward and attack when possible. Moving to (5,4) puts Deadeye adjacent for an attack. Shield_wall facing N would protect Prophet at (4,5) from the enemy cluster above.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 5/8 HP. Deadeye is adjacent at (5,5) and already scanned. Lens is at (4,4) also adjacent. I need to move away — valid moves are (2,5), (3,5), or (4,3). Moving to (2,5) gets distance from Deadeye and Lens. Warden is critical at (5,4) — I should recalibrate them if I can get adjacent, but I need to stay safe. Moving to (3,5) keeps me closer for potential recalibrate on Warden. Actually Warden is at (5,4) — not adjacent from any of my valid moves. Move to (2,5) to escape cluster, then wait since no targets in scan range from there that aren't already scanned, and Warden isn't reachable for recalibrate.
- **Deadeye** (striker): attack(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (5,4) and critical — but precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Must use basic attack to finish Warden. Attack Warden at (5,4) for 1dmg to eliminate the critical target. Then I'm adjacent so precision_shot is still blocked — but Warden should be dead. Prophet at (2,5) dist=3 is in range for precision_shot after Warden dies. Move away to clear adjacency then precision_shot Prophet, or just attack Warden now and wait. Best: attack Warden (finish critical), then precision_shot Prophet at dist=3 (not adjacent after Warden eliminated).
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → recalibrate(5,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Warden is critical and adjacent — but I'm an oracle with no ranged attack worth using, and attack does 1dmg adjacent. Weaver is at (3,4) — not adjacent to me. Prophet is wounded at (2,5). I should recalibrate Deadeye at (5,5) to boost their damage output. I can move to (5,3) to get adjacent to Deadeye at (5,5)? No — that's 2 tiles away diagonally, not adjacent. Deadeye is at (5,5), I'm at (4,4). Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Deadeye. But I need to avoid being adjacent to enemy vectors — Weaver is at (3,4), moving to (4,5) keeps me away. From (4,5) I'm adjacent to Deadeye at (5,5). But Warden at (5,4) would be adjacent to (4,5) too — dist=2, not adjacent. Let me recalibrate Deadeye to focus fire on Warden to finish them off. Move to (4,5) first, then recalibrate Deadeye at (5,5).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with Fortify active (50% damage reduction). Deadeye is adjacent at (5,5) — I can attack. Staying put preserves Fortify. Shield_wall facing N covers Prophet from the enemy cluster at (4,5) and (5,5). Attack Deadeye first, then shield_wall N to protect Prophet.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical at (5,4) range 2 — attack to finish them. Prophet is wounded at (2,5) range 2 — pulse would hit them but I'm not within 1 tile (dist=2), so attack Prophet instead. Both enemies in range from current position. Priority: kill Warden first (critical), then attack Prophet. I can attack Warden and then attack Prophet, but I only get one ability per turn. Attack Warden (critical, will likely die), then move toward Prophet or place trap. Actually: attack Warden to eliminate, then move to (2,4) to pressure Prophet and potentially deny abilities next turn.
