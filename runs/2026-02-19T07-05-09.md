## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
### Opponent
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders. Then move toward the enemy cluster. Weaver at (3,4) is the highest-value target (vector denial blocks my breach/cloak if adjacent). I'll advance toward center while cloaked. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer while staying out of Weaver's adjacent denial range.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic (Lifeline). However, Lifeline is at dist=6, out of my range-3 (or 4 with High Ground passive if no adjacent enemy). Weaver is the only enemy in range at dist=4. Orders say target medic if no one wounded, but Lifeline is unreachable this turn. I should move closer to bring Lifeline in range while staying safe. Moving to (4,1) gets me closer to Lifeline at (4,5) — dist would be 4, in range. But I need to check: (4,1) to (4,5) = 4 tiles, within range-3+1(high ground)=4. I'm not adjacent to any enemy at (4,1), so High Ground applies giving range 4. That puts Lifeline in range. Move to (4,1), then precision_shot Lifeline.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies nearby. All allies at full HP, no healing needed. Move toward frontliners to stay in support range. Weaver(vector) at (3,4) is closest ally — I should position adjacent to be ready to overclock next turn.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far. I should advance toward the center while staying safe. Bolt is at (4,1) and is a striker who can benefit from overclock, but I need to be adjacent to use it. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to the action while staying away from Weaver's denial range. No good overclock target this turn — just advance.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is 2 tiles away at (3,2) — within trap range. I can place a trap between Doc and my allies to deny movement. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Doc which would deny some abilities, but also blocks my own trap placement. Better to stay at (3,4) and drop a trap at (3,3) — the tile between me and Doc — creating a chokepoint. This denies Doc's path to allies and punishes any advance.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Enemies at dist=4, out of attack range. Allies Lifeline@(4,4) and Weaver@(2,4) need protection. Move to (5,3) to close distance toward Bolt@(4,1) and stay between allies and enemies. Then shield_wall south toward incoming threats, covering Lifeline to my west.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Shade 5/5, Doc 6/6, Bulwark 10/10, Weaver 6/6, Lifeline 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Weaver is at (2,4) facing W, and I can reach (3,4) which is behind Weaver — adjacent and valid for breach. However, Weaver is a Vector and would block my cloak/breach if I'm adjacent to them. Wait — the denial range says 'adjacent', so if I move TO (3,4) I'd be adjacent to Weaver at (2,4), which would block breach. So I can't breach Weaver from behind. Instead, I should reposition toward Lifeline (the enemy medic) at (4,4). I can move to (3,3) or (3,4) to get closer. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Weaver — risky. Let me move to (2,3) — wait, that's not in valid moves. Valid moves include (3,3) and (3,4). (3,3) keeps distance from Weaver (dist=2 from Weaver at (2,4)), and positions me closer to Lifeline. I'll move to (3,3) to advance toward Lifeline while staying out of Weaver's denial range.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so orders say target the enemy medic (Lifeline). Lifeline is at (4,4), distance 3 — in range for precision_shot. I'm at (4,1), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. I should stay at max range and not move closer. Fire precision_shot on Lifeline at (4,4).
- **Doc** (medic): patch(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded at (3,3) with 3/5 HP and is adjacent to me (dist=1, I'm at (3,2) and Shade is at (3,3)). I should move to be adjacent to Shade and then patch them. Actually, Shade is already adjacent — (3,3) is one tile north of me at (3,2). I can patch Shade immediately. Weaver is at (2,4), dist=3, so not adjacent — abilities are not blocked. Patch Shade first, then wait or reposition.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/6 HP which is concerning. Both allies are at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are 3 tiles away. I should position behind Bulwark at (5,3) for cover. Moving to (5,4) keeps me adjacent to Bulwark and safer. No healing needed, no enemies in range, so I'll wait after repositioning.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → trap(3,2) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Doc is at (3,2), dist=3, approaching from the south. I should move toward the center to intercept and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (3,3) puts me between Doc and my allies, and I can place a trap at (3,2) or nearby to catch Doc. From (3,3) I'll also be closer to denying Doc's abilities. Let me move to (3,3) and place a trap at (3,2) to catch Doc if they advance.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) W ✓
  💭 Lifeline is wounded at (5,4) directly north of me. Enemies Bolt and Doc are at dist 3, approaching from the west. I should move to (4,3) to position between allies and enemies, then use shield_wall facing west to protect against incoming threats. Moving to (4,3) puts me between the enemies and our position while maintaining frontline presence.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Shade 5/5, Doc 6/6, Bulwark 10/10, Weaver 6/6, Lifeline 3/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn, so I must act now. Lifeline is wounded and high-value — I can reach (4,4) which is behind her. Move to (4,4) then shadow_strike Lifeline at (5,4) while still cloaked. This eliminates the enemy healer without breaking cloak (shadow_strike preserves cloak).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is critical and in range at dist=4 (within my rng3+1 for High Ground if no adj enemy). Wait — my range is 3, dist=4 is out of range. Bulwark is healthy at dist=2, in range. Orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded, but Lifeline IS critical. Lifeline is at dist=4 which exceeds my range of 3. I cannot reach Lifeline without moving. If I move toward Lifeline, I risk getting closer to Bulwark at (4,3). I'm at (4,1), Bulwark is at (4,3) dist=2. I need to stay at max range and never go adjacent. Lifeline at (5,4) — if I move to (5,2), dist to Lifeline = 2 tiles (same x, y diff=2), within range 3. Dist to Bulwark from (5,2): |5-4|+|2-3|=2, still not adjacent. No adj enemies so High Ground passive applies giving rng=4. From (5,2): dist to Lifeline = |5-5|+|2-4|=2, in range. Use precision_shot on Lifeline (critical) to secure kill.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Both enemies are out of range. I should position safely — moving toward Bolt at (5,2) to be ready to overclock or heal next turn if needed, while staying away from Weaver at (2,4). Moving to (4,2) keeps me close to Bolt (dist=1) and behind Bulwark without getting adjacent to Weaver.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,3) with 50% damage reduction. Shade is adjacent at (4,4) and Doc is adjacent at (4,2). I should attack Shade (specter is high-priority threat) and use shield_wall to protect Weaver at (2,4) from northern threats. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at distance 2 — my Denial passive is already suppressing their cloak. I should place a trap on a tile between Shade and my position, or on a path they'd use to advance. Moving to (3,4) puts me closer to Shade, activating Denial more centrally, and I can drop a trap at (4,4) — wait, I can't trap occupied tiles. Better: move to (3,4) and trap (4,3) to threaten Shade's movement south toward Bulwark, or trap (3,5) to block northern approach. Actually, staying at (2,4) and trapping (3,4) puts a mine on their likely approach path. Shade is at (4,4) moving west toward us — trap (3,4) to catch them. Then I can wait or pulse if they close.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Shade 4/5, Doc 6/6, Bulwark 10/10, Weaver 6/6 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (4,3). I can move to (5,3) to get behind Bulwark (facing W, so east side is behind), then use breach to take control. This is a high-value play — breaching the sentinel removes a defensive anchor and makes them obey me. Move to (5,3) first, then breach Bulwark.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,1) ✓ → overclock(5,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded at 4/5 HP and needs healing, but is at distance 2 — not adjacent. I need to move closer to Shade to heal. From my position (4,2), Shade is at (5,3). Valid moves include (5,1) but not (5,3) directly. Moving to (4,1) or (3,2) doesn't help. Wait — Shade is at (5,3), I'm at (4,2), distance=2. I can't reach adjacency in one move of speed 2... Let me check: moving to (5,1) puts me at dist 2 from Shade. Moving to (4,4) — not in valid tiles. Actually (4,4) is NOT in valid moves. Bulwark is at (4,3) blocking. Valid tiles: [2,2],[3,1],[3,2],[3,3],[4,0],[4,1],[4,4],[5,1]. Wait, (4,4) IS listed. From (4,4), Shade at (5,3) is distance 2 — still not adjacent. Hmm. From (5,1), Shade at (5,3) is distance 2. None of my valid moves get me adjacent to Shade (5,3). Bulwark is at (4,3) — I could attack Bulwark as a fallback, or use overclock on Bolt at (5,2) who is adjacent from (5,1). Let me move to (5,1) — then Bolt at (5,2) is adjacent (dist=1), and I can overclock Bolt for an extra action. Bolt is a striker with full HP so healing isn't needed. Overclock gives Bolt 2 abilities next turn — great for a striker. I take 1 damage from overclock but I'm at full 6HP. This is the best play since I can't reach Shade.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I have OVERCLOCKED status giving me 2 ability uses. I'm at (5,2), Bulwark is at (4,3) dist=2, within precision_shot range (≤3). No adjacent enemies so precision_shot is not blocked. I'll fire precision_shot twice on Bulwark for 2+2=4 damage to eliminate them. I haven't moved so no damage penalty.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies are far (dist 5-7), no immediate threats. I have a trap at (3,4) already. Enemies are clustered around x=5, moving from east. I should advance east to cut off approach corridors while placing another trap. Moving to (3,4) would land on my own trap — avoid that. Move to (2,4) to advance toward center, then place a trap at (3,4)... wait, trap already there. Place trap at (2,3) instead to create a kill zone along the y=3 approach lane where Bolt@(5,2) and Shade@(5,3) might advance through.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(5,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Weaver at (1,4). Weaver is at (2,4). I need to move west/toward (1,4). Valid moves include (3,3) and (3,4). (3,4) is a trap, so avoid it. (3,3) moves me west and closer to Weaver's position. I'll move to (3,3). Shade is adjacent at (5,3) so I could attack before moving, but orders are to move toward Weaver. I'll attack Shade first since it's in range, then move west.
  State: Bolt 3/4, Shade 3/5, Doc 6/6, Bulwark 8/10, Weaver 6/6 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown so I can't use it this turn. Bulwark is 2 tiles away at (3,3) facing W — I'm behind them from (4,3). I can move to (4,3) to get adjacent and behind Bulwark, then use shadow_strike for 2 damage without breaking cloak. Wait — I'm not cloaked, so shadow_strike won't maintain cloak advantage, but it still deals 2 damage vs attack's 1. Let me move to (4,3) which is adjacent to and behind Bulwark, then shadow_strike for 2 damage.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at dist=3, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn, so full 2dmg applies. Weaver is out of range at dist=5. No enemies are wounded, so I target Bulwark (no medic in range). I'm at (5,2) with no adjacent enemies, so precision_shot is not blocked. Stay put and fire.
- **Doc** (medic): patch(5,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent at (5,2) with 3/4 HP — I can heal them from current position (5,1). Bolt is lower HP priority than Shade but Shade is dist=3, not adjacent. I'll heal Bolt first, then move toward Shade for next turn. Enemies are far, no Vector adjacency risk.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Weaver at (1,4). Current position (3,3), Weaver is at (2,4). I should move toward (1,4) area. Valid moves include (1,3) which moves me left and toward Weaver's direction. I can also attack Shade who is adjacent at (4,3) while fortified for bonus damage reduction. But orders say move toward Weaver. Let me move to (2,3) first then (1,3)... wait, mv2 means I can move up to 2 tiles. I should move to (1,3) to get closer to Weaver at (1,4). After moving I lose fortify, so attacking Shade first makes sense — attack Shade at (4,3) for 1 damage while fortified, then move to (2,3) to head toward Weaver.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(4,5) ✓
  💭 Enemies are approaching from the east. Shade is wounded at (4,3), dist=3. I'm at (2,4). There's already a trap at (3,4) which covers the direct approach path. I should move to (3,3) to get closer and place a trap at (4,3) or nearby to catch Shade — but wait, (3,4) already has a trap. Shade is at (4,3), so I can move toward (3,3) then place a trap at (4,3) to block Shade's approach. Moving to (3,3) would put me at dist=1-2 from Shade and enable trap placement at (4,3). But note: trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — I need to check if I'd be adjacent to Shade at (4,3) after moving to (3,3). Distance from (3,3) to (4,3) is 1 — that's adjacent, so trap would be blocked there. Instead, move to (3,5) to place a trap at (4,4) or (4,5) to control the flank. Or move to (3,3) and place trap at (3,2) or (4,3). Actually Shade at (4,3) means adjacency from (3,3) — trap blocked. Let me move to (3,5) instead — from there I can trap (4,5) or (4,4) to cut off flanking routes, or trap (3,4) area. Actually (3,4) already has a trap. Move to (3,5), then trap (4,5) to extend denial zone northward and cut off movement paths.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Shade 2/5, Doc 6/6, Bulwark 6/10, Weaver 6/6 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 2HP, Bulwark is wounded at (2,3) facing W. I can move to (3,3) which puts me directly behind Bulwark (adjacent), then use breach to take control of this wounded sentinel. Breach from behind while cloaked would be ideal but I'm not cloaked. Still, breach from behind on a wounded target is high value — controlling Bulwark next turn could let me use the sentinel against Weaver or just waste their action. Move to (3,3) first, then breach Bulwark.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded at 2/5 HP at (3,3), distance 2 from me at (4,2). I need to close the gap to heal. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Shade at (3,3). Then I can use my last patch on Shade. Weaver is at (3,5) distance 4 so no denial risk. Bulwark is wounded and distant. This is the priority play.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range at dist=4 (within my range 3+1 for high ground if no adjacent enemy). I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so High Ground passive applies giving range 4. Precision shot Bulwark to try to finish them off. No need to move — current position is optimal at max range.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to attack Weaver at (3,5), but Weaver is my ally — I will not attack an ally. Shade is adjacent at (3,3) and is an enemy. I am fortified (50% DR) and at half HP. Best action: attack Shade who is in range, then wait to keep fortify. Do not move (moving loses fortify).
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → pulse(2,4) ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded and 2 tiles away at (3,3). I'm at (3,5) facing N. Trap at (3,4) is already placed between us. Shade is within my attack range (dist=2, but attack is adjacent only — dist 2 means not adjacent). My pulse hits all within 1 tile. Shade at dist=2 is just outside pulse range. I should move closer to Shade to get pulse off on the wounded specter, or place a trap. (3,4) already has a trap. If I move to (3,4) I'd step on my own trap — avoid that. Valid moves include (4,4) or (2,4). Moving to (2,4) puts me dist=1 from Shade at (3,3), enabling pulse to hit Shade. That also puts me closer to ally Bulwark at (2,3). After moving to (2,4), pulse at (3,3) would hit Shade (dist=1). This could finish off wounded Shade. Let's do: move to (2,4), then pulse targeting Shade at (3,3).
  State: Bolt 4/4, Shade 3/5, Doc 6/6, Bulwark 4/10, Weaver 6/6 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,3), wounded, and I'm already behind them. Shadow_strike deals 2dmg while keeping cloak — perfect use here. I'll shadow_strike Bulwark first, then wait or reposition. No need to move first since I'm already in position.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range at dist=4. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Stay at (5,2) — no need to move. Fire precision_shot on Bulwark to finish them off.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Shade is wounded at (3,3) — adjacent to me at (3,2), dist=1. I can use overclock on Shade to give them 2 abilities next turn, which is valuable since they're a specter. Weaver is at (2,4), dist=3 from me — safe from denial. I'm already adjacent to Shade at (3,3). Use overclock on Shade, then wait or move to stay safe.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded and adjacent (dist=2) — pulse hits them from current position. Bulwark is critical at (2,3) which already has a trap. I need to protect Bulwark. Shade at (3,3) is in range 2 for pulse (range 1 tile AoE from me at (2,4) — wait, pulse hits within 1 tile, so I need to be adjacent to Shade). Shade is at dist=2, so pulse won't reach from here. I can move to (3,4) — but that tile has a trap! Move to (3,5) puts me at dist=2 from Shade still. I can place a trap at (4,4) to block enemy approach, or pulse if I get adjacent. Moving to (2,5) keeps distance. Best play: move toward Shade to get adjacent for pulse, but (3,4) has a trap. I could move to (3,5) then pulse down toward (3,3)? No, pulse is 1-tile AoE from my position. From (3,5), Shade at (3,3) is dist=2 — still not in pulse range. I can't get adjacent to Shade without stepping on trap at (3,4). Place trap at (4,4) to block Doc/Shade advance corridor, then pulse from current — but Shade isn't within 1 tile. Best: place trap at (4,4) to block the approach, then wait since I can't reach Shade safely.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say attack Weaver at (3,5), but Weaver is my ally at (2,4). I cannot and should not attack allies. Shade is an enemy at (3,3), adjacent and wounded — I can attack Shade instead. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, at 2HP. Moving would lose fortify. Best play: stay put, attack Shade who is in range.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Shade 1/5, Doc 6/6, Bulwark 2/10, Weaver 6/6 | Dead: Lifeline

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/5) but overclocked with 2 ability uses. Bulwark is adjacent at (2,3) and critical — shadow_strike kills it without breaking cloak (if cloaked). I'm not cloaked currently, so shadow_strike won't keep cloak, but it still deals 2dmg which should finish off a critical Bulwark. Use shadow_strike on Bulwark first to eliminate it. Then with second ability use, shadow_strike again — but only one enemy is in range. Actually, Weaver is at dist=2, out of range for shadow_strike (adjacent only). Best play: shadow_strike Bulwark to finish it (critical = very low HP, 2dmg should kill), then move away from Weaver to safety since I'm at 1HP.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical and in range at dist=4 (within my range 3... wait, rng3 means max 3 tiles, but dist=4). Let me reconsider. My range is 3, Bulwark is at dist=4. The recon says inRange:true for Bulwark — so precision_shot can reach dist=4? The recon data says inRange:true, so I'll trust that. Bulwark is critical, so precision_shot for 2dmg should finish them. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. Stay at (5,2) to avoid moving closer to enemies.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → overclock(4,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is at 1/5 HP and critically wounded — top priority. Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I need to move toward Shade to use overclock instead, giving them 2 actions to potentially reposition or act. Shade is at (4,3), I'm at (3,2). Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Shade (dist=1). Weaver is at (2,4), dist=3 from me now — moving to (4,2) keeps me at dist=3 from Weaver, safe from denial. From (4,2) I can overclock Shade at (4,3) which is adjacent.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 4-5, out of range. Traps already at (3,4), (2,3), (4,5), (4,4) forming a solid barrier. I'm at (2,4) facing S. Moving toward (3,3) gets me closer while staying behind trap line. Better: move to (3,3) then place a trap at (3,2) to extend the chokepoint southward toward enemy approach paths. Bolt is at (5,2) moving N, Doc at (4,2). They'll likely push through the middle. A trap at (3,2) or (2,2) would intercept their advance.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Doc 6/6, Weaver 6/6 | Dead: Shade, Bulwark, Lifeline

### Turn 9 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is at dist=3, exactly at my max range. I'm at full HP, no wounded enemies. Orders say to target enemy medic if no one is wounded, but only enemy visible is Weaver (vector). I'll use precision_shot on Weaver since they're the only target in range. I'm not adjacent to Weaver so precision_shot is not blocked. Staying at current position (5,2) keeps me at max range and avoids moving adjacent.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No heals remaining, Bolt is at full HP so no healing needed anyway. Weaver is 2 tiles away at (2,2). I should use overclock on Bolt to give them an extra action - Bolt is a striker adjacent to me at (5,2). I need to stay out of Weaver's adjacent range. Currently at (4,2), Weaver at (2,2), so I'm safe at distance 2. I can overclock Bolt from current position since Bolt is adjacent at (5,2), and I'm not adjacent to Weaver so overclock won't be blocked.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Doc is at (4,2), distance 2 — within attack range. I have a trap at (3,2) already. Doc is adjacent to that trap zone. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Doc (dist=1), enabling Denial to block their abilities, then I can pulse to hit both Doc and potentially Bolt if Bolt moves closer. Actually Bolt is at (5,2) dist=3 from me, too far for pulse. Best play: move to (3,2) to get adjacent to Doc (applying Denial), then attack Doc for 1 damage. This pressures the medic and denies their healing abilities.
  State: Bolt 3/4, Doc 5/6, Weaver 4/6 | Dead: Shade, Bulwark, Lifeline
