## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move north toward Ghost (the enemy specter, closest threat at dist 3). Cloaking first keeps me invisible while I advance. Target priority is Marksman (damage dealer) but Ghost is closer and blocking the path. Move to (2,3) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → cloak(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — priority is to cloak immediately per orders and tip. Enemies are 4-5 tiles away, out of range. I'll move south toward the enemy oracle (priority target as damage dealer) then cloak. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer while cloak will protect approach.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(3,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=5, just out of scan range (max 4). I need to move closer to bring them into range. Moving to (3,3) gets me within 2 of Bulwark at (3,5) — well within scan range. From (3,3), Marksman at (4,4) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, also in range. I'll move north to (3,3) then scan Bulwark to reveal their prompt.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Insight (oracle) is at distance 2, within precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector (Lattice is far away), so precision_shot is not blocked. Priority target is the oracle (medic/support). Fire first, then reposition to maintain distance.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,2) ✗ Position occupied → trap(3,2) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far north. I should advance and place a trap on a chokepoint between my position and the enemies. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to the center while staying safe. Then I'll place a trap at (3,3) or nearby to threaten the approach corridor — but (3,3) is occupied by Insight. I'll place a trap at (2,3) instead — wait, that's occupied by Shade. Let me place at (3,2) which is a good chokepoint on the path enemies would take moving south.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Insight is 2 tiles away at (3,3) - I need to close to adjacent to attack. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Insight. Then I can use shield_wall facing N to protect allies from the enemy cluster ahead.
  State: Shade 4/4, Insight 4/6, Lattice 9/9, Bulwark 7/8, Ghost 4/4, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. Insight is the priority target (oracle = damage dealer). I'm already behind Insight — tile (3,2) is directly behind them (they face N) and is reachable. Move to (3,2) to get adjacent and behind, then use breach to take control of Insight next turn. This uses my cloak window perfectly before it drops.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining. Ghost (enemy specter) is at (3,2) facing E, and I'm already behind them from (2,2). I can move to (2,2) which is adjacent and behind Ghost, then use breach to take control of them next turn. This eliminates a high-threat enemy specter. Alternatively shadow_strike would deal damage while keeping cloak, but breach is more powerful. Cloak expires this turn anyway, so breach now is optimal.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, wasting my turn. I'll move to (5,3) which is away from allies at (2,2) and (2,0) and toward the east edge.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight (oracle) is in range at distance 2 and is high priority. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2 damage. I'm at (5,5) and Insight is at (5,3) — no adjacent enemies blocking LoS. Fire precision_shot on Insight, then wait to maintain position and distance from other threats.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 No enemies in attack range. Shade and Insight are both at dist=3 to the south/southeast. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (3,3) closes distance toward both Shade@(2,2) and Insight@(5,3). Then shield_wall facing S to protect allies from the enemy cluster to the south.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,1) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,0) facing N with move 2. Ghost is at (3,2) dist=3, Bulwark at (3,3) dist=4. I should move toward the center to place traps on likely approach paths. Moving to (2,1) then placing a trap at (3,1) would block enemies advancing south. Ghost at (3,2) moving south would step on it. Let me move to (2,1) first to get closer, then place trap at (3,1) to intercept Ghost/Bulwark approach.
  State: Shade 4/4, Insight 2/6, Lattice 9/9, Bulwark 7/8, Ghost 4/4, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I have orders to move away from allies and toward map edge, wasting my turn. My allies are at (2,2) and (2,1), so moving east/south toward map edge fulfills this. Moving to (5,0) gets me to the south edge while moving away from allies. I'll move there and wait.
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Ghost (facing E, I'm at 2,2 which is to their west/behind). Breach is on cooldown, so I'll use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Ghost is the enemy specter - a priority target and adjacent threat. Shadow_strike deals 1 damage and keeps cloak active. After striking, I can reposition toward Marksman (the priority damage dealer per orders) or stay to pressure Ghost.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward Marksman at (5,5). I'm at (3,2), need to move northeast. Breach is on cooldown. Lattice is at (2,1) — I must not move adjacent to it. Valid moves show (4,3) and (4,4) are reachable and move me toward (5,5) without getting adjacent to Lattice. I'll move to (4,4) to close distance toward Marksman while staying clear of Lattice's denial range.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (Shade at dist 4, Insight at dist 5, Lattice at dist 7). I need to close distance to get Insight (wounded oracle) in range — priority target. Moving to (5,3) gets me closer to Insight at (5,0), reducing distance to 3, still out of range-2. Moving to (4,5) or (3,5) gets me closer to Shade. Best move: go to (5,3) to approach Insight along the same column, then wait — I can't reach firing range this turn.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at (3,3) heading south, likely moving toward center. There's already a trap at (3,1). I should move north to (2,3) to get closer to Bulwark and use denial aura, then place a trap at (3,2) to catch Bulwark as it advances south. This creates a trap corridor between (3,1) and (3,2).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice is adjacent at (2,3) and has DENIAL active blocking my abilities except basic attack. I should attack Lattice to remove the denial zone. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward aggressively and attack when possible. Attack Lattice first, then consider moving toward the enemy cluster.
  State: Shade 4/4, Insight 2/6, Lattice 8/9, Bulwark 7/8, Ghost 3/4, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward Marksman at (5,5). I'm at (4,4) and (5,5) is in my valid moves list. No enemies in range from current position. Shade is 2 tiles away but I'm moving away from that threat. Moving to (5,5) puts me adjacent to Marksman for coordination.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, wasting turn. I'm at (5,0) already near the south edge. Moving to (3,0) takes me away from allies at (2,3)/(2,4) and stays near the edge. Then wait.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer (Marksman) and use breach on sentinels. Bulwark is adjacent but I'm not behind it — behind tile is (3,3). Ghost and Marksman are both reachable via (5,4) which is behind both. Priority: breach Bulwark to neutralize sentinel, then move toward Marksman. But breach requires being BEHIND enemy. I need to move to (3,3) first to get behind Bulwark, then breach. After breach, Bulwark is under my control next turn. Alternatively, move to (5,4) to get behind Marksman for next turn breach or shadow_strike. Orders say breach sentinels — so move to (3,3) to get behind Bulwark, then breach.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is at distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Lattice is at dist 3, not adjacent, so no blocking. Orders say medics first but Insight is out of range at dist 5. Shade is a healthy specter at dist 2 — priority target. I'll shoot Shade with precision_shot, then stay put (no need to move, current position is good).
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → pulse(2,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at dist=2, within my denial aura range. I should stay close to deny its abilities. Traps at (3,1) and (3,2) already block southern approach. I can move to (3,2) to be adjacent to Bulwark at (3,4) - wait, that's dist=2 still. Let me place a trap at (4,3) to threaten Marksman's approach, or pulse Bulwark. Bulwark is at dist=2, pulse only hits within 1 tile. I'll move to (2,4) to get closer to Bulwark at (3,4) making it dist=1, then pulse to hit it for 1dmg and deny its abilities while adjacent.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, exposing myself. Allies are at (5,5) and (5,3), so I should move away from them — toward the west/north edge. Moving to (4,5) gets me toward the north edge but still near Ghost. Moving to (3,5) is north edge and away from the ally cluster. Then I can wait or use ability. Shade is adjacent at (3,3) — I could attack first before moving, but orders say to expose myself by moving. I'll move to (3,5) toward north edge, away from allies. Then wait.
  State: Shade 2/4, Insight 2/6, Lattice 8/9, Bulwark 6/8, Ghost 3/4, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,1) ✓ → scan(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,0) with only 2HP — critically low. All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-7). Traps at (3,1) and (3,2) block moving north. Shade is wounded at (3,3) and just breached (3,4) last turn. I should recalibrate Shade to help them, but Shade is at (3,3) which is distance 3 from me — not adjacent. I can't reach adjacent to Shade without hitting traps. Best move: reposition to get scan range on closer enemies or recalibrate an ally. Move to (2,1) to avoid traps, then wait — no allies adjacent to recalibrate, no enemies in scan range. Actually, move toward (4,1) to get closer to Marksman at (5,3) — dist would be 3, in scan range. From (4,1): dist to Marksman(5,3) = |5-4|+|3-1| = 1+2 = 3, in range! Scan Marksman.
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with no breach available. Priority target is Marksman (enemy damage dealer). Both Marksman and Ghost are reachable via (5,4) which is behind both. Move to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Marksman (behind them, facing S) and adjacent to Ghost. I can shadow_strike Marksman to stay hidden and deal damage. Move (3,3)→(5,4) is distance 3 (valid: |5-3|+|4-3|=3). Then shadow_strike Marksman at (5,3).
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(5,4) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (5,4) and wounded. Orders say move toward Marksman at (5,5) to eliminate enemy damage dealer — but I'm already at (5,5). Shade is the immediate threat, adjacent and wounded. I can move to (4,4) to get behind Shade, then breach for a powerful control move. Behind tile for Shade is (4,4) which is reachable and adjacent. Breach from behind would let me control Shade next turn. Alternatively, shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best play: move to (4,4) to get behind Shade, then breach to take control of the wounded enemy specter.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (5,4) — this blocks precision_shot (Vector denial rule doesn't apply here, Shade is a specter). Wait, the WARNING says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Shade is a specter, not a Vector, so precision_shot is fine. Shade is wounded and adjacent (dist=1), within range 2. I can use precision_shot for 2dmg if I haven't moved, or 1dmg if I moved. Orders say maintain distance, so I should move away first then shoot. But if I move first, precision_shot does 1dmg. If I shoot first (no move), precision_shot does 2dmg — that could finish a wounded Shade. Better to shoot first for full 2dmg, then move away. Valid moves include (5,2) which increases distance from Shade at (5,4). Shoot Shade first for 2dmg, then move to (5,2) to maintain distance from remaining threats.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward map edge, exposing myself. Current position (3,5) — allies are Ghost @(4,4) and Marksman @(5,2). Map edges are at x=0, x=5, y=0, y=5. I'm already at y=5 (top edge). Moving to (1,5) takes me away from allies toward the left edge, maximizing exposure and distance from Ghost at (4,4). That's 2 tiles west along the top edge — good separation from allies.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with Bulwark at (1,5) dist=2 and Ghost at (4,4) dist=2. Both are in range. Ghost is a specter - my Denial passive blocks their cloak ability while adjacent. I should maintain pressure on Bulwark with denial and place a trap on a chokepoint. Moving to (1,4) would put me adjacent to Bulwark at (1,5), enabling Denial to suppress their abilities. Then I can place a trap at (2,5) or (3,4) to block Ghost's approach path. Actually, staying at (2,4) keeps me between both enemies. Let me place a trap at (3,3) which is a chokepoint between Ghost and our allies, then pulse if I can cluster them. Better: move to (2,5) to get adjacent to Bulwark at (1,5) - this denies their abilities - then trap at (3,4) to block Ghost's path toward Insight.
  State: Insight 2/6, Lattice 8/9, Bulwark 6/8, Ghost 3/4, Marksman 3/5 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP, very vulnerable. Ghost at (4,4) is healthy and in scan range (dist=3) — prompt unknown, scan it. Marksman is already scanned. I should scan Ghost first, then move to safety. Moving to (3,3) puts me at dist=3 from Marksman and away from traps at (3,1)(3,2). Actually scan Ghost first then move away. Ghost is at dist=3, within scan range. After scanning, move to (5,3) to maintain distance from Marksman at (5,2) — wait that's adjacent. Move to (4,0) to get away from Marksman and traps. Marksman is wounded at (5,2), I should avoid being adjacent. Move to (4,0) puts me away from traps and enemies.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 2HP, cloaked. Breach is unavailable. Insight is at (4,0) wounded - priority target. Behind tile for Insight is (4,1) which is reachable. I can move to (4,1) to get adjacent and behind Insight, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. That's the best play - get behind Insight and shadow_strike for 1dmg. Need to avoid Lattice at (2,5) - moving toward (4,1) keeps me far enough away.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,0) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is critical and in range at dist=3. I'm stationary so precision_shot does full 2dmg — enough to finish a critical target. No adjacent enemies blocking the shot. Fire on Insight first, then wait.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, exposing myself. I'm at (1,5) adjacent to Lattice at (2,5) with DENIAL active. Valid moves include (0,5) which is the west edge — moves away from allies at (4,1) and (5,2) and toward the map edge. I'll move to (0,5) to comply with orders. I'm in DENIAL zone so abilities may be blocked, but I can still move. After moving to (0,5) I'll wait.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,5) ✓ → attack(0,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at dist=2, within attack range. My ally Insight is critical at (4,0). I need to deny Bulwark abilities and pressure them. I'm at (2,5), Bulwark at (0,5). I can move to (1,5) to get adjacent and apply Denial, then attack. Alternatively, I can place a trap at (3,4) to block enemy approach toward my ally. But Bulwark is the immediate threat at dist=2 - getting adjacent denies their abilities. Move to (1,5) to deny Bulwark, then attack for 1dmg.
  State: Insight 1/6, Lattice 8/9, Bulwark 5/8, Ghost 2/4, Marksman 3/5 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 7 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is at (4,0) critical HP, distance 1, and I'm already behind them. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. At 2HP I need to finish this without exposing myself. Use shadow_strike to eliminate the critical oracle.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Lattice is at distance 7, well out of my range-2 abilities. Ghost is wounded at (4,1) nearby. I should reposition to get closer to the action while maintaining distance from Lattice at (1,5). Moving toward (4,3) keeps me mobile and positions me better. No targets in range so I'll wait after moving.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(1,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (0,5). My Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. I can't trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector... wait, I'm a Vector, and Bulwark is a sentinel, so trap is only blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Bulwark is adjacent so pulse hits them for 1dmg. But first I should consider: I'm at (1,5) with Bulwark at (0,5) to my west. I can move to (2,5) to escape adjacency, then place a trap between enemy positions. Or pulse now for 1dmg to Bulwark. Marksman is wounded at (4,3), Ghost is wounded at (4,1) - my traps at (3,1),(3,2),(3,4) are already covering that corridor well. Priority: pulse Bulwark for chip damage (they're healthy, adjacent), then move to (2,5) to set up a trap at (3,5) to block the eastern approach, or stay and use denial. Actually, ability first then move: pulse Bulwark at (0,5) for 1dmg, then move to (2,5) to maintain positioning and set up future trap coverage.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(0,5) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (0,5) with 50% damage reduction. Lattice is 2 tiles away at (2,5) — I can't reach it this turn without losing fortify, and moving adjacent triggers denial. My allies are wounded and far south. Best play: hold position, maintain fortify, and use shield_wall facing East to protect against Lattice's attacks.
  State: Lattice 8/9, Bulwark 4/8, Ghost 2/4, Marksman 3/5 | Dead: Shade, Insight

### Turn 8 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 2HP, cloaked. Lattice is at (2,5), dist 6, out of range. Breach is unavailable. I need to close distance to get shadow_strike range on Lattice. Moving toward (2,5) - best approach is toward (3,3) then (2,4) area. I can move 3 tiles. From (4,1), moving to (3,3) gets me closer. Then shadow_strike won't reach yet. Let me move as close as possible: (2,2) is reachable and gets me to dist 4. Best move toward Lattice is (2,2) which is valid. Still won't be in range for shadow_strike (need adjacent). Next turn I can close to adjacent. Stay cloaked - shadow_strike doesn't break cloak.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (2,5), distance 4 - out of my range 2. No enemies in range from current position. I need to close distance to get Lattice in range. Moving to (3,4) puts me closer but still need to check range. Moving to (4,5) gets me to distance 3 still out of range. Best move: go to (3,4) to close gap. From (3,4), Lattice at (2,5) is distance 2 - that should be in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet this turn so precision_shot deals full 2 damage.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → pulse(3,5) ✓
  💭 Marksman is adjacent-ish at dist=2 and wounded - I can reach (3,5) to get adjacent and deny abilities, or pulse from current position. Bulwark is at (0,5) dist=2, also in range. Both Marksman and Bulwark are wounded. Pulse from current pos hits tiles within 1 tile - only adjacent units. Neither enemy is adjacent so pulse won't hit. Better to move to (3,5) to get adjacent to Marksman at (3,4), denying precision_shot, and then pulse to hit Marksman. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Marksman - then pulse hits Marksman for 1dmg. That's solid. Trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy - once I move to (3,5) I'll be adjacent to Marksman so can't trap. Do ability first: pulse from (2,5) - no adjacent enemies so no effect. Better plan: move to (3,5) first, then pulse Marksman at (3,4) for 1 damage. Marksman is wounded so this could finish or severely weaken.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,5) ✓ → shield_wall(2,5) E ✓
  💭 Marksman is critical at (3,4) and needs protection. Lattice is at (3,5) distance 3. I should advance toward the enemy while setting up shield_wall to protect Marksman. Moving to (2,5) closes distance to Lattice to 1 tile — but caution note says avoid moving adjacent to Lattice. Moving to (1,5) keeps distance 2 from Lattice. From (1,5) I can shield_wall facing E to protect allies from Lattice's direction.
  State: Lattice 7/9, Bulwark 4/8, Ghost 2/4, Marksman 1/5 | Dead: Shade, Insight

### Turn 9 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 2HP, cloaked. Lattice is at (3,5) facing E - the behind tile is (2,5) which I can reach. I can move to (2,5) to get adjacent and behind Lattice, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This is the priority target as the vector denies cloak/breach when adjacent, but I'm not cloaked right now - wait, I need to check: shadow_strike keeps cloak but doesn't require it. I have 2HP so I need to strike efficiently. Move to (2,5) puts me adjacent and behind Lattice for shadow_strike.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP and adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, which blocks my precision_shot. I need to escape the denial zone first. Moving to (4,4) gets me out of adjacency with Lattice at (3,5), giving me distance. Then I can use precision_shot on Lattice from range 2 — wait, after moving to (4,4) Lattice is at dist ~1.4, still adjacent diagonally. Move to (4,3) instead — dist from (4,3) to (3,5) is sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, out of adjacency. But valid moves show (4,3) is available. From (4,3), Lattice at (3,5) is dist 2.2 — just over range 2. Use suppressing_fire on Lattice to slow and damage, or basic attack. Actually from (4,4): Lattice at (3,5) is dist sqrt(1+1)=1.41, still adjacent — denial still active. Need to move farther. (5,4) gives dist from (5,4) to (3,5) = sqrt(4+1)=2.24, no longer adjacent. From (5,4), Lattice dist=2.24 — just out of range 2. Suppressing fire has range 2. (4,3): dist to (3,5)=sqrt(1+4)=2.24, also out of range. Best escape is (4,4) then reassess — wait, (4,4) to (3,5) is diagonal dist 1.41, still adjacent. I must escape adjacency. Move to (4,3) — not adjacent to Lattice. Then use basic attack won't reach. With 1HP I need to survive. Move away from Lattice to (4,3) to escape denial zone, then suppressing_fire on Lattice at (3,5) — but range is sqrt(1+4)=2.24 > 2, out of range. I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). Lattice at dist 2.24 from (4,3) — out of range. So after moving to (4,3), no ability reaches Lattice. Try (3,3): dist to (3,5)=2, in range, not adjacent (dist=2). From (3,3) precision_shot on Lattice — but I moved so only 1dmg. Still worth it to chip Lattice. Move to (3,3), then precision_shot Lattice at (3,5).
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (2,5) - wounded and very close. Pulse will hit Ghost (dist 1) and potentially Bulwark (dist 2 from me, dist 1 from Ghost). Actually pulse hits within 1 tile of me, so Ghost at dist 1 is on the edge. Bulwark at (1,5) is dist 2 from me - outside pulse range. Ghost is wounded so pulse could finish or cripple them. I should pulse first to damage Ghost, then consider moving. Marksman is critical at (3,3) - already have traps at (3,1) and (3,2) blocking that corridor. My denial passive blocks Ghost's cloak ability since Ghost is adjacent. Priority: pulse Ghost now, then reposition.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → shield_wall(2,5) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (1,5) with 4/8 HP. Ghost and Marksman are both critical. Lattice is 3 tiles away at (4,5). Orders say push forward aggressively. I can move to (3,5) to close distance to 1 tile from Lattice, then use shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Lattice's direction. Moving to (3,5) gets me adjacent to Lattice at (4,5), enabling an attack next turn. Shield_wall facing E from (3,5) would protect Ghost at (2,5) if they move up, but Ghost is behind me. Better to move forward to (3,5) and use shield_wall facing E to block damage from Lattice to any adjacent ally.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, cloaked, with no breach available. Lattice (vector) is at (4,5), 2 tiles away — I cannot move adjacent or abilities get blocked. Bulwark is at (3,5) wounded, Marksman at (3,3) critical. The only enemy is Lattice at (4,5) wounded. I need to shadow_strike Lattice but I'm not adjacent. I can move to (3,4) to get closer without being adjacent to Lattice (which is at 4,5 — distance from 3,4 would be diagonal, ~1.4, so adjacent). Actually (3,4) is adjacent to (4,5)? Distance = sqrt(1+1)=1.41, diagonals may count. Let me think: (4,4) would be directly adjacent to (4,5). (3,5) is adjacent to (4,5) but Bulwark is there. Valid moves include (3,4) and (4,4). From (4,4) I'd be adjacent to Lattice at (4,5) — I can shadow_strike (1dmg, keeps cloak). Lattice is wounded, so this might finish it. But wait — moving adjacent to a Vector blocks abilities. The caution says 'avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked.' So I cannot shadow_strike if adjacent to vector. I'm stuck — I can't get close enough to shadow_strike without being adjacent to the vector which blocks abilities. Best play: move to (3,4) to pressure, then wait or shadow_strike if possible. Actually from (3,4), Lattice is at (4,5) — distance is sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 tiles, which is diagonal adjacent. Shadow_strike requires adjacent. But vector denial blocks adjacent abilities. I cannot use shadow_strike on vector at all when adjacent. My only option is attack (breaks cloak) from adjacent, but at 1HP that's suicidal. Best move: reposition to (5,5) to flank from a different angle, wait for teammates to finish Lattice.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - extremely fragile. Lattice (vector) is wounded at (4,5), dist=3. I'm in range for precision_shot since dist=3 is within range 2? Wait - precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, but dist=3 means OUT of range. I need to get closer but can't go adjacent. I could move to (4,4) which would be dist=1 from Lattice at (4,5) - that's adjacent, blocked. Move to (3,4) would put me at dist=2 from (4,5) - that's okay, not adjacent. From (3,4) I can precision_shot Lattice at range 2. But I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2. Lattice is wounded, so 1dmg might finish them. Let me verify: (3,4) to (4,5) = |4-3|+|5-4| = 1+1 = 2, not adjacent (dist=2, not 1). That's valid for precision_shot range ≤2 and not adjacent. I'll move to (3,4) then fire.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) E ✓
  💭 Lattice is adjacent and wounded — attack to finish it off. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is fine. Basic attack works even inside denial zone. Then shield_wall facing East to protect the critically wounded allies behind me.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(4,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 3HP, adjacent to both Bulwark (wounded) at (3,5) and Ghost (critical) at (5,5). Ghost is critical - pulse will hit both adjacent enemies for 1dmg each. Ghost should die from pulse, and Bulwark takes more damage. My denial passive is already blocking their adjacent abilities. Pulse first to hit both, then move to (4,4) to get distance and potentially place a trap.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP adjacent to Lattice whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities. I must move away first to escape denial, then use precision_shot. Moving to (2,4) puts me at distance 2 from Lattice (4,4), escaping denial. From (2,4) I can then use precision_shot on Lattice who is wounded — at range 2 after moving, precision_shot deals 1dmg (moved penalty), but Lattice is wounded so this could finish them.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → pulse(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/9 HP - critically low. Both enemies are in range at dist=2. Marksman is critical (low HP) and Bulwark is wounded. I should try to finish Marksman with pulse (1dmg to all within 1 tile won't reach dist=2), or use attack. Actually pulse only hits within 1 tile so won't reach either enemy at dist=2. I can attack either enemy at range 2. Marksman is critical - finishing them is highest priority. I could move to (3,4) to get adjacent to both enemies and enable denial, then attack or pulse. Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist=1 from Marksman@(2,4) and dist=2 from Bulwark@(3,5). At (3,4) I'd be adjacent to Marksman enabling denial. Then pulse hits Marksman for 1dmg potentially finishing them. But I'm at 2HP - getting adjacent is risky. Alternatively, stay at range and attack Marksman to try to finish them. Attack range is adjacent only - so I need to move adjacent. Move to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Marksman, then pulse hits Marksman (and Bulwark if within 1 tile - Bulwark@(3,5) would be dist=1 from (3,4)). From (3,4): Marksman@(2,4) dist=1, Bulwark@(3,5) dist=1. Pulse hits BOTH! That could finish Marksman and damage Bulwark more.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice is adjacent at (3,4) and critical — I must attack to finish it. I'm in DENIAL zone so only basic attack/movement work. Attack Lattice directly. I have 2HP with fortify giving 50% reduction, so staying put is safer than moving. Attack first, then wait to keep fortify.
