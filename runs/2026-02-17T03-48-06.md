## Squads
### Player
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
### Opponent
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Seer** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Pulse** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: Cloak immediately to become invisible, then advance toward enemy lines. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to enemies while staying in center lane.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(2,5) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: cloak immediately as instructed. No enemies in range, so cloak first to become invisible for 3 turns, then move forward to close distance toward Longshot (the damage dealer).
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → overclock(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: All allies full HP. Veil is adjacent damage dealer. Move south to stay with Veil, then overclock Veil for double abilities next turn.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → move(2,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Warden is in scan range (dist 3). Scan it to reveal enemy strategy. Then move south to maintain distance from frontline.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Pulse is in range at distance 4. Move forward to get closer for precision_shot, then use precision_shot on Pulse to deal 1 damage (reduced to 1dmg since I moved this turn).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Round 1: Push forward to close distance with enemies. Move to (2,2) to advance while staying in formation. Then shield_wall facing North to protect allies from enemy fire.
  State: Warden 10/10, Wraith 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Veil 4/5, Seer 8/8, Pulse 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Overclocked with 2 abilities. Longshot is priority target at (3,2). Move behind to (3,1), shadow_strike for 2dmg (keeps cloak), then breach to turn them against Warden.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → breach(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Seer is at (2,4) facing S, and recon shows (2,5) is behind them and reachable in 1 move. I'll move behind Seer to (2,5), then use breach to turn them against their team. This removes their oracle abilities from the enemy and gives us control.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,5) ✓ → attack(2,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say focus fire on Pulse, but I don't see Pulse in enemy list - Pulse is listed as an ally at (3,4). The actual priority target should be Wraith (enemy specter at 2,5, dist=1) who is in scan range. I'll scan Wraith to reveal their prompt, then attack them since they're adjacent.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded (4/5 HP) but 3 tiles away. Need to move closer to heal. Wraith enemy is close (dist 2), but priority is reaching Veil. Move south toward Veil at (3,1). Can move to (3,3) or (3,2). (3,2) gets me adjacent to wounded Longshot enemy but also closer to Veil. Will move to (3,3) to stay safer, then next turn can reach Veil.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 Pulse is adjacent at (3,3), blocking precision_shot. Move away to (4,2) to create distance and enable precision_shot next turn. This maintains range to both enemies while escaping melee threat.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall N ✓
  💭 Move forward to (2,3) to close distance and position between enemies. Then shield_wall facing N to protect Wraith from Seer while threatening both enemies next turn.
  State: Warden 10/10, Wraith 4/5, Longshot 2/4, Veil 4/5, Seer 8/8, Pulse 4/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(2,4) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining) → wait ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Seer at (2,5) with them facing S at (2,4). I can breach them this turn since cooldown is done next turn. After breach, I'll control their next action—valuable for an oracle. Use breach now while positioned perfectly.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded and I'm already behind them. Move to (3,2) to get adjacent while staying behind, then shadow_strike to finish them off without breaking cloak.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say focus fire on Pulse at (3,3). Pulse is 2 tiles away (diagonal), outside my attack range (adjacent only) but within scan range (≤4). I should move adjacent to Pulse first, then attack. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Pulse at (3,3).
- **Pulse** (medic): patch(3,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded (4/5 HP) and adjacent at (3,2). Seer is full HP. Enemy Warden is adjacent at (2,3). I should heal Veil with patch since they need it, then move to stay between Veil and the Warden threat.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Pulse is wounded and adjacent at (2,2). Attack to eliminate, then shield_wall E to protect from Veil/Seer cluster.
  State: Warden 10/10, Wraith 4/5, Veil 5/5, Seer 8/8, Pulse 2/6 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 Seer at (3,4) is perfectly positioned for breach - I'm behind them (they face E), only 1 tile away at (2,4). Move adjacent, then breach to take control of their next turn.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,2) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is 2 tiles away facing N. I'm already behind them at (3,2). Moving to (2,2) puts me directly behind and adjacent for breach. This breaks their defensive posture and gives us control of the sentinel.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → scan(3,2) ✗ No enemy at target
  💭 Orders say scan Veil at (3,2). Wraith at (2,4) is adjacent, blocking scan per Oracle rules. Must move away from Wraith first, then scan Veil.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → patch(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP (wounded). Veil and Seer are both full HP. Warden is adjacent at (2,3). I should move away from Warden to avoid death, then heal myself since I'm the most wounded ally.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Orders are to move to (3,4) and shield_wall facing S to protect the oracle. Moving to (3,4) positions me between Wraith and the enemies, allowing me to block incoming attacks from the south.
  State: Warden 10/10, Wraith 4/5, Veil 5/5, Seer 8/8, Pulse 4/6 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is at (4,3) facing S. I can reach (4,4) which is behind them and adjacent. Move there, then shadow_strike to deal 2 damage while staying effective. Breach is unavailable.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Warden is 2 tiles away, I can reach (3,3) which is directly behind them (they face N). Use breach to flip them to my control next turn, breaking their defensive line.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✗ No enemy at target → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say scan Veil at (3,2), but foresight shows Veil's move to (2,2) failed and they breached (2,3). Veil is cloaked specter - must be at (2,3) now. Scan range is 4 tiles, distance from (4,3) to (2,3) is 2 - in range. Will scan (2,3) to reveal Veil's prompt and apply vulnerability debuff.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → patch(4,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded (6/8 HP) and needs healing. Move to (4,2) to be adjacent to Seer at (4,3), then use patch to heal.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Already at (3,4). Use shield_wall facing S to protect against enemies positioned south of my location.
  State: Warden 10/10, Wraith 4/5, Veil 5/5, Seer 8/8, Pulse 4/6 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): breach(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Warden at (3,4) facing N. I'm at (3,3) which is their south. Perfect breach position. Breach them to turn their defensive abilities against their own team.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer at (4,3) is adjacent and I'm already behind them (facing S). Shadow_strike deals 2dmg while keeping cloak intact. This is optimal - no movement needed, stays stealthy.
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded (6/8 HP) and currently adjacent at (4,3). Patch is unavailable (0/3 uses). I should use overclock on Seer to give them 2 abilities next turn since I can't heal. Need to stay adjacent to threatened ally.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say scan Veil at (3,2), but Veil is actually at (3,3). I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Wraith is adjacent at (4,4) - I should scan them since they're in range and I don't have their full intel yet. Then use recalibrate on adjacent ally Veil to boost their effectiveness.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) E ✓
  💭 Move to (4,5) to position adjacent to Wraith, then shield_wall facing E to block enemy specters from flanking our backline
  State: Warden 10/10, Wraith 4/5, Veil 5/5, Seer 5/8, Pulse 4/6 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Seer at (4,3) is adjacent and I'm already behind them (they face S, I'm at (4,4)). Shadow_strike for 2dmg while keeping cloak. Then move to (3,2) to get behind Veil for next turn.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,2) facing S - I'm directly behind them. Already cloaked. Use shadow_strike to deal 2dmg while maintaining cloak, then move to flank Warden or reposition.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith just shadow_struck me and I'm at 3/8 HP. Pulse overclocked me last turn. Wraith is wounded and adjacent at (3,2). I should move away from Wraith to avoid another shadow_strike, then recalibrate Veil to boost our main damage dealer since both enemies are already scanned.
- **Pulse** (medic): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Patch unavailable (0/3). Seer wounded but not adjacent (dist=2). Wraith adjacent and wounded (dist=1). Must attack Wraith to eliminate threat, then move toward Seer to provide support next turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✗ Can only move 2 tiles → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical at (3,2). Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent. Shield_wall facing E blocks Veil's line to our backline and protects Wraith from eastern threats.
  State: Warden 10/10, Wraith 1/5, Veil 5/5, Seer 3/8, Pulse 4/6 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,2) ✓
  💭 At 1HP, I'm critically wounded. Pulse (medic) is 2 tiles away and behind—perfect shadow_strike target (keeps cloak). Move to (4,2) behind Pulse, then shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical HP at (4,2) - move adjacent to finish with shadow_strike. Then I can shadow_strike Warden next turn.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → overclock(5,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded (3/8 HP) and adjacent at (5,3). I'm out of patch heals (0/3). Best option is overclock on Seer to give them 2 abilities next turn, but this requires being adjacent. I'm already adjacent. However, overclock costs me 1 HP and I only have 2 HP left. With no enemies in range and Warden far away, I should move closer to Seer and use overclock to maximize their damage output next turn.
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(5,4) ✓ → attack(4,5) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Overclocked with 2 abilities. Warden at (4,5) is scanned. Pulse (medic) wounded at (5,4). Use recalibrate on Pulse to boost effectiveness, then attack Warden from range 3.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) E ✓
  💭 Orders say move adjacent to Wraith and shield_wall east, but no Wraith exists—only Veil, Seer, Pulse. Pulse is closest (dist=2). Move to (4,4) adjacent to Pulse at (5,4), then shield_wall facing east to block their position and protect backline.
  State: Warden 10/10, Veil 5/5, Seer 2/8, Pulse 2/6 | Dead: Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 9 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 Warden at (4,4) is 3 tiles away. I can reach (4,3) in one move (dist=2 from current position), then shadow_strike from adjacent position to deal 2dmg while maintaining cloak. This keeps me hidden and damages their last standing unit.
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is at range 2, within scan range (4). Pulse is wounded and adjacent to Warden. I should attack Warden to help finish it off, but I can only attack adjacent targets. Moving to (4,3) or (5,4) would put me adjacent to Warden. However, (4,3) has Veil, and (5,4) has Pulse. I'll move to a safe position and recalibrate Veil to boost damage output.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(5,3) ✗ Position occupied → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is critically wounded (2/8 HP) and adjacent at (5,3). However, patch is unavailable (0/3 uses). Warden is adjacent at (4,4). Best option: move to (5,3) to stay adjacent to wounded Seer, then attack Warden from there.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall S ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent (Veil and Pulse). Orders say attack when possible. I'm fortified so staying put maintains 50% DR. Attack Pulse (wounded, easier kill) then shield_wall facing south to protect allies from Veil cluster.
  State: Warden 8/10, Veil 5/5, Seer 2/8, Pulse 1/6 | Dead: Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 10 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 Warden at (4,4) is adjacent and healthy. I'm cloaked. Move to (4,5) to get behind them, then shadow_strike to deal 2 damage while maintaining cloak.
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(4,3) ✗ No ally at target → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Warden at (4,4) is in scan range (dist 2). Veil failed shadow_strike last turn but will retry. I should recalibrate Veil to boost damage, then reposition away from Warden to avoid getting adjacent.
- **Pulse** (medic): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Seer is wounded at 2/8 HP and adjacent at (5,5). Patch is unavailable (0/3 uses). Warden is adjacent blocking me. I'll attack Warden to contribute damage, then move to (5,5) to stay adjacent to Seer for protection.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → attack(4,5) ✓
  💭 Two critical enemies adjacent (Veil at 4,5 and Pulse at 5,4). Orders say attack when possible. Fortified gives 50% damage reduction if I don't move. Stay put and attack Pulse first (medic is priority), then attack Veil.
  State: Warden 6/10, Veil 4/5, Seer 2/8 | Dead: Wraith, Longshot, Pulse

### Turn 11 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and adjacent. I'm already behind them (they face S, I'm at their N). Shadow_strike deals 2dmg while keeping cloak—finish them.
- **Seer** (oracle): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Warden at (4,4) is wounded and in range for attack. I'm at 2/8 HP - critically low. Foresight shows Warden will attack (4,5) then (5,4), but Veil is at (4,5). I should attack the wounded Warden to help finish it, then move to (5,4) to stay adjacent for continued pressure.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Seer is critical at (5,4), adjacent and in range. Attack to eliminate. Then move to (4,5) to pressure Veil.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓

- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Warden is adjacent and wounded (1 tile away). I'm at 1 HP and cannot survive another hit. Must move away to safety. Move to (5,5) creates distance from Warden. Then attack Warden from range to finish them off.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,5). Attack to eliminate the healthy target, then move forward to (4,5) to maintain pressure and prepare for next turn engagement with Seer.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (4,4), facing S. I'm at (4,5) already behind them. Shadow_strike deals 2dmg and keeps cloak. This should finish them.
- **Seer** (oracle): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → wait ✓
  💭 Warden at 2 tiles distance, wounded. Can attack to finish them off. Veil is wounded and adjacent to Warden - risky. Attack Warden to eliminate threat.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent and wounded. Attack to finish them off, then move forward to maintain pressure on Seer.
  State: Warden 3/10, Veil 2/5, Seer 1/8 | Dead: Wraith, Longshot, Pulse

### Turn 14 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and at range 2. Move to (4,4) which is behind them (they face E), then shadow_strike to finish them while staying cloaked.
- **Seer** (oracle): attack(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is critical (1HP) and adjacent. I can finish them with attack. This wins the game since Warden is the last enemy.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,5) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Critical HP (1/10), fortified. Two enemies in melee range, both wounded. Seer is critical - finish them first with attack. Then attack Veil if able.
