## Squads
### Player
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
### Opponent
- **Marksman** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are distant. Move toward Warden to position safely behind the sentinel and be ready to support next round.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,1) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Weaver(vector) is at (4,1), distance 3 — exactly in range for precision_shot. I'm currently at (4,4) with no adjacent enemies, so precision_shot is not blocked. I have not moved yet, so I get full 2dmg. Firing at Weaver is the priority — it's the nearest threat and in range. After shooting, I'll hold position or shift slightly. Moving would reduce precision_shot to 1dmg, so ability first.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(1,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1. Doc is closest at dist=3 and in scan range — highest priority to reveal their healing strategy. After scanning, I can move to maintain positioning. No enemy vectors adjacent, so scan is not blocked. Warden is also in range but Doc's heal abilities are more strategically valuable to know.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies are far. I should advance to hold the front line between my allies and the enemies. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to the enemy cluster while positioning between allies at (1,3) and (4,1) and enemies at (2,4), (1,4), (5,4). From (2,2) I'm closer to intercept threats coming down toward Insight at (1,3). No adjacent enemies to attack, so I'll wait after moving.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Bulwark and Insight are 2 tiles away to the south. I should advance to (2,3) to close the gap and potentially attack Bulwark next turn. Doc is at (1,4) behind me — I can shield_wall south to protect against Bulwark's advance. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (2,2), enabling an attack. After moving, I'll use shield_wall facing south to block incoming damage to Doc.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Enemies are at dist 4. Warden at (2,3) moving south, Marksman at (5,4) moving east. I should move toward the action and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (4,3) puts me closer and gives range2 trap coverage. Marksman at (5,4) might move to (5,3) or (4,4) — I can trap (5,2) or (4,2) as likely paths. Warden moving south might come through (3,2) or (2,2) but that's ally territory. I'll move to (4,3) then trap (5,3) which is directly in Marksman's likely southward path.
  State: Bulwark 10/10, Weaver 4/6, Insight 8/8, Warden 10/10, Marksman 4/4, Doc 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks scan per rules. Doc is adjacent too but already scanned. I need to move away from Warden to enable scanning. Moving to (0,3) puts me dist=2 from Warden, clearing the block. From (0,3) Warden is still in scan range (dist=2). Scan Warden to reveal their strategy.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Weaver is 2 tiles away at (4,3) — not adjacent, so precision_shot is not blocked. I can fire precision_shot at Weaver from current position (5,4) for 2 damage since I haven't moved. Weaver is in range (dist=2, within rng3). After shooting, I should move to (5,5) to gain elevation/distance and maintain high ground bonus away from threats.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Insight is at (0,3), dist=2 from me at (1,4). I should position safely. Warden sentinel is at (2,3) — I want to stay behind them. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Warden and keeps sentinel between me and enemies. No wounded allies to heal, no good overclock target adjacent. I'll reposition to (2,4) to stay near Warden and wait.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified (50% DR) and healthy. Orders say attack adjacent enemies and hold the line. Attack Warden first, then shield_wall north to protect against Doc at (2,4) who is just behind Warden.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with only 2HP — very low health. Warden is adjacent at dist=2 to my west. Doc is at (2,4) healing enemies. I need to stay alive and be useful. Orders say place traps on likely enemy movement paths. Marksman is at (5,5), could move south through (5,4) or (5,3) — but (5,3) already has a trap. I should place a trap on a high-traffic tile. Moving to (4,4) puts me further from Warden and I can trap (3,4) which is between Warden/Doc and my position. Or I can trap from current position. From (4,3), trap range is ≤2 tiles, so I can reach (2,3),(2,4),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,1),(4,2),(4,4),(4,5),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(6,3),(6,4) — but I'm not adjacent to enemy so trap is allowed. Warden at (2,3) is healthy — placing a trap at (3,3) could catch Warden if they advance east. Doc at (2,4) might move east toward (3,4). I'll trap (3,3) to catch Warden advancing, then move north to (4,5) to stay away from danger and near Marksman's southern approach.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark to deal damage, then use shield_wall facing South to protect Doc at (2,4) behind me from any threats. Moving would break Fortify, so stay put.
  State: Bulwark 9/10, Weaver 2/6, Insight 8/8, Warden 9/10, Marksman 4/4, Doc 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Doc** (medic): patch(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (2,3) adjacent to me at (2,4). I can heal them with patch. Bulwark is at (2,2) which is 2 tiles away — not adjacent to me, so abilities are not blocked. After healing, I'll wait or stay put since I'm already adjacent to Warden.
- **Marksman** (striker): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver (wounded vector) at (4,5), which means precision_shot is BLOCKED by denial zone. I can only use basic attack or move. Weaver is wounded — I should attack to try to finish them off, then move away to clear denial zone for future turns. Attack Weaver with basic attack (adjacent, 1dmg), then move to (5,3) to escape denial zone and get elevation/distance.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,2) ✓ → recalibrate(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden and Doc are already scanned. Marksman is out of range at dist=5. I should recalibrate Bulwark (our damage dealer at (2,2)) to boost effectiveness — but recalibrate requires adjacent range. I'm at (0,3), Bulwark is at (2,2), that's dist=3, not adjacent. Can't recalibrate from here. Next best: scan Doc or Warden already known. No new targets in range to scan. I should reposition to get adjacent to Bulwark for recalibrate next turn, or stay safe. Moving to (1,2) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (2,2) — dist=1, adjacent. Then I can recalibrate next round. But wait — I can move then recalibrate this turn if I end up adjacent. From (1,2), Bulwark at (2,2) is dist=1, adjacent. I can move to (1,2) then recalibrate Bulwark. Good plan.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with only 1HP — extremely vulnerable. All enemies are out of range. Marksman is at (5,3), likely to move toward center or up. I should move to (5,4) to get closer and place a trap on (5,3) or nearby to intercept Marksman. Actually, moving closer with 1HP is risky. Better to move to (3,4) and place a trap on (4,3) or (3,3) — but (3,3) already has a trap. Place trap at (4,3) to block Marksman's likely advance path.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) which I lose if I move. Attack Warden first to deal damage, then use shield_wall facing North to protect allies from Doc/Warden threats. Staying in place preserves Fortify.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified (50% DR) and didn't move last turn. Attack Bulwark to pressure them. If I stay in place, I keep fortify. But I should attack first, then shield_wall to protect Doc at (2,4) from Weaver threat to the south. Wait — shield_wall protects adjacent allies from a direction. Doc is at (2,4), one north of me. Weaver is at (3,4) — threat comes from East relative to Doc. I'll attack Bulwark, then shield_wall targeting Doc to the E to block Weaver.
  State: Bulwark 8/10, Weaver 1/6, Insight 8/8, Warden 9/10, Marksman 2/4, Doc 6/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver's denial zone, so abilities are blocked. I need to move away first to enable healing. Warden is adjacent at (2,3) and wounded at 9/10 — close but not critical. Marksman is critical at 2/4 but far (dist=4). Priority: escape denial zone, then heal Warden who I can reach. Moving to (1,4) puts me away from Weaver and still adjacent to Warden at (2,3)? No — from (1,4), Warden at (2,3) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, not adjacent (need dist=1). From (1,3), Warden at (2,3) is adjacent. Valid moves include (1,3). Move to (1,3) first, then patch Warden who will be adjacent.
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(2,2) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (1,3) — already scanned, prompt known. Marksman is out of scan range. Warden already scanned. Priority: recalibrate Bulwark or Weaver to boost damage output. Weaver is critical and a vector — risky. Bulwark is healthy at (2,2), adjacent to me, good target for recalibrate. I should move away from Doc (adjacent enemy medic isn't a vector so scan isn't blocked, but Doc is adjacent). My orders say recalibrate damage dealer — Bulwark is sentinel not a top damage dealer, but Weaver is critical. I can recalibrate Bulwark at (2,2) which is adjacent. Then I should consider moving to maintain range and avoid being adjacent to enemies. Doc is at (1,3) — not a vector so doesn't block scan. I'll recalibrate Bulwark to press the attack on Warden, then move to (0,2) to stay safe and out of melee range of Doc.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is critical at (3,4), dist=3, in range. I'm at (5,3) with no adjacent enemies, so precision_shot is available. Fire precision_shot at Weaver to finish them off. Then wait — no need to move, current position is safe and maintains distance from threats.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. If I stay put and attack, I keep fortify bonus. Attack Bulwark directly — it's adjacent. Then use shield_wall facing south to protect Doc behind me.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(0,2) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say attack Warden to break formation. I'm fortified (50% DR) and didn't move last turn — if I stay put and attack, I keep fortify active. Attack Warden, then use shield_wall facing North to block any incoming from Doc/Warden direction and protect Insight.
  State: Bulwark 7/10, Insight 8/8, Warden 9/10, Marksman 2/4, Doc 6/6 | Dead: Weaver

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,2) ✓ → recalibrate(2,2) ✓
  💭 Doc is at (1,3), dist=2, not yet fully exploited — already scanned. Marksman is out of scan range at dist=6. I should try to recalibrate Bulwark (my sentinel ally at (2,2)) to boost their effectiveness since they're taking hits from Warden. But recalibrate is adjacent-only and Bulwark is at (2,2) while I'm at (0,2) — dist=2, not adjacent. I could move to (1,2) to get adjacent to Bulwark, then recalibrate. That keeps me away from enemies and supports my ally. Warden's prompt is known: holds line, uses shield_wall, attacks adjacent. Doc heals lowest HP ally. I should move to (1,2) first, then recalibrate Bulwark with advice to press the attack on Warden.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is critical at 2/4 HP but is 4 tiles away — unreachable this turn. Warden is adjacent at (2,3) with 9/10 HP, only 1 wound. Insight is adjacent at (1,2) and blocks patch/overclock if I stay here. I need to move away from Insight first to enable abilities. Moving to (0,3) puts me 1 tile from Warden at (2,3) — dist=2, not adjacent. Moving to (0,4) keeps distance from enemies. Actually, Insight is at (1,2) and I'm at (1,3) — Insight is adjacent and blocks abilities. I must move to break adjacency with Insight before using patch. Move to (0,3): Insight at (1,2) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41 — still adjacent diagonally? Rules say adjacent = dist 1, so diagonal may not count. Actually grid distance: |0-1|+|3-2|=1+1=2, so (0,3) is dist 2 from Insight — not adjacent. From (0,3), Warden at (2,3) is dist 2 — not adjacent either. Move to (2,4): dist from Insight = |2-1|+|4-2|=3, safe. From (2,4), Warden at (2,3) is dist 1 — adjacent! I can patch Warden. This is the best move: go to (2,4), then patch Warden at (2,3).
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 2HP, enemies at Bulwark(2,2) dist=4 and Insight(1,2) dist=5. Bulwark is in range at dist=4 but my range is 3 (or 4 with High Ground passive if no adjacent enemy). No enemies adjacent, so High Ground applies giving rng=4. Bulwark is exactly at dist=4, so precision_shot should reach. I should fire precision_shot at Bulwark for 2dmg (killing it if healthy means it has more HP, but 2dmg is good). I haven't moved so no penalty. After shooting, I can move to maintain position or stay. Orders say prioritize killing wounded enemies but Bulwark is healthy. Still, precision_shot for 2dmg is best use. Stay put to keep High Ground bonus, then fire.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders are clear: attack Warden aggressively. I can attack first, then stay in place to keep fortify active for defense. No need to move — attacking without moving preserves Fortify.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) — attack it while fortified. If I stay put I keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark, then shield_wall south to protect Doc behind me.
  State: Bulwark 5/10, Insight 8/8, Warden 9/10, Marksman 2/4, Doc 6/6 | Dead: Weaver

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(2,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Warden and Doc already scanned. Marksman is out of range (dist=5). Doc is at (2,4), dist=3, in scan range but already known. I should recalibrate Bulwark at (2,2) to boost effectiveness — Bulwark is wounded and fighting Warden. Foresight shows Warden will attack (2,2) and shield_wall toward (2,4). Bulwark needs support. I can move to (1,3) to stay safe and recalibrate Bulwark. Wait — recalibrate is adjacent only. Bulwark is at (2,2), I'm at (1,2) — that's adjacent! I can recalibrate Bulwark now without moving. After recalibrate, I could move to (1,3) to maintain distance. Bulwark is our damage dealer fighting Warden, so boosting Bulwark makes sense. Recalibrate first, then move to (1,3) to reposition.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range at dist=4 (my max range with High Ground passive since no adjacent enemies). I can fire precision_shot for 2dmg to finish off the wounded Bulwark. I should not move first since moving reduces precision_shot to 1dmg. Stay at (5,3) and shoot Bulwark.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is exhausted (0/3). Marksman is critically low at 2/4 HP but dist=4, can't reach. Warden is adjacent at (2,3) wounded 9/10 — not critical. Bulwark is at dist=2 blocking south. I'm healthy at 6/6. Best play: overclock Warden at (2,3) to let them act twice and press the attack on Bulwark. Then reposition to stay safe behind Warden.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack Warden aggressively. If I attack first, I deal damage while still fortified. Then I can use shield_wall to protect Insight at (1,3) from the N direction threat. Actually, if I move I lose fortify. Better to stay, attack Warden, then shield_wall toward N to protect Insight from Warden's counterattack.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) and fortified (50% DR if I don't move). Both Bulwark and Insight are adjacent. Priority: attack wounded Bulwark to finish them, then attack Insight. Staying put keeps fortify active and I can use both ability charges on attacks.
  State: Bulwark 3/10, Insight 7/8, Warden 7/10, Marksman 2/4, Doc 6/6 | Dead: Weaver

### Turn 7 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range at dist=4. My range is 3 normally, but High Ground passive gives +1 range if no adjacent enemy, making it range 4. Both enemies are at dist=4, so I can hit them. Priority is killing the wounded Bulwark with precision_shot. I'm at (5,3) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground applies. I haven't moved, so precision_shot does full 2dmg — enough to finish Bulwark who is wounded. Stay in place, shoot Bulwark.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → scan(5,3) ✗ Out of range (max 4)
  💭 Warden is adjacent (2,3) — scan is BLOCKED by adjacent enemy vector. Marksman is at dist=4, in scan range but I'd need to move away from Warden first. My priority: escape Warden adjacency (scan blocked, and Warden will attack me again), then scan Marksman who is wounded and already in range. Moving to (0,3) puts me 2 tiles from Warden, unblocked. From (0,3) Marksman at (5,3) is dist=5 — out of range 4. Better: move to (1,4) — Warden dist=2, Marksman dist=4, still in scan range. Actually valid moves include (1,4). From (1,4): Warden@(2,3) dist=2 (not adjacent, scan unblocked), Marksman@(5,3) dist=4 (in range). Scan Marksman to reveal their full strategy. Bulwark is critical and needs help but I'm an oracle — recalibrate would help but Bulwark is at (2,2), adjacent only from (1,2) or (2,3) or (3,2). I can't reach adjacent to Bulwark this turn without being near Warden. Best play: move to (1,4) to break Warden adjacency, then scan Marksman (dist=4, in range).
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Marksman is critical at 2/4 HP but is dist=3, out of reach. Warden is wounded at 7/10, dist=2 — I can move adjacent and use overclock to give them 2 abilities. Moving to (3,3) gets me adjacent to Warden at (2,3). Overclock costs Warden 1 HP but doubles their actions, which is valuable with Bulwark nearby. Insight enemy is at (1,4) dist=2 — moving to (3,3) keeps me safer. Let me move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Warden, then overclock them.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) and critical — attack to finish them off. I have OVERCLOCKED so two ability uses. Attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall South to protect Doc and Marksman from Insight behind me. Staying put keeps FORTIFIED active.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,4) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 1HP but fortified (50% dmg reduction). Warden is adjacent at (2,3) — attack it to press the kill. If I move I lose Fortify, so stay and attack. Use shield_wall north to protect Insight at (1,4) from threats.
  State: Bulwark 1/10, Insight 7/8, Warden 5/10, Marksman 2/4, Doc 4/6 | Dead: Weaver

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical at (2,2) and needs help. Doc is healthy at (3,3) and already overclock'd Warden last turn — Doc's prompt says prioritize healing lowest HP ally, so Doc may heal Bulwark. Marksman is out of scan range (dist=5) and still unknown. I already know Warden and Doc's prompts. Priority: try to recalibrate Bulwark to boost their effectiveness, or scan Marksman if I can get close enough. Marksman is at (5,3), dist=5 — I'd need to move closer. From (3,4) dist to Marksman would be 3 — within range. Move to (3,4) then scan Marksman at (5,3). But wait — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Warden is at (2,3), from (3,4) dist to Warden = 2, not adjacent. Safe. Moving to (3,4): dist to Marksman = sqrt(4+1)=~2.2... no, Manhattan: |5-3|+|3-4|=3. Within scan range of 4. Execute: move to (3,4), scan Marksman at (5,3).
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is exhausted (0/3). Insight is adjacent at (3,4) — enemy oracle, healthy, blocking me from moving north. Warden at (2,3) is wounded 5/10 and adjacent to me. Marksman at (5,3) is critically low at 2/4 but I can't heal anyone. I should consider overclock on Warden to let the sentinel act twice — but overclock costs Warden 1HP (takes damage), bringing them to 4/10, which is risky but Warden has more HP buffer. Insight is blocking and adjacent — if I attack Insight I deal 1 damage to a healthy oracle. Better plan: move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Marksman — wait, dist to Marksman is 2 from current position and my moves don't include (5,3) or close enough. Valid moves include (4,3) and (4,4). Moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Insight. From (4,3) I could overclock Marksman at (5,3) if adjacent — dist from (4,3) to (5,3) is 1, yes! So: move to (4,3), then overclock Marksman so they get 2 actions next turn. Marksman at 2/4 losing 1HP goes to 1/4 — risky but double actions for a striker could be decisive. Actually overclock target takes 1dmg (the ally), so Marksman goes 1HP. Too risky. Instead: overclock Warden at (2,3) — but from (4,3) Warden is at distance 2, not adjacent. From current (3,3), Warden at (2,3) is dist=1, adjacent! So overclock Warden now, then move away from Insight. Overclock Warden: Warden takes 1dmg → 4/10, gets 2 abilities next turn. Then move to (4,3) to escape Insight's adjacency.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical at dist=4 which is out of my range-3 (unless High Ground applies, but dist=4 exceeds range 3+1=4... actually 4 tiles away, High Ground gives +1 rng so effective range=4, that's exactly in range). Insight is healthy at dist=3, in range. Priority is killing the critical Bulwark with precision_shot. I'm at (5,3), no adjacent enemies so High Ground passive applies giving range 4. Bulwark at dist=4 is just within range. I should shoot Bulwark first to finish them off. Then use suppressing_fire or precision_shot on Insight. Since I have 2HP I should stay safe. No movement needed — current position has both enemies in range and no adjacent threats.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Insight is at (3,4), distance 2 — not adjacent, can't attack. Allies Marksman and Doc are both at my east side, wounded. I should move to (3,3) to get between allies and Insight, positioning to intercept or attack next turn. With overclocked I have 2 ability uses — I can use shield_wall toward N (where Insight is threatening from above) to protect nearby wounded allies. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Insight's current tile and shields allies.
  State: Insight 5/8, Warden 4/10, Marksman 2/4, Doc 2/6 | Dead: Bulwark, Weaver

### Turn 9 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is at (3,4), distance 3, in range for precision_shot. I'm at (5,3) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive extends my range to 4 and precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Fire now, then consider repositioning.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Both allies are wounded but I can't heal. Warden is adjacent at (3,3), Marksman at (5,3). Overclock on Warden (sentinel) would let him act twice — good for defense/positioning. I'm at (4,3), Warden is at (3,3) which is adjacent. I can use overclock on Warden now. No enemies in melee range. Insight is at dist 2, not adjacent. I'll overclock Warden to give him double actions, then wait or move to stay safe.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 3HP, adjacent to Warden at (3,3) which blocks my scan ability. Foresight shows Marksman will precision_shot my position (3,4) again this round — I need to move away. All enemies are already scanned. I should move to safety and recalibrate an ally. Moving to (4,4) gets me away from Warden (no longer adjacent, so scan unblocked) and away from Marksman's last known shot target. Then I can recalibrate — but recalibrate is adjacent only. From (4,4) I'd be adjacent to... let me check: Warden is at (3,3), Doc at (4,3) — (4,4) is adjacent to Doc at (4,3)! I could recalibrate Doc, but Doc is an enemy. Wait — recalibrate is for allies. My allies are not listed with positions. Actually looking at the order list: Marksman, Doc, Warden are all enemies (E). My ally is just me (A=Ally). So no adjacent allies to recalibrate. Best move: get off (3,4) to avoid Marksman's precision_shot, move to (2,5) to increase distance from all threats, then wait since no adjacent allies to recalibrate and all enemies already scanned.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → attack(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 3HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Insight is at (2,5), distance 3 — not adjacent, can't attack. Allies Marksman at (5,3) and Doc at (4,3) are wounded. I should move north toward Insight to close distance and position between allies and enemy. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Insight at (2,5), but that's only reachable if I can move 2 tiles north: (3,4) then (3,5). Valid moves include (3,4) and (3,5). Moving to (3,5) closes to dist 1 from Insight. With overclocked I have 2 ability uses — I can't attack from current pos, but after moving to (3,5) Insight is adjacent. However, ability use is pre-declared. I'll move to (3,5) as first action, then use attack on Insight at (2,5) as second action — but Insight is at (2,5) and I'd be at (3,5), distance 1 diagonally... wait, is diagonal adjacent? Typically adjacent means NSEW only. Distance from (3,5) to (2,5) is 1 tile west — that IS adjacent. Attack!

- **Doc** (medic): overclock(5,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Marksman is adjacent at (5,3) and wounded at 2/4 HP. I can use overclock on Marksman to give them 2 abilities next turn — they're wounded but still active and could do significant damage with an extra action. Overclock costs me 1 HP (I'm at 2 HP, so I'll drop to 1 HP — risky but Marksman at critical could turn the fight). Alternatively I can move toward Warden. But Marksman is right here and overclock could be impactful. Let me overclock Marksman then move away from danger toward (3,3) to stay safer.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (2,5), dist=5, out of range (max range 3+1 high ground=4). No enemies in range currently. I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. I have OVERCLOCKED with 2 ability uses but nothing to shoot. I should move toward Insight to get in range. Moving to (4,5) would close distance to 3 tiles from Insight — but (4,5) isn't in my valid moves. Valid moves include (5,5) and (4,4). Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=sqrt(4+1)~2.2 from... wait, dist to (2,5) from (4,4) = sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, so dist=3 (Manhattan? or Chebyshev?). From (4,4): |4-2|+|4-5|=2+1=3. That's in range! Move to (4,4), then use precision_shot on Insight. At critical HP, Insight is likely 1HP — precision_shot does 2dmg (or 1dmg if I moved). Moving first means 1dmg, but Insight is critical so 1dmg should finish them. Then second ability use: another precision_shot if still valid.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critically vulnerable. Warden is adjacent at (3,5) and Foresight shows it will move to (3,5) and attack me. I must escape. Valid moves include (1,5), (1,4), (0,5) — moving west puts distance between me and Warden. Move to (0,5) to maximize distance. All enemies already scanned. I can't scan (blocked when adjacent to Warden). I could recalibrate an ally — but survival is priority. Move away first, then wait or recalibrate Doc/allies if safe.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,5) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,5) with 3HP. Insight is at (0,5) distance 3, critical. Marksman is critical at (4,4), Doc is wounded at (3,3). Moving west toward Insight would close distance but lose fortify bonus. Better to hold position and use shield_wall west to protect from Insight's attacks, keeping the 50% damage reduction. No enemies adjacent so no attack possible.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → overclock(4,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Marksman is at 1/4 HP and critically wounded - highest priority. They're at (4,4), dist=2 from me at (3,3). I can move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Marksman, then use overclock to give them 2 abilities next turn - this maximizes their output since they're a striker. Warden is at 3/10 HP but farther. The enemy Insight is at dist=5, not a threat this turn.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,5) with only 1HP — critically wounded. Both enemies already scanned so no scan priority targets remain. Foresight shows Marksman will precision_shot at (2,5) this round, so I must NOT move to (2,5) or (1,5) — those are danger zones. Warden is doing shield_wall facing W, so also threatening (2,5) area. Safest move is (0,3) or (0,4) to get out of Marksman's line of fire. Insight (my ally) moved to (0,5) last turn per foresight — that's my current position, so we may be co-located or adjacent. I should recalibrate on a damage dealer if adjacent, but Insight is an oracle not a damage dealer. Best play: move to (0,3) to dodge the precision_shot aimed at (2,5), then wait — I'm too fragile to risk anything else.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) W ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 3HP, fortified. Doc is wounded at (4,3). Insight is critical at (0,3), dist=5, out of range. My orders are to hold the front line and position between allies and enemies. I should move toward the enemy to intercept while staying between Doc and Insight. Moving to (3,3) closes distance and puts me between Doc at (4,3) and Insight at (0,3). However, moving breaks fortify and I'm low HP. Better to move to (3,4) to maintain presence while keeping some cover. Actually, moving toward (2,4) gets me closer to the front line between the enemy and Doc. Let me move to (3,3) to be directly adjacent to Doc and shield_wall westward to protect against Insight's approach.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. Both enemies are already scanned. Warden used shield_wall facing W (protecting Doc). Doc used overclock on (4,4). Warden is between me and Doc. I should wait in place — no useful scan targets remain (both already known), recalibrate requires adjacent ally but I'm alone in this area. Best to hold position and wait since moving closer risks adjacency to Warden.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Warden is wounded at (3,3) but I can't heal. Insight is critical but far away at distance 4. I should use overclock on Warden to give them an extra action — useful since they're a sentinel. Move adjacent to Warden first, then overclock them. Valid moves include (3,4) and (4,4) which would put me adjacent to Warden at (3,3). Moving to (3,4) puts me at distance 1 from Warden (adjacent), and keeps me away from Insight.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,3) W ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 2HP, fortified (50% DR if I don't move). Doc is at (3,4) to my north, wounded. Insight is at (0,3) to my west at dist=3. My orders are to hold the front line and use shield_wall toward incoming threats. If I stay still, I keep fortify. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked). I should shield_wall toward the west (W) to protect against Insight, and use my second ability use to shield_wall again or wait. With fortify active, staying put gives me 50% DR which is critical at 2HP. I'll shield_wall W to block Insight's attacks on me/Doc, then shield_wall W again with second use to maintain coverage.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critically vulnerable. Both enemies are already scanned. Warden is critical (scanned), Doc is wounded (scanned). Foresight shows Warden used shield_wall twice last turn facing W, Doc moved and used overclock on Warden. My priority is survival — stay at range, never go adjacent. I should recalibrate an ally if possible, but I have no damage dealers listed in order. My ally order is just me (oracle). I should wait or reposition to stay safe. Moving to (2,3) gets closer to enemies — bad at 1HP. Staying at (0,3) or moving away is safer. I'll wait to preserve position and stay out of danger. Both enemies are already scanned so scan isn't needed. No allies to recalibrate nearby. Best play: wait both actions to avoid exposure at 1HP.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Warden is at (3,3) with 2/10 HP, wounded and adjacent to me. I can use overclock on Warden to give them 2 abilities next turn — they're a sentinel which can make great use of extra actions. I take 1 damage but I'm already at 2HP so I'll drop to 1HP. The enemy Insight is at distance 4, not adjacent, so overclock is not blocked. I should stay near Warden for support.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 1HP — extremely fragile. Doc is at (3,4) wounded and needs protection. Insight is at (0,3) dist=3, approaching from the west. I should move west to intercept and position between Doc and Insight, then use shield_wall facing west to block incoming damage to Doc. With fortify active I have 50% damage reduction if I don't move — but at 1HP I need to shield Doc more than protect myself. Moving to (2,3) puts me between Insight and Doc, then shield_wall west covers Doc from Insight's direction.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Both enemies are already scanned so no scan needed. Warden is at (2,3) critical and moving toward us; Doc is wounded at (3,4) and used overclock last turn. I should stay alive and useful. Moving north to (0,5) increases distance from Warden. Then recalibrate isn't useful since I need an adjacent ally. I'll wait as second action to preserve position.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with no heals left. Warden is at (2,3) with 1HP, critically wounded. I can't patch (0 uses left). I should use overclock on Warden to give them extra actions — but overclock costs Warden 1HP, dropping them to 0, which would kill them. So overclock is off the table. Best play is to move toward Warden to support positioning, staying behind the sentinel. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Warden and still safe. No useful ability to use this turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,4) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with fortify active (50% dmg reduction). Doc is wounded at (2,4). Insight is at (0,5), dist 4. I need to stay fortified (don't move) to maximize survivability. Shield_wall toward N to protect Doc from Insight who is to the NW. No enemies adjacent so no attack possible. Best play: hold position, use shield_wall on Doc toward the threat direction.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no scan value. At 1HP I'm critical and must not move adjacent to enemies. Warden is at (2,3) dist 4, Doc at (2,4) dist 3. I can't attack (adjacent only). Best play: recalibrate an ally if adjacent, but I have no adjacent allies. I'll wait in place — moving closer risks getting killed, and I have no useful ability to use at range except scan (already done).
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Warden is at (2,3) with 1HP - critically wounded but I can't heal. I can use overclock on Warden to give them an extra action, but it costs them 1HP which would likely kill them at 1HP. That's too risky. I should position safely near Warden for protection and wait. Moving to (2,5) keeps distance from Insight at (0,5). Actually, let me move to (3,4) to stay near Warden but slightly safer. Overclock would kill Warden (1HP - 1dmg = 0HP), so I must not use it. Best option: reposition to stay protected and wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, fortified, with Doc wounded nearby at (3,4). Insight is at (0,5) distance 4 — out of my attack range. I should stay fortified to keep 50% damage reduction since I'm nearly dead. Moving would lose fortify. I'll wait to maintain fortify passive and shield_wall toward the northwest threat direction to protect Doc.

### Turn 16 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Warden is at (2,3) with 1HP, critically wounded, dist=2. I can't heal but can try overclock to give Warden extra actions. I need to move adjacent to Warden first. From (3,4), moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Warden at (2,3). Then I can overclock Warden — giving them 2 abilities next turn could be decisive. I take 1 dmg (going to 1HP) but Warden getting double actions is worth it. Insight is far away at dist=4, no immediate threat.
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Doc is at (2,4), already scanned. Foresight shows Doc moved to (3,4) last turn. I need to stay alive and useful. Doc is wounded and within scan range (dist 3). I already know Doc's prompt, so scanning again is wasteful. I should recalibrate my damage dealer if adjacent, but I'm at (0,5) and likely not adjacent to allies. Valid moves include (1,5) or (1,4) to reposition. With 1HP I must avoid getting adjacent to enemies. Best play: stay put or move safely and wait — I have no adjacent allies to recalibrate, and Doc is already scanned. Wait is safest to preserve my position.

### Turn 17 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is already scanned and wounded. Foresight shows Doc will overclock an ally next turn — likely boosting an enemy damage dealer. I should recalibrate my ally to counter this. Doc is at (2,4), distance 3, within scan range but already scanned. No new scan targets available. I'll wait in place and recalibrate — but recalibrate is adjacent only and my ally isn't adjacent. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. Best action: stay put and wait since Doc is already known and there are no new targets to scan and no adjacent allies to recalibrate.
- **Doc** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP critical health with no heals left. Only enemy is Insight at dist 3, not in range. I have no adjacent allies to overclock. Best move is to stay safe and wait — no useful ability to use, no allies adjacent.

### Turn 18 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 HP is critical at 1/8. Doc is already scanned and wounded. No enemy vectors adjacent so scan isn't blocked. I should wait since I have no valuable scan targets (Doc already known) and moving closer risks dying. Stay put to avoid exposure.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with no heals left. The enemy Insight is at (0,5) critical. I have no allies adjacent to overclock usefully. I should move away from danger and wait — moving toward safety at (3,4) keeps distance from the enemy oracle.
  State: Insight 1/8, Doc 2/6 | Dead: Bulwark, Weaver, Warden, Marksman

### Turn 19 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP with no heals left. Insight is at distance 4 and critical — likely dying or near death. I'm the only one left (Doc). No patch available, no adjacent allies to overclock. I should try to move closer to engage or just wait safely. Moving toward (2,5) keeps me positioned. Actually with only 2HP I should be cautious. Insight is critical and at dist 4 — I can't reach it this turn (mv2). Best to move toward it to close distance for next turn.
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 HP is critical at 1/8. Doc is wounded at (2,5), distance 2, within scan range of 4. I already have Doc's prompt. Foresight shows Doc will move to (3,4) next turn. I should stay put and scan Doc again isn't needed — already scanned. No allies adjacent to recalibrate. I'm at max range safety. Wait to conserve — but I should try to be useful. No enemy vectors visible so scan isn't blocked. I can't attack (Doc is distance 2, need adjacent). Best action: wait both actions since I have no valid targets to recalibrate (no adjacent allies) and Doc is already scanned.
  State: Insight 1/8, Doc 2/6 | Dead: Bulwark, Weaver, Warden, Marksman

### Turn 20 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (2/6) with no heals left. Insight is adjacent at dist=2 and threatening. I should retreat to safety — moving away from the enemy oracle. I'll move to (3,4) to create distance, then wait.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is at (3,4), dist 4, within scan range. Already scanned Doc so scanning again would be redundant. Foresight shows Doc will move to (2,5) next turn — that's adjacent to my current position (0,5) via movement. I have 1HP so I must avoid getting hit. Doc moving to (2,5) puts them at dist 2 from me. I should move away to safety. Moving to (0,3) keeps distance. No ally adjacent to recalibrate. Doc already scanned. Best action: move to safety, then wait.
