## Squads
### Player
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → overclock(2,0) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away. I should position behind Bulwark (our sentinel at 3,1) for protection, and use overclock on Deadeye (striker) to give them an extra action early - strikers benefit most from extra abilities. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Bulwark and safer. But overclock requires adjacent ally - Deadeye is at (2,0) dist=2, Bulwark is at (3,1) dist=2. I need to move adjacent first. Moving to (4,1) gets me adjacent to neither. Moving to (3,0) gets me adjacent to Deadeye at (2,0)? No, dist from (3,0) to (2,0) is 1 - adjacent! Then I can overclock Deadeye for extra striker action on turn 1.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1 - must cloak immediately per orders. All enemies are 5-6 tiles away, none in range. After cloaking, I should advance toward the enemy medic Doc or the closest targets. Moving to (1,2) gets me 3 tiles closer toward the enemy cluster while staying cloaked.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest enemy is Aegis at dist 5. Need to move closer to get in range (range 2). Moving to (2,2) gets me closer but still out of range. Best move is to (2,2) which is 2 tiles north, bringing me to dist 3 from Aegis - still out of range. Let me check: from (2,2), Aegis at (3,4) = |3-2|+|4-2| = 1+2 = 3, still out of range 2. No position within mv2 will bring any enemy in range (min dist after move = 3). I have overclocked with 2 ability uses but no targets in range. Move north to close distance, wait on abilities.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. All enemies are 4-5 tiles away. I need to advance to get Deadeye or Doc in range (range 2). Moving to (3,3) brings me closer while keeping allies nearby. From (3,3) Deadeye at (2,2) would be distance 2 - in range for precision_shot. Doc at (3,0) still too far. Priority target is Doc (medic), but Deadeye is closer. Move to (3,3) to get Deadeye in range next turn or attempt shot if reachable.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Both enemies are to the north. Bolt is at (3,3) dist=2, Aegis at (3,4) dist=3. I need to advance north to close distance. Moving to (3,2) gets me adjacent to Bolt next turn. Then use shield_wall facing N where both enemies are concentrated.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is 2 tiles away at (3,2). I should move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Bulwark, then attack. But Bolt is at (3,3), so I can't move there. Move to (4,3) to flank, or (2,3) to get closer. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to both Bulwark at (3,2) (dist=2, not adjacent) and Deadeye at (2,2) (adjacent). Better to move to (3,3)... but Bolt is there. Let me move to (4,3) to stay on front line between allies and enemies, then use shield_wall facing S to protect Bolt behind me. Actually enemies are coming from the south (low y). I'm at (3,4), enemies at y=0-2. I should move toward (3,3) but Bolt is there. Move to (2,3) gets me adjacent to Deadeye at (2,2). I can attack Deadeye if I move to (2,3). Fortify passive won't apply if I move. Moving to (2,3) and attacking Deadeye at (2,2) is aggressive but sound.
  State: Bulwark 8/8, Deadeye 3/4, Doc 16/16, Aegis 8/8, Bolt 4/4, Shade 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. Deadeye is at (2,2) facing N, and I'm already behind them. I can move to (2,1) which is directly behind Deadeye and adjacent — perfect for breach. Breach is ready and this would make Deadeye obey me next turn, neutralizing a key damage dealer. Move to (2,1) then breach Deadeye.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → overclock(3,2) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is wounded at 3/4 HP and needs healing. I need to get adjacent to Deadeye at (2,2). From (3,0) with mv3, I can reach (2,1) but that's where Shade (enemy specter) is, so I can't go there. I can reach (3,1) which is distance 1 from Deadeye at (2,2) — but patch requires adjacent (dist=1). From (3,1), Deadeye at (2,2) would be dist=2, not adjacent. Let me check: adjacent means dist=1 in Manhattan. (3,1) to (2,2) = |3-2|+|1-2| = 1+1 = 2, not adjacent. I need to be at (2,2) itself or (1,2) or (3,2) or (2,1) or (2,3) to be adjacent to Deadeye. From valid moves, (2,0) is reachable. From (2,0), Deadeye at (2,2) is dist=2, still not adjacent. I need to move closer. Valid moves include (1,1) — from (1,1) to (2,2) = 1+1 = 2, not adjacent either. None of my valid moves get me adjacent to Deadeye (dist=3 away, need dist=1). Best I can do is move toward Deadeye to close the gap. Move to (4,1) to stay safe from Shade at (2,1), or move toward Deadeye. Move to (4,2) gets me closer to Deadeye and Bulwark. From (4,2), Bulwark at (3,2) is adjacent — I could overclock Bulwark. Bulwark is at full HP so no heal needed. Moving to (4,2) lets me overclock Bulwark (sentinel gets 2 abilities next turn = extra shield/attack). That's good value. Shade is at (2,1) — staying at (4,2) keeps me at dist=3 from Shade, safe.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward my team's backline. Allies are at (3,2) and (4,2), so I want to move away from them. My backline would be lower y (south). Shade is at (2,1) adjacent south, so I can't go to (2,0) safely without being adjacent. Valid moves: (2,4) moves north away from backline, (1,2) moves west away from allies, (2,0) moves to backline but puts me next to Shade. Orders say toward own backline - I'm striker facing N, allies are to my east. Moving to (1,2) moves away from allies westward. But 'backline' for my team - need to think about team orientation. Enemies seem to be north of me (Aegis at 2,3, Bolt at 3,3), so my backline is south. Moving to (2,0) goes toward my backline but Shade is at (2,1) - I'd be adjacent. Try (1,1) - moves southwest, away from allies at (3,2)/(4,2) and toward south backline. Then fire precision_shot at Bolt from (1,1) - dist from (1,1) to (3,3) is sqrt(4+4)=2.8, out of range 2. Try suppressing_fire on Bolt at (3,3) - range 2 from (1,1) is too far. Move to (2,0) first then shoot - but Shade adjacent blocks precision_shot? Shade is specter not vector, so no block. Actually precision_shot blocked by adjacent enemy Vector only. Move to (2,0), then precision_shot Bolt at (3,3) - dist=sqrt(1+9)=3.16, out of range. Shoot Aegis at (2,3) from (2,0) - dist=3, out of range 2. Just move to (1,1) to satisfy orders and shoot Shade at (2,1) with precision_shot - dist from (1,1) to (2,1) is 1, in range, 2dmg since I moved.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Bulwark is a sentinel not a Vector, so I can still use it. However, orders say medics first. Doc is at (4,2) dist=2, in range. But Bulwark is adjacent which is a threat. I need to move first to get distance from Bulwark and maintain LoS on Doc. Move to (4,3) — that puts me dist=1 from Doc and dist=2 from Bulwark, no longer adjacent. Then precision_shot Doc (medic = high value target). From (4,3), Doc at (4,2) is dist=1, still in range ≤2. I won't have moved toward an enemy Vector so precision_shot should work.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Three enemies at dist=2: Aegis at (2,3) NW, Bolt at (4,3) NE, Shade at (2,1) SW. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Moving to (3,3) brings me adjacent to Aegis at (2,3) and closer to Bolt. From (3,3), Aegis is to the W and Bolt is to the NE. Shield_wall facing N covers enemies above. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked). Move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Aegis, then attack Aegis, then use second ability slot for shield_wall facing N toward Bolt.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with Bulwark adjacent at (3,3). I should attack Bulwark since it's in melee range. Staying put preserves fortify bonus (50% dmg reduction). Attack first, then shield_wall facing E to protect Bolt at (4,3) from Bulwark.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Deadeye 3/4, Doc 15/16, Aegis 7/8, Bolt 4/4, Shade 3/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,1) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is adjacent at (1,1) facing S. I can move to (1,2) to get behind Deadeye, then use shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked — wait, I'm not cloaked. Breach cooldown is 1 turn. Best option: move to (1,2) behind Deadeye, then shadow_strike — but I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't keep cloak advantage. Actually I'm not cloaked at all. shadow_strike does 1 damage and keeps cloak if I were cloaked, but just does 1 damage otherwise. Breach is on cooldown. So: move to (1,2) to get behind Deadeye, then shadow_strike for 1 damage. This weakens Deadeye and positions me well.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is critically low at 2/4 HP and is the priority heal target. I'm at (4,2), Deadeye is at (1,1) — dist=4, out of reach this turn. Bolt is adjacent at (4,3) — dangerous, I need to move away. Bulwark is at (3,3) at dist=2, wounded at 7/8. I should move toward Deadeye while staying safe. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer to Deadeye (dist=3) and away from Bolt. But patch range is adjacent only. I need to get to dist=1 from Deadeye. From (3,1), Deadeye at (1,1) is still dist=2. Best I can do this turn: move to (3,2) to get behind Bulwark area, or move toward Deadeye. Moving to (3,1) brings me closer. Next turn I could reach (2,1) then (1,1). For now, move to (3,1) to escape Bolt and approach Deadeye. No heal possible this turn — too far.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(0,0) ✓ → suppressing_fire(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,1) with 2HP, Shade is adjacent at (1,2) which blocks precision_shot. Orders say move toward own team's backline (away from allies). My allies are at (3,1) and (3,3), so backline is toward lower-left. I should move away from Shade and toward corner. Moving to (0,0) puts distance from Shade. Then I can use suppressing_fire on Shade at (1,2) from (0,0) - dist=2, within range. This deals 1dmg and slows Shade.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I need to move away first to get range on Doc (the medic, high priority target). Moving to (5,3) puts me at dist 2 from Bulwark and dist 3 from Doc. From (5,3) Doc is still at dist 3 which is out of range 2. Best move is (4,2) or (5,2) to open distance from Bulwark and potentially reach Doc. From (5,2): Doc@(3,1) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2 tiles — still out of range. From (4,2): Doc@(3,1) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, in range! Move to (4,2) first, then precision_shot Doc.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) W ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to my west at (2,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified (50% DR) which is valuable — I should not move. Attack Aegis, then use shield_wall facing west/south where enemies cluster (Aegis W, Bolt SW, Shade SW). Most enemies are to my west/south. Shield_wall W to block Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 5/8 HP, suppressed so movement is limited to 1. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) - I should attack it. Staying put preserves Fortify (50% damage reduction). Shade is wounded at (1,2) to my south-west - I can shield_wall toward E to block Bulwark's attacks on allies, or just attack Bulwark directly. Attacking Bulwark is the priority since it's adjacent and healthy. I'll attack first, then use shield_wall facing E to protect allies from Bulwark.
  State: Bulwark 6/8, Deadeye 2/4, Doc 14/16, Aegis 5/8, Bolt 4/4, Shade 2/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Suppressed so only 1 move. All enemies at dist 3, none in range. Deadeye is wounded at (0,0) facing S — behind tile is (0,1), which is 1 step away. Move to (0,2) to close on Deadeye, getting to dist 2. Can't reach adjacent this turn.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,0) ✓ → patch(0,0) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is critically low at 2/4 HP and is my priority heal target. Deadeye is at (0,0), dist=4 from me. I need to close the gap. Moving to (1,0) gets me to dist=2 from Deadeye. Bolt is at (4,2) dist=2 and healthy - not an immediate threat to me. I should move toward Deadeye to heal next turn. Best move is toward (1,0) or (2,0) to close distance. From (2,0) I'd be dist=2 from Deadeye at (0,0). Let me move to (2,0) - that's within my mv3. Then wait as I can't heal from dist=2 (patch requires adjacent). Actually I should move as close as possible - (1,1) puts me at dist=2, (1,0) puts me at dist=1 which is adjacent to Deadeye! Moving to (1,0) is adjacent to Deadeye at (0,0). I can then heal Deadeye this turn.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(0,2) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded and within range at (0,2), distance 2. I can fire precision_shot for 2dmg before moving. Then move to (2,0) to reposition away from allies toward backline. I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector so precision_shot is not blocked.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark (sentinel) is at dist=2 and in range. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers — but Doc is at dist=5 and Deadeye at dist=4, both out of range. Bulwark is the only target in range. I'm at full HP, not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is valid. Fire precision_shot on Bulwark for 2dmg. No need to move — staying at (4,2) keeps distance from enemies and maintains range.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 5/8 HP, fortified (50% damage reduction). Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3). Shade is critical and needs protection. I should attack Bulwark since it's adjacent, then use shield_wall toward the south to protect against Deadeye at (2,0). Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) W ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) which is good. I'll attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing West where Shade and other enemies are clustered.
  State: Bulwark 4/8, Deadeye 4/4, Doc 14/16, Aegis 4/8, Bolt 4/4, Shade 1/4

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,2) with 1HP — critically low. Doc is at (1,0) distance 3, no behind positions reachable. Deadeye at (2,0) distance 4, no behind positions reachable. Bulwark at (3,3) distance 4, behind tile (3,2) is reachable. But I'm at 1HP so I must avoid taking any hits. Best play: move toward Doc to pressure the medic. Moving to (1,1) closes distance to Doc at (1,0) — I'll be adjacent next turn for shadow_strike while cloaked (if I were cloaked, but I'm not). At 1HP I should move to get adjacent to Doc and shadow_strike to kill the healer, which is highest value. Move (0,2)→(0,1)→(1,1) — that's 2 steps, reaching (1,1) puts me adjacent to Doc at (1,0). Then shadow_strike Doc from (1,1) targeting (1,0).
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(2,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Shade (specter) is adjacent at (1,1) and critical - dangerous enemy nearby. My passive blocks patch/overclock when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not Vector, so abilities should work. However, Bulwark at (3,3) needs healing at 4/8 HP but is dist=5, out of reach. I need to move toward Bulwark to heal them. Shade is critical and adjacent - I should move away from Shade to avoid being attacked, and head toward Bulwark. Moving to (1,2) or (1,3) gets me closer to Bulwark. Moving to (1,3) puts me at dist=2 from Bulwark at (3,3) - wait, dist is manhattan: |3-1|+|3-3|=2, adjacent means dist=1. Let me move toward (2,2) to get dist=|3-2|+|3-2|=2, still not adjacent. Best move toward Bulwark within 3 movement: (3,1) puts me at dist=|3-3|+|3-1|=2. Or (2,2) dist=2. I need to be adjacent (dist=1) to heal. From (3,0): dist=|3-3|+|3-0|=3, not adjacent. I can move up to 3 tiles. From current (1,0) with mv3, I can reach (3,1) or (2,2) but not (3,3) which needs dist=|3-1|+|3-0|=4+... wait manhattan from (1,0) to (3,3) is 2+3=5. Can't reach in one move. Best I can do is move 3 tiles toward Bulwark. Move to (1,3) puts me at dist=|3-1|+|3-3|=2 from Bulwark - valid tile. Actually (2,2) is dist 1+1=2 from me and dist 1+1=2 from Bulwark. Let me just move toward Bulwark as far as possible - (1,3) gets me to dist=2, then next turn I can reach and heal. For second action, overclock on Deadeye at (2,0) who is at full HP and nearby - Deadeye is dist=1 from me currently. After moving to (1,3), Deadeye at (2,0) would be dist=|2-1|+|0-3|=4, too far. Better to overclock Deadeye first while adjacent, then move. Deadeye is at (2,0), I'm at (1,0), dist=1 - adjacent! Overclock Deadeye first (extra action next turn for striker), then move toward Bulwark.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(1,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Shade is at critical status at dist=2, priority target for a kill. I can use precision_shot twice. I haven't moved so no penalty. First shot at Shade (critical, dist=2) to secure the kill. Second shot at Aegis (wounded, dist=3) to pressure them. Stay at current position to avoid moving adjacent to enemies.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is a wounded sentinel at dist=2, in range. Orders say medics first, but Doc is out of range at dist=4. Deadeye is also out of range. Bulwark is the only target in range. I'm at full HP and not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. Fire precision_shot on Bulwark for 2dmg since I haven't moved yet. No need to move — staying at (4,2) keeps distance from enemies while Bulwark is already in range.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) to my west. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is good. Attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing west (toward Aegis) or east (toward Bolt at dist 2). Bolt is to my east at (4,2). Shield wall facing E to block Bolt's incoming fire since Aegis is already wounded and my allies are nearby.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 3/8 HP, fortified (50% damage reduction). Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) wounded — attack to finish or weaken. Doc is also adjacent at (1,3) — enemy medic, dangerous if it heals Bulwark. I should attack Bulwark first (wounded, easier to kill), then stay put to keep fortify active. Not moving preserves fortify.
  State: Bulwark 2/8, Deadeye 4/4, Doc 13/16, Aegis 3/8, Bolt 4/4 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 6 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critically low at 2/8 HP and needs healing urgently. I'm at (1,3) and Bulwark is at (3,3), distance 2 — not adjacent. I need to move closer first. Moving to (2,3) is blocked by Aegis. I can move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Bulwark at (3,3)? dist from (2,4) to (3,3) = 2, still not adjacent. Move to (3,4) — dist to Bulwark (3,3) = 1, adjacent! That tile is in my valid moves. From (3,4) I can heal Bulwark. But wait — patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Aegis is a sentinel, not Vector, so patch is not blocked. Move to (3,4) then patch Bulwark at (3,3).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is the highest priority target per orders — medics first. Doc is at (3,4), dist=3, which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 is outside range 2). Actually precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, and Doc is dist=3. Bulwark (sentinel) is at (3,3) dist=2, in range, but sentinel is lower priority than medic. I need to close distance to hit Doc. If I move to (4,3) or (3,4)... (4,3) would put me dist=2 from Doc at (3,4), enabling precision_shot. Let me check: from (4,3) to (3,4) = |4-3|+|3-4| = 1+1 = 2, in range. But moving then using precision_shot deals 1dmg (moved penalty). Alternatively, I'm currently adjacent-ish to Bulwark at dist=2, not adjacent (adjacent = 1 tile). I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot isn't blocked. I can move to (4,3) to get within range 2 of Doc, then precision_shot Doc for 1dmg (moved penalty). Or stay and shoot Bulwark for 2dmg with precision_shot. Orders say medics first. Moving to (4,3) puts me dist=1 from Bulwark though — that would make me adjacent, blocking precision_shot! Avoid that. Move to (5,3) instead: dist to Doc (3,4) = 2+1=3, still out of range. Move to (4,4): dist to Doc (3,4) = 1+0=1, in range, not adjacent to Bulwark (dist to Bulwark from (4,4) = 1+1=2). Precision_shot from (4,4) hits Doc for 1dmg (moved). That's the best play.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(2,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded and in range at dist=3. My current position (2,0) has Aegis at (2,3) which is exactly 3 tiles away - within precision_shot range of ≤2 tiles? Wait, range is ≤2 tiles. Dist=3 is out of range for precision_shot. I need to move closer. Moving to (2,1) puts Aegis at dist=2, within range. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so no Vector suppression issue. Move to (2,1) then fire precision_shot on Aegis for 2 damage to finish off the wounded target.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with Fortify active giving 50% damage reduction — staying put is critical. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3). I should attack Bulwark to deal damage, then stay fortified. Moving would break Fortify and leave me extremely vulnerable at 2HP. Attack Bulwark first, then wait to keep fortification.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) and critical — attack to finish them. I'm fortified so I should avoid moving to keep 50% damage reduction. Bolt is at (4,4), to my NE. After attacking Aegis, use shield_wall facing N/E to cover allies from Bolt's direction. Doc is at (3,4) to my north, so shield_wall N protects Doc from Bolt.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Deadeye 4/4, Doc 12/16, Aegis 1/8, Bolt 4/4 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 7 — player
- **Doc** (medic): patch(3,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent at (4,4) - enemy Vector blocks patch/overclock if adjacent, but Bolt is a striker not Vector, so abilities are NOT blocked. Bulwark at (3,3) is wounded (7/8) and adjacent to me - I should heal Bulwark with my last patch charge. But first I need to check: Bolt is at dist=1, which means adjacent. Is Bolt a Vector? No, Bolt is a striker. So patch is usable. Bulwark is at (3,3), currently adjacent (dist=1 from my position (3,4)). I can patch Bulwark immediately. Then move away from Bolt to safety - move to (2,4) or (2,5) to get distance from Bolt while staying near allies.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is critical and at distance 2 - perfect range for precision_shot (2dmg). I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. I haven't moved yet so I get full 2dmg. Shoot Aegis to secure the kill, then wait. No need to move - current position is at max range from Aegis.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is highest priority target at distance 2 — precision_shot for 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to any Vector, so precision_shot is available. No need to move first since Doc is already in range. After shooting Doc, I'll wait as moving isn't necessary.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (4,4), distance 2 to my northeast. I need to advance. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Bolt at (4,4). Then I can attack. Orders say advance and attack if adjacent.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → overclock(4,3) ✓
  💭 No heals remaining. All allies are at full HP anyway. Bolt is at dist=2, so not adjacent - can't attack or overclock from here. I should reposition to be adjacent to Bulwark to use overclock next turn, while staying away from Bolt. Moving to (3,4) puts me between Bolt and allies - too exposed. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Bulwark at (4,3) - adjacent next turn potential. Actually (3,4) is dist=1 from Bolt which is risky. Let me move to (3,3) to be adjacent to Bulwark and use overclock on them since sentinel can benefit from extra action.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is highest priority target at dist=2, in range for precision_shot. But Bulwark is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot (Vector adjacency rule doesn't apply here - that's Vector not Bulwark). Wait - the warning says precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Bulwark is a sentinel, not Vector, so precision_shot should still work. I can shoot Doc at (3,3) from current position. But if I move first to (5,4) or (5,3), I increase distance from Bulwark and can still shoot Doc. Let me move to (5,4) to get away from Bulwark's adjacency, then precision_shot Doc. From (5,4), Doc at (3,3) would be dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2 - out of range 2. Better to stay at (4,4) and shoot Doc first, then move away from Bulwark. Precision_shot Doc at (3,3) from (4,4) - dist=2, in range, no movement penalty if I shoot before moving. Then move to (5,4) to create distance.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (5,4), distance 6, out of range. No enemies in range from current position. Orders say stay at maximum range. I can move up to 2 tiles to get closer while staying at range 2. Best move tile toward Bolt while keeping distance safe: move to (3,2) puts me at dist ~2.8 from (5,4), still out of range 2. Move to (4,1) puts me at dist ~3.6. None of these get Bolt in range 2. Closest I can get is (4,1) or (3,2) but still dist>2. I should advance toward Bolt to get in range next turn, but not adjacent. Move to (3,2) to advance - dist to Bolt becomes sqrt(4+4)=2.83, still out of range. Max advance without overextending: move to (4,1) reduces dist to sqrt(1+9)=3.16. Move to (3,2) is better positioning. Since I can't reach firing range this turn, advance carefully.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (5,4), distance 2 from my position (4,3). I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) and am fortified. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. I should move to (5,3) to get adjacent to Bolt, then attack. With overclocked I get 2 abilities - I'll attack twice or use shield_wall + attack. Since Bolt is the only enemy visible and will be adjacent after moving to (5,3), I'll move there and attack. With 2 ability uses I can attack twice for 2 damage total.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(3,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, patch is unavailable anyway (0 uses left). Deadeye is adjacent at (3,2) and could benefit from overclock for extra actions against Bolt. I should move closer to Bulwark for safety while using overclock on Deadeye to maximize damage output.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (5,4), distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close distance. Moving to (5,2) gets me distance 2 from Bolt — exactly in range. I'm overclocked so I get 2 ability uses. After moving to (5,2), Bolt at (5,4) is 2 tiles away, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet when I shoot... wait, I need to move first then shoot, so precision_shot will deal 1dmg (moved penalty). Actually I can shoot first then move: shoot from (3,2) — Bolt is distance 4, out of range. So I must move first. Move to (5,2), then precision_shot Bolt at (5,4) for 1dmg (moved penalty). Then use second ability: suppressing_fire on Bolt to slow it. Bolt is wounded, priority target.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Bulwark is adjacent at (5,3), which blocks precision_shot (adjacent enemy Vector rule doesn't apply here, Bulwark is sentinel). But being at 1HP means I need to prioritize survival. My orders say medics first. Doc is at (4,3) dist=2, in range. But I'm adjacent to Bulwark, so I need to check if precision_shot is blocked — the warning says blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not sentinel. So I can use precision_shot. Priority: shoot Doc (medic, high value) then move away. Moving to (3,4) or (4,5) increases distance from enemies. If I shoot first then move, I can hit Doc and escape. Doc is at (4,3), dist=2, in range. Use precision_shot on Doc first, then move to (3,4) to increase distance from the cluster.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) W ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (3,4), distance 3 to the west. I need to advance toward the enemy. Doc is wounded at (4,3) and needs protection. Moving to (4,4) advances me toward Bolt while staying near Doc. From (4,4) I can use shield_wall facing West (toward Bolt) to protect Doc from incoming fire.
