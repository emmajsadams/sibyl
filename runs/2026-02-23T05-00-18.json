Moving to (3,3) puts me at distance ~1.4 from Aegis at (2,3) — too close, could get adjacent issues. Moving to (3,4) gives dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still adjacent range. Moving to (4,3) gives dist=sqrt(4+0)=2 from (2,3), that's exactly 2 tiles. That works for precision_shot and keeps distance. Aegis is wounded so priority is to finish it. Move to (4,3) then precision_shot Aegis.",
