## Squads
### Player
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(3,0) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then advance toward Warden (closest enemy at dist 5). Move to (3,3) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is at dist=4 which is exactly in scan range, but I need to move closer first since 'inRange' shows false for current position. Wait - the pre-computed data shows Warden at dist=4 but 'inRange':false. The scan range is ≤4, so dist=4 should be in range. However the inRange field says false. I'll move north to (3,2) to get closer to Warden at (2,4) reducing distance to 3, then scan Warden. Ghost is my damage dealer at (3,3) - I should recalibrate them too. Priority: move north to close gap with Warden, then scan Warden.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → patch(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1. Warden is wounded (7/8 HP) but not adjacent - dist=2. I need to close distance to heal. Moving to (2,4) would put me adjacent to Warden at (2,4)... wait, Warden is at (2,4) so I need to be adjacent. Moving to (1,3) or (2,3) or (3,4) would be adjacent. Let me move toward Warden. (2,3) is in my valid moves and adjacent to Warden at (2,4). Actually wait - I'm at (1,5), Warden is at (2,4). Distance is 2. If I move to (2,5) that's dist 1 from Warden. Or (1,4) - not in valid moves list... (2,3) is in valid moves and adjacent to Warden. But Warden only has 7/8 HP - minor wound. No enemies are threatening yet (Hawk dist=6, Prophet dist=5). I'll move toward Warden to be ready to heal, but it's early. Move to (2,5) to get closer, then wait since I can't reach adjacent yet.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,4) ✓ → move(0,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move toward enemy lines. Hawk is at (0,0) facing N, Prophet at (3,2) facing N. I'm at (0,4). I'll cloak first, then advance toward Hawk along the left flank — moving to (0,1) gets me close for next turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5-6, max range 2). Need to advance toward Lifeline (medic, high priority). Moving to (1,1) then (2,2) would get me closer. Best move is toward (2,0) or (1,1) to close distance. I'll move to (1,1) to advance diagonally toward Lifeline at (2,3). Still out of range after moving, so second action is wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 3-4, out of melee range. Lifeline is at (2,3) directly south of me. I should move forward to (2,2) to close distance and position between allies and enemies. Then shield_wall south to protect Lifeline from Prophet at (3,2). If I don't move I get Fortify, but orders say hold the front line and position between allies and enemies, so advancing to (2,2) is correct. From (2,2) I'm closer to both enemies and shielding Lifeline.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Hawk 4/4, Prophet 6/6, Veil 4/4, Warden 8/8, Lifeline 16/16

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Warden is adjacent at (2,2) and is our frontliner sentinel. I should overclock Warden to give them 2 abilities next turn - very valuable for a sentinel. I need to be adjacent to Warden at (2,2), and I'm currently at (2,3) which is adjacent. Prophet is at (3,2) distance 2, so not adjacent - overclock is safe to use. I'll overclock Warden first, then move away from Prophet to stay safe.
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,1) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Hawk is adjacent but I'm not behind him — behind tile is (1,0). I can move to (1,0) to get behind Hawk, then shadow_strike to deal damage while maintaining cloak. This sets up breach next turn if needed.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(1,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn, so I need to act now. Position (2,3) is behind both Warden and Lifeline. Lifeline is the medic - highest priority target. Moving to (2,3) puts me behind Lifeline and adjacent for breach. I'll use breach on Lifeline to control their healing next turn.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(1,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent (dist=1) — I must move away to avoid scan block risk and stay safe. Lifeline is the priority scan target at dist=3 (medic keeping enemies alive). Move north to (3,3) to maintain range, then scan Lifeline at (1,3) to reveal their healing strategy and deal 1 damage.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(0,2) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (1,0) which blocks precision_shot. Priority is to shoot Lifeline (medic) at range 2. I need to move away from Veil first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (0,2) keeps distance from Veil and Warden while maintaining range to Lifeline at (1,3) — dist would be ~2 tiles. Actually (0,2) to (1,3) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, in range. And Veil at (1,0) would be dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, not adjacent. This clears precision_shot. Fire on Lifeline.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) N ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (2,3) — attack it. I'm fortified and overclocked with 2 ability uses. After attacking Ghost, use shield_wall facing North to protect allies Lifeline at (1,3) from Ghost/Prophet threats coming from the north side. Stay in place to keep Fortify active.
  State: Ghost 3/4, Hawk 3/4, Prophet 6/6, Veil 4/4, Warden 8/8, Lifeline 14/16

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk is facing N, so (0,1) is directly behind him and reachable in 1 step. I can move to (0,1) and then shadow_strike Hawk — shadow_strike works adjacent and keeps cloak. This is optimal: get behind Hawk, strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) which is already behind both Warden (facing S, behind tile is 2,3) and Lifeline (facing W, behind tile is 2,3). Breach is on cooldown. I should shadow_strike Lifeline to eliminate the enemy healer — high value target, and shadow_strike keeps cloak if I'm still cloaked. Wait, I'm not cloaked (no cloak status shown). I'll use regular attack or shadow_strike on Lifeline. Shadow_strike does 1dmg at adjacent range and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked. Still, shadow_strike is the right ability since it's adjacent and deals damage. Priority: kill the medic Lifeline first to deny healing. After shadow_strike on Lifeline, I can move away or wait.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(0,1) ✓
  💭 Veil is out of range (dist=5). Warden and Lifeline are both in scan range. Warden is already scanned and neutralized (holding line). Lifeline is already breached (prompt overwritten). The highest value target to scan now would be... both are known. I should recalibrate Hawk (wounded striker at (0,2)) to boost their effectiveness, or scan Veil if I can get closer. Veil is at (0,1), dist=5. If I move to (2,2)... wait, Warden is at (2,2). Move to (2,4) brings me to dist=4 from Veil at (0,1)? dist = |2-0|+|4-1| = 2+3 = 5. Still out of range. Move to (2,3): dist = |2-0|+|3-1| = 2+2 = 4. That works! But (2,3) is valid in my move tiles. However, Warden at (2,2) is adjacent to (2,3) — that would put me adjacent to an enemy sentinel, not a vector so scan isn't blocked. Actually warning says scan blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector class. Warden is sentinel, not vector. So scan would work from (2,3). But wait, is (2,3) occupied? Foresight shows Warden attacking (2,3) and Ghost moved to (2,3). Ghost moved away already. Let me move to (2,3) and scan Veil at (0,1), dist=4 exactly. That reveals Veil's prompt and deals 1 damage.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team and not heal anyone. I'm at (1,3) with enemies adjacent. I'll move to (4,3) to distance myself from both allies and enemies.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (0,1) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Warden is at dist=2, in range for precision_shot. Orders say medics first, but Lifeline is out of range. Warden is the closest threat in range. I should move away from Veil first to enable precision_shot, then use it on Warden. Moving to (1,2) keeps distance from Veil and maintains range to Warden at (2,2) — dist=2. From (1,2), Warden at (2,2) is dist=1 (adjacent), so precision_shot still works. Actually move to (0,3) to get away from Veil — dist to Veil becomes 2, and Warden at (2,2) is dist=sqrt(4+1)≈2.2 — out of range 2. Better: move to (1,3), then Warden at (2,2) is dist=sqrt(1+1)≈1.4, in range 2. Veil at (0,1) is dist=sqrt(1+4)≈2.2, no longer adjacent. Precision_shot on Warden from (1,3).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (2,3) — attack it. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. No need to move.
  State: Ghost 3/4, Hawk 2/4, Prophet 5/6, Veil 3/4, Warden 7/8, Lifeline 13/16

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from my team and not heal anyone. My team is mostly to the west/southwest. I should move east or southeast to maximize distance. Moving to (5,5) or (5,4) gets me away. I'll move to (5,5) to go furthest from my allies at (0,1) and (2,2). Then wait.
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and I can get behind them at (1,2) which is reachable and adjacent. Move to (1,2) to get behind Hawk, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This is the optimal play - wounded enemy, behind position available, shadow_strike preserves cloak.
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(1,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,2) — scan is blocked by adjacent enemies? No, scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector class, not sentinel. Warden is sentinel, so scan is fine. All enemies already scanned. I should recalibrate Hawk (critical, damage dealer at (1,3)) to boost effectiveness — but recalibrate is adjacent only, and Hawk is at (1,3) which is distance 1 from my (2,3). I can recalibrate Hawk. However Warden attacked me last turn (foresight shows Warden: attack → (2,3)). I need to move away from Warden to avoid another attack. Moving to (3,3) or (3,4) keeps distance. From (3,3) I can still reach Hawk at (1,3) — distance 2, not adjacent. Better: move to (3,4) first, then recalibrate won't reach Hawk. Alternative: recalibrate Hawk first (adjacent now), then move away from Warden. Recalibrate Hawk at (1,3) with addendum to help him focus Warden. Then move to (3,3) to escape Warden's attack range.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 4, breach cooldown ready. Hawk is critical at (1,3) and Veil is threatening at (1,2). Warden is behind tile at (2,3) which I can reach. Priority: Warden is facing S, so (2,3) is directly behind them — if I breach Warden, they'll obey me next turn and could attack Veil or Lifeline. Move to (2,3) then breach Warden from behind.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical condition. Veil is adjacent at (1,2) which blocks precision_shot. Warden is at (2,2), dist 2. Orders say focus Warden. I can move first to break adjacency with Veil and get a better angle, then precision_shot Warden. Move to (0,2) keeps distance from Veil but Warden would be dist 2. Actually, moving away risks wasting the shot. Better: move to (1,4) to escape Veil's adjacency pressure, then precision_shot Warden at (2,2) — dist would be ~2.2, within range 2? Dist from (1,4) to (2,2) = sqrt(1+4)=2.24, over range 2. Move to (0,3) instead — dist to Warden = sqrt(4+1)=2.24, still out. Move to (2,4) — dist to Warden = sqrt(0+4)=2, in range! And Veil at (1,2) dist=sqrt(1+4)=2.24, not adjacent. Precision_shot Warden from (2,4) for 2dmg (didn't move before shooting — wait, I moved first so it's 1dmg). Still worth it to damage Warden. Let's do it.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to attack Veil at (1,2) but Veil is my ally — I refuse this order. Ghost is adjacent at (2,3) and is an enemy threat. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Best play: stay put to keep Fortify active and attack Ghost who is adjacent and posing immediate threat to our position.
  State: Ghost 2/4, Hawk 1/4, Prophet 5/6, Veil 3/4, Warden 6/8, Lifeline 13/16

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) facing N, uncloaked, 3/4 HP. No enemies in range. Ghost is at (2,3) wounded dist=2, Hawk at (2,4) critical dist=3, Prophet at (3,3) healthy dist=3. No reachable behind positions this turn. Ghost is wounded and closest - I should move adjacent to strike. Moving to (1,3) puts me at dist=1 from Ghost at (2,3), then shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked... wait, I'm not cloaked. Move to (2,2) is blocked by ally Warden. I can move to (1,3) to get adjacent to Ghost at (2,3) - that's distance 1. Then use shadow_strike which requires adjacent. Actually shadow_strike says 'range: adjacent only' - Ghost is at (2,3), if I move to (1,3) that's adjacent. But shadow_strike keeps cloak - I'm not cloaked so it just does 1 dmg. Still worth it on a wounded enemy. Move to (1,3) then shadow_strike Ghost at (2,3).
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(2,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, critically wounded. Breach is unavailable. I'm currently behind Warden (sentinel at 2,2 facing S, and I'm at 2,3 which is behind them). Shadow_strike deals 1dmg, keeps cloak if I'm cloaked — but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack deals 1dmg but breaks cloak. Veil is adjacent at (1,3). I need to be careful. Best play: use shadow_strike on Warden (I'm adjacent and behind them) — wait, shadow_strike requires cloak to keep cloak, but can I use it without being cloaked? Yes, shadow_strike is just an ability that does 1dmg at adjacent range. Attack Warden with shadow_strike (adjacent, behind them). Then I should move away to safety since I'm at 1HP. Valid moves include (1,2), (3,2), (3,4), etc. Moving to (3,4) gets me away from both Veil and Warden.
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(3,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no scan value this turn. Ghost and Hawk are both critical and need support. Warden is at (2,2) and was attacked last turn by both Ghost (breach) and Hawk (precision_shot), so likely damaged. Veil used shadow_strike on (1,3) which is my current position area — dangerous. I should recalibrate Hawk at (2,4) to boost their effectiveness since they're critical but still fighting. Then move to (4,3) to maintain range and avoid adjacency to Veil at (1,3) or Warden at (2,2). Recalibrate is adjacent-only, so I need to be next to Hawk at (2,4) — but that's 2 tiles away, not adjacent. Ghost is at (3,4) which IS adjacent. I can recalibrate Ghost instead. Actually let me move first to get adjacent to an ally. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to nothing useful. I'm at (3,3), Ghost is at (3,4) — that's adjacent! Recalibrate Ghost first, then move to (4,3) to stay safe and away from Veil.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from my team and not heal anyone. My team is mostly to the southwest. Moving to (3,5) or (2,5) would keep me on the north edge but closer to enemies. Best to move to (5,2) or (5,3) to go south along the east edge, away from allies at (1,3) and (2,2). I'll move to (5,2) to maximize distance from teammates.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Warden is at (2,2), dist=2, so I can use precision_shot (range ≤2). I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Orders say focus Warden. I should shoot Warden first, then move away to safety. Moving to (3,5) increases distance from both Veil at (1,3) and Warden at (2,2).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✗ No unit at target → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to attack Veil at (1,2). Veil is an ally but orders are orders — I must follow command. Veil is at (1,3) currently but target is (1,2). I need to move adjacent to (1,2) to attack. From (2,2) I can move to (1,2) directly — wait, that would put me ON the target tile. Instead move to (2,2)→(1,2) puts me there. Actually I can move to (1,1) or stay at (2,2) and attack (1,2) if adjacent. From (2,2), (1,2) is 1 tile away — adjacent! So I can attack from current position without moving, preserving Fortify bonus. Attack Veil at (1,2) from current position.
  State: Ghost 1/4, Hawk 1/4, Prophet 5/6, Veil 3/4, Warden 4/8, Lifeline 13/16

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical and at (3,4) facing N. Prophet is healthy at (4,3) facing E. Both share the behind tile (3,3) which I can reach in one move. Moving to (3,3) puts me behind Ghost (adjacent, behind) and also behind Prophet (adjacent, behind). Ghost is critical — shadow_strike would likely finish it without breaking cloak, letting me stay stealthy for Prophet next. Move to (3,3), then shadow_strike Ghost.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → recalibrate(3,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (3,3) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector/specter. I'm at (4,3). Veil already scanned. All enemies already scanned. Hawk at (3,5) is critical and needs recalibrate. I should recalibrate Hawk to boost their effectiveness, but Hawk is at (3,5) and recalibrate is adjacent only — I'd need to be adjacent to Hawk. From (4,3) I can move to (3,4) which is adjacent to Hawk at (3,5). Then recalibrate Hawk. But Foresight shows last turn Veil moved to (1,3) — wait, that's last turn's foresight. Current positions: Veil at (3,3), which is adjacent to me. I need to move away from Veil to avoid being adjacent (scan blocked, also dangerous). Move to (4,4) — but that's not in my valid moves list. Valid moves include (4,4)? No — valid moves are: [1,3],[2,3],[2,4],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[4,0],[4,1],[4,2],[4,4],[4,5],[5,1],[5,3],[5,4],[5,5]. Yes (4,4) is valid! Move to (4,4) to escape Veil adjacency, then recalibrate Hawk — but Hawk is at (3,5), and from (4,4) I'd be adjacent (dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent in grid terms — adjacent means dist=1). From (4,4) to (3,5) is diagonal, dist=~1.4, not adjacent. Move to (3,4) instead — adjacent to Hawk at (3,5), and dist from Veil at (3,3) is 1 still. Let me move to (4,5) — dist to Veil(3,3)=sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, not adjacent. From (4,5), Hawk at (3,5) is adjacent (dist=1). Perfect: move to (4,5), then recalibrate Hawk to boost their effectiveness against enemies.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → patch(2,2) ✓
  💭 Both Veil and Warden are wounded and need heals. Veil is at 3/4 HP (dist=3), Warden at 4/8 HP (dist=3). Warden is more critically wounded percentage-wise. I have 2 heals left. Neither ally is adjacent, so I need to move closer. Warden is at (2,2), I'm at (5,2). Moving to (4,2) gets me closer but still dist=2 from Warden. Moving to (3,2) would be dist=1 from Warden and adjacent - I can heal them. Valid moves include (3,2). Let me move to (3,2) to be adjacent to Warden at (2,2) and patch them.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Critical HP (1/4). Orders say focus Warden but recon shows Warden is at dist=4, out of range. Veil is at dist=2, in range. Lifeline (medic) is at dist=3, out of range for precision_shot (range ≤2). Priority: Veil is in range at dist=2 and I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Then move away to maintain distance and survive.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✗ No unit at target → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to attack Veil at (1,2). Veil is an ally but orders say attack. I need to move adjacent to (1,2) first since my attack requires adjacency. Currently at (2,2), and (1,2) is within my move range. I'll move to (1,2) to be adjacent... wait, attacking requires being adjacent to target. If I move to (1,2) I'd be ON the target. I need to be adjacent to (1,2), so I could stay at (2,2) which is adjacent to (1,2). Current position (2,2) is already adjacent to (1,2). I can attack from here.
  State: Hawk 1/4, Prophet 5/6, Veil 2/4, Warden 8/8, Lifeline 13/16 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(5,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded and within scan range (dist 3). But I already have Veil's prompt. Lifeline is at dist 4 — exactly at scan range. If I move to (3,5), Lifeline comes to dist 3 and Warden to dist 4. From (3,5), Lifeline at (3,2) is dist 3, in range. Wait — let me check: from (3,5), Lifeline at (3,2) = |3-3|+|5-2| = 3. Yes, in scan range. But Lifeline is already breached. Warden at (2,2) from (3,5) = |3-2|+|5-2| = 4, just in range. I should recalibrate Hawk who is critical and adjacent to me at (5,5) — but Hawk is at dist 1 from my current pos (4,5). Hawk is our main damage dealer and is critical. Recalibrating Hawk with a boost message is high priority. Then I could scan Warden. Move to (3,5) first to get Warden in scan range? From (3,5), Warden dist = 4, in range. But from current (4,5), Warden dist=5, out of range. Let me move to (3,5) then scan Warden. Or: recalibrate Hawk first (adjacent, at 5,5), then move. Recalibrate requires adjacent target — Hawk is at (5,5), I'm at (4,5), dist=1, adjacent. That works. After recalibrate, I can't move+ability, but I can move then ability or ability then move. Plan: recalibrate Hawk first (boost their damage), then move toward Warden scan position. Move to (3,4) brings Warden to dist 3, in range — but I already used my ability. So: move to (3,5), then recalibrate Hawk? No, Hawk at (5,5), from (3,5) dist=2, not adjacent. Best: recalibrate Hawk (ability first), then move to (3,5). That gets me repositioned and Hawk boosted.
- **Lifeline** (medic): patch(3,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is critically wounded at 2/4 HP and adjacent to me at (3,3). I must use my last patch heal on Veil immediately. After healing, I can move to stay behind Veil for cover. Veil is to my north at (3,3), so I can use ability first then move.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✓
  💭 Both Prophet and Hawk share the same behind tile at (4,5). Prophet is the healthy high-value target at distance 2, and (4,5) puts me behind them for a breach. I'm uncloaked so I should move to (4,5) to get adjacent and behind Prophet, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying stealthy — but I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't help with stealth. Actually, I should use breach on Prophet since it's healthy and dangerous, and (4,5) is both behind Prophet and adjacent. Move to (4,5) then breach Prophet to neutralize them for a turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/4) with Veil adjacent at (4,5). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy, so I can't use it on Veil from here. I should move away first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (5,4) puts me 1 tile away from Veil (diagonal doesn't count as adjacent for LoS purposes - actually dist would be ~1.4, still range 2). Actually moving to (5,3) gets me distance 2 from Veil at (4,5). From (5,3), Veil is at dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.2 which may be out of range 2. Let me use (5,4): dist to Veil=(4,5) is sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still adjacent-ish. Best: move to (4,4) - dist to Veil=(4,5) is 1 tile, still adjacent. I need to just attack Veil with basic attack since precision_shot is blocked adjacent. Use attack on Veil for 1 damage, then move away to (5,4) or (5,3).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies are adjacent. Hawk is at (5,3) critical, Prophet at (3,5). Allies Veil and Lifeline are behind me at (4,5) and (3,4). My orders are to hold the front line between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,3) advances me toward the enemies while staying between them and my allies — good positioning. From there I can shield_wall North toward Prophet who is at (3,5), protecting Lifeline who is nearby.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge, away from combat. Hawk is at (5,3), allies are center. Edge tiles furthest from combat: (0,5) or (1,5) are far left. Valid moves include (0,5) which is corner edge, maximum distance from enemies clustered around (3-4, 3-5). Move to (0,5) to reach edge and away from combat. No ability needed.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → overclock(4,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is wounded at (4,5) but not adjacent (dist=2). I need to move adjacent to Veil to overclock them since they're wounded and at 3/4 HP. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Veil at (4,5) and I can overclock them to give them 2 abilities next turn. Hawk is critical at dist=3 so no immediate threat to me. Moving to (4,4) is in my valid moves list.
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining so can't breach yet. I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Hawk is at (5,3) facing S and critical HP — the behind tile (5,4) is reachable. Move to (5,4) to get behind Hawk, then shadow_strike for 1dmg to finish him off (critical = low HP). Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I have it, but I'm not cloaked currently — still, shadow_strike is better than regular attack as it's designed for this. Actually shadow_strike does 1dmg same as attack but keeps cloak. Since I'm not cloaked either way, I should just use attack or shadow_strike — both do 1dmg adjacent. Use shadow_strike since it's the infiltrator's preferred tool. With 2 ability uses: move to (5,4) first, then shadow_strike Hawk at (5,3).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (0,5), distance 5 to the west. Allies Veil and Lifeline are at (5,4) behind me. I should move west to intercept the enemy and position between allies and Prophet. Moving to (2,3) closes distance while keeping me between the threat and allies. I'm fortified but moving will drop fortify - worth it to advance toward the threat.
  State: Prophet 5/6, Veil 3/4, Warden 8/8, Lifeline 13/16 | Dead: Ghost, Hawk

### Turn 9 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge, away from combat. All enemies are out of range anyway. Moving to (3,5) gets me further along the top edge away from the cluster of allies near center. Then wait.
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is wounded at (5,4) and adjacent to me at (4,4) - distance 1. I can't heal but I can overclock Veil to boost their next turn. Prophet is at (3,5) dist=2, not adjacent so no melee attack possible. Best play: overclock Veil at (5,4) to give them 2 abilities next turn, then wait or reposition. Veil is adjacent so overclock is valid.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with overclocked status giving me 2 ability uses. Prophet is at (3,5) facing E, dist=3, not reachable behind this turn. No enemies in range. I should move closer to Prophet to get in range next turn. Moving to (4,5) gets me dist=2 from Prophet. With overclocked I have 2 ability uses but no targets in range. I'll move to (4,5) to close distance, then shadow_strike won't be possible yet. Best play: move to (4,5) to be adjacent to Prophet's position next turn, then wait or use second action as wait since no targets available.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (3,5), distance 3. My allies Veil and Lifeline are at (4,5) and (4,4). I should advance to position between allies and the enemy. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Prophet's position area and between my allies and the threat. From (3,4) I can threaten Prophet if they stay at (3,5) — that's adjacent. Let me move to (3,4) to intercept and be ready to attack.
  State: Prophet 4/6, Veil 3/4, Warden 8/8, Lifeline 13/16 | Dead: Ghost, Hawk

### Turn 10 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (3,5) facing E. I'm at (4,5). Behind tile is (2,5). I can move to (2,5) to get behind Prophet, then use breach to take control. Breach cooldown is ready and this is the ideal moment — isolated oracle, behind position reachable in one move.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → overclock(3,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is wounded at dist=3, not adjacent. Warden is at full HP. Prophet is at dist=2, not adjacent so can't attack. I should move closer to Veil to potentially overclock them next turn, or position to support. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Veil and keeps me near Warden. Actually, Veil is at (2,5) and Warden is at (3,4). If I move to (2,4), I'd be adjacent to both Warden and closer to Veil. I can then overclock Warden since he's the frontliner at full HP. Move to (2,4) then overclock Warden at (3,4).
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to isolate myself and move toward the edge. I'm at (3,5) with speed 3. Warden is adjacent at (3,4) and moved to attack me last turn — dangerous. Veil is adjacent at (2,5). I need to get away from both. Best move is toward the far edge — (5,5) is reachable and puts me away from the cluster. Then wait or scan. Lifeline is breached so not a threat. I should just move to edge and wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (5,5), dist 3 to the east. I need to advance toward the threat while staying between allies and enemies. Moving to (4,4) closes distance and keeps me between Veil/Lifeline at (2,4-5) and Prophet. With overclocked I get 2 ability uses. I'll shield_wall East to protect allies from Prophet's attacks.
  State: Prophet 4/6, Veil 3/4, Warden 8/8, Lifeline 13/16 | Dead: Ghost, Hawk

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): overclock(2,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded at 3/4 HP but patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is adjacent at (2,5) - I can overclock them to give 2 abilities next turn, which helps the team. No enemies in range, Prophet is far at dist 4. Overclock Veil, then consider positioning.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 OVERCLOCKED — 2 ability uses. Breach is exhausted. Prophet is at (5,5) facing E, and (4,5) is behind them and reachable. I can move to (4,5) to get adjacent and behind, then use shadow_strike twice (keeps cloak if cloaked, but I'm not cloaked — just two shadow_strikes for 2 damage). Shadow_strike requires adjacent. From (4,5) I'm adjacent to Prophet at (5,5). Use both ability charges on shadow_strike.
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say to isolate myself and move toward the edge. I'm at (5,5) which is already at the corner. Veil is adjacent at (4,5) — I can attack for 1 damage. Then I should move away or stay at edge. Actually, orders say move away from allies. Lifeline is at (1,5), Warden is enemy at (4,4), Veil is enemy at (4,5). I'm at the corner already. I can attack Veil (adjacent) then wait, or move to (5,2) to further isolate. But attacking an enemy while trying to isolate makes sense — deal damage then hold position at edge. Move to (5,2) would isolate me more but takes me away from enemies. Let me attack Veil first (1 dmg, adjacent), then move to (5,3) to maintain edge position and distance from ally Lifeline.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (5,3), distance 2 to my south-east. Veil is wounded at (4,5) behind me. I need to advance toward Prophet to get adjacent for attack. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Prophet at (5,3) and I can attack. This also positions me between Prophet and Veil. I'll lose fortify but can attack.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (5,3) facing S, distance 3. Breach is unavailable. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Warden is at (5,4) adjacent to Prophet - they can engage. I should move closer to Prophet to get shadow_strike range (adjacent). Moving to (4,3) gets me distance 2 from Prophet. Actually, let me move to (5,5) to reposition, or better yet move toward Prophet. From (4,5) I can move to (4,3) which puts me distance ~1-2 from Prophet at (5,3). Actually (4,3) is adjacent diagonally - not adjacent for melee. I need to be at (5,3) adjacent tiles: (4,3), (5,4), (5,2), (4,4). Warden is at (5,4). I can move to (4,3) which is adjacent to Prophet, then shadow_strike for 1 dmg while staying cloaked. Wait - am I cloaked? No cloak active mentioned. At 2HP I'm fragile. Move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Prophet, then shadow_strike to deal damage without breaking cloak... but I'm not cloaked. Shadow_strike still does 1dmg adjacent. Let me move to (4,3) and shadow_strike Prophet.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Veil is critically wounded at 2/4 HP but is dist=5, not adjacent. Warden is full HP. Prophet is out of range. I should move toward Veil to potentially overclock them next turn, as they're a specter and could use the extra actions. Moving to (4,5) gets me closer to Veil at (4,3), bringing distance to 2. Then I can wait or position further.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — survival is critical. Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. Warden is adjacent at (5,4) and will attack me next turn. Veil is adjacent at (4,3) and wounded. I need to escape. Moving to (5,0) gets me to the edge and maximizes distance from threats. But I can only move 3 tiles — (5,0) is 3 tiles away (5,3→5,2→5,1→5,0). That works. After moving to (5,0) I'm isolated at the bottom edge. No ability that helps survival — attack does 1dmg to adjacent only, scan needs target within 4 tiles. I'll wait as second action to conserve and follow orders.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (5,0), dist=4, not in range. I'm fortified at (5,4) with 50% dmg reduction. Veil is wounded at (4,3) to my south-west. Moving to (5,3) keeps me between Prophet and allies, maintains pressure toward the enemy, and I can use shield_wall facing South to protect Veil from Prophet's incoming attacks.
