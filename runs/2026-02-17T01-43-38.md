## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan the battlefield with foresight each turn. Focus mind_spike on wounded enemies to secure kills. Stay behind allies and maintain range."
### Opponent
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies out of range. Move forward to (3,3) to close distance while maintaining formation with allies. This puts Bolt at distance 3 next turn for precision_shot.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is in range at (3,3) distance 3. I can precision_shot without moving for full 2dmg. Stay at (2,5) to maintain high ground bonus and range advantage.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies out of scan range (>4 tiles). Move forward to (2,2) to close distance while staying behind Warden. Next turn can scan when enemies are within 4 tiles.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 Push forward aggressively toward enemy cluster at (2-3, 1-3). Move to (1,4) to advance while staying near allies. Use shield_wall facing South to protect allies Bolt and Lattice from the enemy cluster ahead.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → pulse(3,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and at distance 3. Move to (3,4) to get adjacent, then pulse to damage Hawk and potentially catch other enemies in the AoE. This pressures the wounded striker while controlling the center.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Advance toward nearest enemies (all at dist 4). Move north toward Bolt/Rampart cluster. After moving to (2,3), use shield_wall facing North to protect against the enemy formation above.
  State: Warden 10/10, Hawk 1/4, Insight 8/8, Rampart 10/10, Bolt 4/4, Lattice 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is critical (1HP) and was hit by Lattice's pulse last turn. Enemy Bolt can finish Hawk with precision_shot. I should scan Bolt to reveal their targeting logic and potentially disrupt their kill shot. Staying at (2,2) keeps me behind Warden's shield wall and away from enemy Lattice's denial range.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Adjacent to Lattice's denial zone - abilities blocked. Must move away first. At 1HP, critically wounded. Retreat south to (3,1) for distance, then basic attack Lattice if possible next turn.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is critical (1hp) but out of range. Warden and Insight are in range. Priority: finish wounded enemies first. Hawk is at (3,1), dist=5. I need to close distance. Move to (3,5) puts me at dist=4 to Hawk, still out of range. Move to (4,5) puts me at dist=5 still. Better: precision_shot Insight now (3dmg, in range), then reposition next turn for Hawk.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) E ✓
  💭 Warden is 2 tiles away at (2,3). Move to (1,3) to get adjacent, then shield_wall facing East to protect allies from the enemy cluster (Warden/Insight to the east).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall W ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (1,3). Attack him first, then shield_wall facing west to protect allies from his direction.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Warden is adjacent at range 2. Move to (2,4) to get adjacent and apply Denial passive, blocking their shield_wall ability. Then pulse to damage both Warden and nearby Rampart if positioned right, or trap a chokepoint.
  State: Warden 10/10, Hawk 1/4, Insight 6/8, Rampart 9/10, Bolt 4/4, Lattice 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(1,3) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) at (2,4) is only 2 tiles away and will block my abilities if I move adjacent. Rampart (sentinel) at (1,3) is unscanned and in range. I should scan Rampart to reveal their prompt for tactical advantage, then move away from Lattice to maintain safe distance.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 Hawk is critical (1HP) at range 4, out of precision_shot range. Must close distance to finish. Move south to (3,4) puts Hawk at dist 3 for precision_shot kill.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,3) E ✓ → attack(1,2) ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent. Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Warden at (2,3) is east, Insight at (1,2) is south. Main threat cluster appears east. Use shield_wall facing east to protect allies from Warden, then attack Insight who is also adjacent.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden adjacent at (2,3). My denial passive blocks their abilities. I'll pulse to damage Warden, then move to (3,3) to stay in denial range while positioning for trap placement next turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Rampart and Lattice are both adjacent. Orders say attack if adjacent. Most enemies are to the east (Bolt, Lattice, Rampart is west). Attack Rampart first (closer to orders 'nearest'), then shield_wall facing E to protect against Bolt/Lattice.
  State: Warden 9/10, Insight 5/8, Rampart 8/10, Bolt 3/4, Lattice 6/6 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 4 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Lattice at (3,3) is in scan range (dist=3). Scanning now before it moves closer will reveal its prompt. Then move away from Rampart to avoid being adjacent to enemies.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at distance 2, healthy. Can precision_shot for 2dmg without moving first. Stay at range, avoid close combat.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) E ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Warden first, then shield_wall facing East to protect allies from the enemy cluster.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,3). Use Denial passive to block their abilities. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - will damage Warden. Then move to control chokepoint.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Adjacent to Rampart and Lattice. Lattice's DENIAL blocks abilities. Attack Rampart first (adjacent enemy), then shield_wall facing East (where Bolt and Lattice are).
  State: Warden 6/10, Insight 5/8, Rampart 7/10, Bolt 2/4, Lattice 6/6 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 5 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and in range at dist=2. Use precision_shot to finish them off. No need to move since I have clear LoS and range.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,2) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✗ Cannot use scan — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Bolt is wounded and will precision_shot Warden again. I need to scan Bolt's position to give Warden intel for defense. But Bolt is at (3,4), distance 5, out of my scan range (4). I should move closer to (1,2) which puts me distance 3 from Bolt, then scan.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) adjacent at (2,2) with DENIAL active - blocks my abilities. Rampart (sentinel) adjacent at (1,3). Orders: advance + shield_wall toward most enemies, or attack if adjacent. Attack Lattice first to remove DENIAL threat, then shield_wall facing E where Bolt/Lattice/Rampart cluster.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent. Warden wounded at (2,3), Insight healthy at (1,2). Orders say attack when possible. I'm fortified so I have damage reduction. Attack Warden first to finish the wounded enemy, then move forward to maintain pressure.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent. Pulse hits both for 1dmg (Warden 3→2HP, Insight 6→5HP). My Denial passive blocks their abilities. Then move to (3,3) to maintain denial on Warden while creating distance from Insight.
  State: Warden 3/10, Insight 4/8, Rampart 7/10, Bolt 2/4, Lattice 5/6 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 6 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies wounded and in range. Warden at dist=2 is priority threat. Kill Warden with precision_shot, then kill Insight with second precision_shot.
- **Insight** (oracle): mind_spike(3,4) ✗ Unknown ability: mind_spike → wait ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded and at max range (4 tiles). Mind_spike can finish them. Need to stay away from Lattice (vector) to avoid denial blocking my abilities. Current position is safe.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical and adjacent. Pulse will hit Warden (1 tile away) for lethal damage. Then move to maintain board control.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) to the north. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified with 1HP - need to be cautious. Shield_wall facing north protects against Rampart/Bolt direction where most enemies are (2 enemies N/NE). Attack Rampart first since adjacent, then shield_wall north.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall S ✓
  💭 Warden is critical and adjacent. Attack to finish them off, then shield_wall facing south to protect Bolt and support the push.
  State: Insight 2/8, Rampart 6/10, Bolt 1/4, Lattice 5/6 | Dead: Warden, Hawk
