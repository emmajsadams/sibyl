I need to be adjacent to Phantom to use patch. Phantom is at (1,1). Adjacent tiles: (0,1),(2,1),(1,0),(1,2). I can reach (1,2) but that's where Bulwark is. I can reach (0,2) in mv2 from (1,3). From (0,2) to (1,1) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41 — not adjacent in grid terms (need same row/col or diagonal? No, this is grid — manhattan dist=2). Actually adjacent means dist=1 manhattan. (0,2) to (1,1): |0-1|+|2-1|=2. Not adjacent. What about moving to (0,3) then... no, one move. Can I reach any tile adjacent to Phantom (1,1)? Adjacent to (1,1): (0,1),(2,1),(1,0),(1,2).

Maybe overclock Rampart who is adjacent at (2,3)? But orders say patch most wounded. Can't reach Phantom. Move to (1,4) or (0,2) to reposition. Actually, let me check (0,2): from (1,3), dist=|1-0|+|3-2|=2, reachable. From (0,2), Phantom at (1,1) dist=|0-1|+|2-1|=2, still not adjacent. Hmm. Bulwark is blocking (1,2). No path to get adjacent to Phantom this turn. Move toward Phantom, then next turn heal. Move to (0,2), and wait or overclock Rampart (adjacent at (2,3), dist=|1-2|+|3-3|=1 — adjacent).
