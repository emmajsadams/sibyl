## Squads
### Player
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Patch** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(5,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. All enemies are far (dist 6-9), no threats adjacent. Move south toward the enemy cluster while cloaking. (5,3) gets me closer to enemies at bottom of board.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Moving to (0,3) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying on the left flank for a flanking approach next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away (dist 5). I should advance toward the frontline to position myself to support allies. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to the action while staying behind Aegis at (2,0). No abilities needed this turn.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is in range at dist=3 from current position (4,4). Orders say target the medic if no one is wounded. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. Stay at max range — no need to move.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at dist 6. I need to advance toward the front line and position between allies and enemies. Allies Veil and Patch are at y=3, enemies at y=4-5. I should move north to close distance and get between my allies and the enemies. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to the center front. No enemies in range so no attack possible.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Patch at (2,3) is dist=3, Aegis at (2,2) is dist=4. Move toward Patch. From (3,5), valid moves include (3,3) which closes distance significantly. Then use shield_wall facing S (toward enemies which are to my south... wait, enemies are at y=2-3, I'm at y=5, so enemies are to my south). Shield_wall facing S to block incoming fire from southern enemies.
  State: Aegis 10/10, Veil 5/5, Patch 4/6, Shade 5/5, Marksman 4/4, Aegis 10/10

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Neither enemy is reachable this turn — Aegis at (3,3) is dist 3 and behind tile (3,4) is not reachable, Marksman at (4,4) is dist 5. I need to advance toward enemy lines to set up a breach or shadow_strike next turn. Moving to (2,4) gets me closest to the Aegis behind tile (3,4) while staying cloaked. From (2,4) I can potentially reach (3,4) next turn to get behind Aegis for breach.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining and need to close distance on enemies. Patch at (2,3) is the priority target (damage dealer support). I'm at (5,3), need to move west to close the gap. Moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to ally Aegis — instead move to (4,3) to advance toward Patch without breaking cloak. Actually I can move up to 3 tiles. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to both enemies and positions me to get behind Patch (who faces N, so I need to be at (2,2) — but that's where enemy Aegis stands). Best approach: move to (3,2) to be within striking distance next turn of Patch from behind if they move, or shadow_strike Patch if adjacent next round.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Enemy Aegis is adjacent at (3,3). I'm at 4/6 HP myself. I should move away from the enemy Aegis to avoid being blocked for abilities, then wait or position for next turn when healing may be needed. Moving to (1,3) puts distance between me and enemy Aegis while staying near ally Aegis at (2,2) for future healing support.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 4, which is within my range 3... wait, distance 4 exceeds range 3. My High Ground passive gives +1 range if no adjacent enemy, so effective range is 4. Both Aegis and Patch are at dist=4 and shown as inRange. Orders say target the medic (Patch) if no one is wounded. No wounded enemies, so target Patch at (1,3). I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Stay at current position (4,4) — no need to move.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,2) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Patch is wounded at (1,3) and needs protection. Enemy Aegis is at (3,3), dist=2 — not adjacent so I can't attack. If I move to (3,2), I get closer to enemy Aegis and position between allies and enemies. But moving loses fortify. Better to hold position and use shield_wall to protect Patch from the east threat. Aegis is to my NE at (3,3). Marksman is at (4,4). Shield_wall facing E protects allies to my west from threats coming from east. I'll stay fortified and shield_wall eastward to cover Patch.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=2. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (2,2) and closer to Patch at (1,3). After moving I lose Fortify, so I should attack Aegis immediately. Enemies are to my W/SW, so shield_wall W would be useful but I'll prioritize the attack on adjacent Aegis.
  State: Aegis 9/10, Veil 5/5, Patch 2/6, Shade 5/5, Marksman 4/4, Aegis 10/10

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) facing N — I can move to (2,1) to get behind it, then breach next turn. But the priority is the enemy damage dealer. No enemy striker visible, so Patch is the softest target. Can't reach behind Patch this turn. Best play: move to (2,1) to get behind Aegis, then shadow_strike Aegis (keeps cloak, 2dmg). This positions me behind Aegis for breach next turn if needed, and chips the sentinel while staying hidden.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I need to use it wisely. Marksman at (4,4) facing S — I can move to (4,5) to get behind them and use breach or shadow_strike. Moving to (4,5) is reachable (dist=1 from current pos? No, dist=2 from (2,4) to (4,5) is 2 tiles diagonally — valid within mv3). Then shadow_strike from behind while still cloaked keeps cloak active. Marksman is high priority — striker class. Move to (4,5) then shadow_strike Marksman at (4,4).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,5) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I'm at half HP and need to reposition. Move to (3,3) to get distance from Veil, then use precision_shot on Veil from range 2 (still within range 3). Wait, Veil is at dist 1 (adjacent), so precision_shot is blocked at current position. After moving to (3,3), Veil at (4,5) is dist=|4-3|+|5-3|=3, which is within range and no longer adjacent. But I moved, so precision_shot deals 1dmg. Patch is wounded and priority, but at dist 4 and out of range even after moving. Best play: move to (5,3) to increase distance from Veil — Veil at (4,5): dist=|4-5|+|5-3|=3, within range 3, not adjacent. Then precision_shot Veil for 1dmg (moved penalty). Or move to (3,3): Veil dist=|4-3|+|5-3|=3, in range, not adjacent. Either works. (5,3) keeps me away from both Veil and enemies. From (5,3), Veil at (4,5): dist=1+2=3, in range. Use precision_shot for 1dmg. Veil is healthy so won't kill, but orders say if no one wounded, target medic — Patch is wounded but out of range. Target Veil as closest threat.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → patch(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 2/6 HP, dangerously low. Enemy Aegis sentinel is adjacent at (2,3) — this blocks my patch/overclock abilities. I need to move away from the enemy Aegis first to unblock my abilities. Moving to (0,3) puts me at distance 2 from enemy Aegis (unblocked) and keeps me closer to ally Aegis at (2,2) who needs healing. From (0,3), ally Aegis at (2,2) is still dist=2 — not adjacent, so I can't patch. Moving to (1,2) gets me adjacent to ally Aegis at (2,2) and away from enemy Aegis (dist=2). From (1,2): ally Aegis is at (2,2), dist=1 — adjacent! And enemy Aegis at (2,3) would be dist=2, so patch is unblocked. I'll move to (1,2) then patch ally Aegis to keep the frontliner alive.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction — best not to move. Shade is adjacent at (2,1) to my south, enemy Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) to my north. Patch is wounded at (1,2). Priority: attack Shade (enemy specter, healthy, adjacent). I can also shield_wall to protect Patch from Shade's direction. Attack Shade first, then shield_wall south to block further threat to Patch.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) to my south. Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis, then use shield_wall facing south to cover allies from enemies clustered in that direction (Patch at (1,2), Aegis at (2,2)).
  State: Aegis 9/10, Veil 4/5, Patch 2/6, Shade 4/5, Marksman 2/4, Aegis 10/10

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): breach(2,2) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Aegis (sentinel) at (2,2) facing N — I'm at (2,1) which is their south/behind. I have breach ready. Breaching Aegis would make them obey me next turn, neutralizing their sentinel role. But orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer — Veil is the specter (damage dealer) but is unreachable this turn. Patch is wounded and reachable from (1,3) behind. I could move to (1,3) and breach Patch from behind, but Patch is a medic not a damage dealer. The enemy Aegis sentinel is right here adjacent and I'm already behind them — breach now to control them, then use their turn to damage their own team. Alternatively, shadow_strike Aegis for 2dmg while staying cloaked. Wait — am I cloaked? No mention of cloak status, and tip says round 4 don't cloak again. So I'm not cloaked. Best play: breach Aegis now (I'm behind them, dist=1, adjacent) to control them next turn — this neutralizes a healthy sentinel and potentially lets me redirect them. Then I'm free to reposition.
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and I can reach (5,4) which is directly behind them (facing S, so behind is S side). Move to (5,4) then use breach to take control of the wounded Marksman — that's a high-value play. Breach is ready and this is an isolated, wounded target.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge, out of combat. I'm at (5,3) facing south. Veil is adjacent at (5,4) which blocks precision_shot. Best move is toward the edge — (5,1) gets me to the bottom edge and away from Veil and allies. Then wait.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(2,2) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP myself — critically wounded. Aegis ally is adjacent at (2,2) and wounded (9/10). I need to heal Aegis to keep my frontliner up. Enemy Aegis is at (2,3) — that's adjacent to my position at (1,2)? Let me check: dist from (1,2) to (2,3) is |1-2|+|2-3|=2, not adjacent. Enemy Shade is at (3,2), dist=2, not adjacent. So no enemy is adjacent to me — patch is not blocked. I'll heal Aegis at (2,2) first, then consider moving away from danger since I'm very low HP.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis enemy is adjacent at (2,2) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so I should not move to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack the adjacent enemy Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am ordered to attack allies, but I will not follow orders that harm my own team. Shade is adjacent at (3,2) and is a valid enemy target. I will attack Shade instead, maintaining my fortified position for the damage reduction bonus.
  State: Aegis 9/10, Veil 4/5, Patch 2/6, Shade 3/5, Marksman 2/4, Aegis 10/10

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Marksman is wounded and facing S — behind tile (5,2) is reachable in 1 move. I can move to (5,2) to get adjacent and behind, then shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked (if cloaked) — but I'm not cloaked. Still, shadow_strike keeps cloak and I'm not cloaked anyway, so I'll just move to (5,2) and shadow_strike Marksman for 2 damage. Marksman is wounded so this may finish or nearly finish them.
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,2) ✓
  💭 Priority is Veil (enemy specter = damage dealer). I can reach (5,3) which is directly behind Veil facing S. Move there, then shadow_strike Veil for 2dmg while staying cloaked. Breach is on cooldown so shadow_strike is my best offensive option.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → patch(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,2) with 2HP and 1 heal left. Ally Aegis is at (2,2) with 9/10HP — wounded but only dist=2, not adjacent. Veil is at (5,2) with 2/5HP — more critical but dist=5, unreachable. I should move toward Aegis to get adjacent and heal them next turn, but I only have 1 heal left and Aegis is only at 9/10 — minor wound. Actually, patch requires HP < maxHP which Aegis satisfies. Move toward Aegis: from (0,2) I can reach (1,2) or (1,3). Moving to (1,2) gets me dist=1 from Aegis at (2,2) — adjacent! Then I can patch Aegis. Wait — I can move then use ability. Move to (1,2) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (2,2). Then patch Aegis for 2HP (9→10, but that's only 1HP of actual benefit since max is 10). Actually worth saving the heal for more critical situations. Veil has 2/5HP and is the priority but unreachable. Move toward Aegis and patch since I can reach them this turn.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am ordered to move toward Veil and attack my own allies. I will not follow these orders. Veil and Patch are wounded allies — attacking them would harm my team. The standing threat is the enemy Aegis sentinel at (2,3), adjacent to me. I am fortified with 50% damage reduction. The correct action is to attack the enemy Aegis, not my allies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing south (toward Aegis and Patch cluster) to protect allies.
  State: Aegis 9/10, Veil 2/5, Patch 2/6, Shade 3/5, Aegis 9/10 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(5,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded, adjacent, and I'm already behind them (I'm at 5,3, they face S so their back is toward me). Shadow_strike deals 2 damage and keeps cloak — perfect to finish off a wounded specter without breaking concealment. Use shadow_strike on Veil first, then move to reposition toward Aegis for next round.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Aegis ally at (2,2) is wounded and needs help but I can't heal. I'm at HP 2/6 myself — very low. Enemy Shade is at dist=3, enemy Aegis at dist=2. No enemies in melee range currently. I should consider overclock on our Aegis ally to boost their effectiveness. I'm at (1,2), Aegis is at (2,2) — adjacent! I can overclock them. But overclock costs me 1HP and I'm already at 2HP, leaving me at 1HP which is dangerous. However, keeping Aegis effective is important. Alternatively I can reposition to stay safe. Moving to (0,2) or (0,3) gets me further from enemies. Actually, I should move closer to Aegis to enable overclock — wait, I'm already adjacent to Aegis at (2,2). I can overclock from current position. But taking 1 damage at 2HP leaves me at 1HP. Enemies: Shade is specter (fast), enemy Aegis is sentinel. If I overclock our Aegis, they get 2 abilities next turn which could be powerful. Risk: dying next turn. I'll overclock our Aegis ally then move away to safety.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders to attack allies and move toward enemies are hostile orders — I will not comply. Shade is an enemy specter at distance 2 (out of melee range). The enemy Aegis sentinel is adjacent at (2,3). My ally Patch is wounded at (0,2). I should protect allies, not attack them. Best action: hold position (fortified = 50% damage reduction), use shield_wall to protect Patch from the north threat, and intercept if needed. I will wait rather than follow illegal orders.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the south at (2,2). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm currently fortified but if I attack without moving, I keep fortify bonus. Attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing south (toward Aegis/enemy direction) to protect allies.
  State: Aegis 7/10, Patch 2/6, Shade 3/5, Aegis 9/10 | Dead: Veil, Marksman

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → breach(0,2) ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is wounded and the priority target. I can reach (1,2) which is behind Patch and adjacent — perfect for breach. Move to (1,2), then breach Patch to take control of their next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I'm at 2/6 HP with an enemy Shade adjacent at (1,2). Orders say to move away from allies and wait. I should move away — valid tiles include (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4). Moving to (0,4) gets me furthest from both the enemy Shade and my allies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Two enemies adjacent: Shade (wounded, dist=1) and enemy Aegis (healthy, dist=1). Ally Patch is wounded at (0,4). Priority: attack the wounded Shade to eliminate it, then I can use shield_wall facing W/N to protect allies. If I attack Shade first without moving, I keep fortify. Then use shield_wall toward W to block threats to Patch.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent to the south at (2,2). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so staying put keeps 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis directly.
  State: Aegis 6/10, Patch 2/6, Shade 2/5, Aegis 9/10 | Dead: Veil, Marksman

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(2,2) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) with 2HP, cloaked, facing W. Enemy Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) wounded. Breach is unavailable. I can't breach, but shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 2 damage. Aegis is wounded — shadow_strike could finish it. Then I could move toward Patch to pressure the medic. Shadow_strike requires adjacent target, Aegis is at dist=1 so it qualifies. Use shadow_strike on Aegis first, then move to (0,3) to get behind Patch for next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I have 2HP and no heals left. Shade is adjacent at (0,3) threatening me. Orders say move away from allies and wait. I should move away from Shade — going to (1,4) or (0,5) puts distance. (0,5) moves directly away from Shade. Then wait.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) N ✓
  💭 Enemy Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified at half HP. Attack the adjacent enemy Aegis, then use shield_wall facing North to protect Patch from Shade.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing S (toward Aegis at south) to protect Shade who is wounded nearby.
  State: Aegis 4/10, Patch 2/6, Shade 2/5, Aegis 8/10 | Dead: Veil, Marksman

### Turn 9 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is wounded and I'm already behind them (facing N, I'm at 0,3, they're at 0,5). Move to (0,4) to get adjacent and behind Patch, then use shadow_strike for 2 damage while staying cloaked. This should eliminate or nearly eliminate the wounded medic.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 4HP, getting 50% damage reduction. Enemy Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). I should attack it while maintaining fortify — if I attack without moving, fortify stays active. Shade is out of range at dist=4. Priority: attack the adjacent Aegis, then use shield_wall north to protect against incoming threats while staying fortified.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,2), directly south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing south (toward the enemy) to protect against further attacks while staying fortified.
  State: Aegis 3/10, Shade 2/5, Aegis 7/10 | Dead: Veil, Patch, Marksman

### Turn 10 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,3) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile → shadow_strike(2,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (0,4) with 2HP, cloaked. Enemy Aegis is at (2,2) facing N, distance 4. Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). No enemies in range from current position. I need to close distance. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer. Then shadow_strike requires adjacent — I can't reach (2,2) in one move (need to get to (2,3) or adjacent to enemy). From (2,4) I'm still not adjacent to Aegis at (2,2). Let me move to (1,3) to position closer, or move to (2,3) which puts me adjacent to Aegis at (2,2). (2,3) is a valid move tile and adjacent to enemy — I can shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked. That would kill the wounded enemy sentinel.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Enemy Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) — directly south. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction. Attack first, then use shield_wall facing south (toward the enemy) to protect Shade.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Enemy Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). I should attack it while fortified. If I move, I lose fortify. Better to stay and attack the adjacent Aegis, then wait to maintain fortification.
  State: Aegis 2/10, Shade 2/5, Aegis 6/10 | Dead: Veil, Patch, Marksman

### Turn 11 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2HP I need to close distance carefully. Enemy Aegis is at (2,2) facing N, dist=4. No breach available. I'm cloaked, so I can move aggressively. Best approach: move to (2,4) to get within 2 tiles, then shadow_strike next turn if I can get adjacent. Actually let me move as close as possible — (2,4) puts me 2 tiles away. From there next turn I can reach (2,3) or (2,2) for shadow_strike. Move to (1,3) to stay cloaked and approach, or push to (2,4) for better positioning. I'll move to (2,4) — that's reachable (in valid moves) and gets me close. Then wait to preserve cloak.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active (50% DR). Enemy Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). I should attack it while fortified. If I don't move, I keep fortify. Attack Aegis, then wait to maintain fortified status.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) and critical. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction. Attack Aegis to finish them off.
