## Squads
### Player
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Pulse** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Lifeline (closest enemy at dist 4). Move to (4,2) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (closest is Lifeline at dist=5, my range is 3). I need to advance toward enemies to get into firing range. Moving to (5,2) brings me 2 tiles south, getting closer to Lifeline at (3,1). From (5,2), Lifeline is still at dist=4, still out of range. Best option is to move to (4,3) to get closer while maintaining some distance, or move to (5,2). Actually, moving to (4,3) puts me at dist=4 from Lifeline still. No shot this turn regardless. I'll advance toward center to position for next round while staying back from the front. Move to (4,3) to get into a better firing position next turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → move(1,1) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 7-8, my range is 3). I need to advance toward them. Moving to (1,1) gets me closer while staying off the edge, then moving to (1,2) or similar. With mv2, I can reach (0,2) or (1,1). I'll move northeast toward the enemies to close distance.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are out of range. I should advance toward the frontline to be in position to support Hawk (striker) who will likely engage soon. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to the action while staying behind our striker.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Lifeline (enemy medic) is closest at dist=2, south of me. Deadeye is my damage dealer at (4,3), dist=3. I should move toward Deadeye to stay near my damage dealer and use overclock on them next turn when adjacent. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Deadeye and keeps me away from enemy Lifeline.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,0) ✓ → shield_wall(3,0) N ✓
  💭 Enemies are clustered at (4,3) and (4,4), distance 5-6. I need to push forward aggressively. Moving to (4,0) gets me closest to the enemy cluster. No attack range yet, so I'll move max distance toward enemies and use shield_wall facing North (toward the enemy cluster to the northeast).
  State: Aegis 11/11, Hawk 4/4, Lifeline 9/9, Shade 4/4, Deadeye 4/4, Pulse 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Lifeline (enemy medic) is at (3,3) facing N, and I'm already behind them. I can move to (3,2) which is directly behind Lifeline and adjacent — perfect for breach. Breaching the medic will make them obey me next turn, effectively neutralizing their healing. This is the highest-value play.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward (0,0) corner and away from allies. I'm at (3,3). Valid moves include (2,2) and (2,3) and (2,4). Moving to (2,2) gets me closest to (0,0) and away from the enemy cluster at (3,2)/(4,3). Then I can move again to (1,1) or similar — but I only get one move action. Best single move toward (0,0) is (2,2).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is a specter at dist=3, in range for precision_shot. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. Orders say medics first, but only Shade is in range. Shade is a high-value target (specter). I should precision_shot Shade now. No need to move first — shooting from current position works fine, and moving might reduce damage to 1dmg. Stay put and fire.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(3,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded at HP 2/4 and located at (3,2), distance 3 from me at (4,4). I need to close the gap. Moving to (3,3) puts me at distance 1 from Shade (adjacent), allowing me to use patch. Deadeye is at full HP so no heal needed there. Priority: move toward Shade then patch.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with full HP. Two enemies in range: Aegis (sentinel) at (4,0) dist=3 and Lifeline (medic) at (2,2) dist=3. No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive gives +1 range. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is available. Lifeline is the medic - killing or pressuring the medic is high priority to deny healing. Both are healthy so no wounded to finish off. I'll precision_shot Lifeline (2dmg) without moving to maintain high ground bonus and avoid the 1dmg penalty. No move needed - current position already has both targets in range.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Enemies are clustered at (3,2), (4,3), (3,3) - all dist 3+. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (4,2) closes distance to Deadeye to 1 and Shade to 1, putting me adjacent to the enemy cluster. From (4,2) I can use shield_wall facing N to protect allies Hawk and Lifeline from the enemy cluster above. This advances me while setting up a defensive screen.
  State: Aegis 11/11, Hawk 4/4, Lifeline 7/9, Shade 4/4, Deadeye 4/4, Pulse 9/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked and adjacent to both Aegis and Lifeline. Priority: eliminate the enemy medic Lifeline before they can heal. I can move to (2,3) to get behind Lifeline (facing S, so behind is N side = (2,3)), then use shadow_strike to deal 2 damage while keeping cloak. Shadow_strike keeps cloak so I stay invisible after. Moving to (2,3) puts me behind Lifeline and adjacent for shadow_strike.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is at dist=3, exactly in range for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved yet so no penalty. Medics are priority but Pulse is out of range. Shade is a specter — dangerous, already acted this round. I can shoot Shade now, then move away to maintain distance. Moving to (0,2) keeps distance from Shade and preserves High Ground passive.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward corner (0,0) and away from allies. From (2,2), I can move to (1,1) which gets me closer to (0,0). Then move again to... wait, I only get one move per turn. Best single move toward (0,0) from valid tiles is (1,1).
- **Pulse** (medic): patch(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is at (2,3) with 2/4 HP and needs healing. I'm at (3,3). I need to move adjacent to Shade to use patch. Moving to (2,3) would overlap — I should move to (2,4) or (2,2) or stay and check if (2,3) is adjacent to me. Distance from (3,3) to (2,3) is 1 — Shade is already adjacent! I can patch Shade from my current position without moving.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (4,2) — this blocks precision_shot. I can't use precision_shot while adjacent to an enemy. Wounded Lifeline and Hawk are both out of range at dist=5. Best play: move away from Aegis to break adjacency, then use precision_shot on Aegis from range. Moving to (5,3) puts me 2 tiles from Aegis (dist=2, within range 2 after nerf), breaking adjacency. But wait — my range is 3, and High Ground passive gives +1 if no adjacent enemy, so moving to (5,3) would make Aegis at dist=2, which is within range 3. Use precision_shot on Aegis after moving.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) N ✓
  💭 Enemies are clustered at (2,3), (3,3), (5,3) — all to the north. I'm fortified but orders say push forward aggressively. Move to (4,4) to close distance with Deadeye at (5,3) and the cluster. Then shield_wall facing North to protect against the enemy cluster above.
  State: Aegis 10/11, Hawk 4/4, Lifeline 5/9, Shade 4/4, Deadeye 4/4, Pulse 9/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → breach(1,1) ✓
  💭 Lifeline (enemy medic) is wounded and I can get behind her. Position [1,2] is behind Lifeline (facing S) and reachable in my move range. Move to [1,2] first, then breach Lifeline — she'll be adjacent and I'm behind her. This wastes her next turn and denies healing to Hawk. Breach cooldown is ready and I have 1 use left.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → overclock(5,3) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Deadeye is my damage dealer at (5,3), dist=2. I should move adjacent to Deadeye and use overclock to give them 2 abilities next turn. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Deadeye at (5,3) and closer to the action. Aegis sentinel is at (4,4) which would be adjacent to (4,3) - that's an enemy, so overclock would be blocked if Aegis is adjacent to me. Wait - the block is for patch/overclock when adjacent to enemy Vector, not sentinel. Actually re-reading: blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Aegis is a sentinel, not a Vector class. So overclock should work. Move to (4,3) to be adjacent to Deadeye, then overclock Deadeye.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(0,4) ✓ → suppressing_fire(1,2) S ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (1,2) — this blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Valid moves: (0,0),(0,1),(0,3),(0,4),(1,3),(2,2). Moving to (0,4) puts me 2 tiles from Shade, out of adjacency, and opens up precision_shot. But Shade is a specter — low priority vs medics. After moving, check range: Deadeye and Pulse are still out of range. Best play: move to (2,2) to get distance from Shade while potentially getting angle, then suppressing_fire on Shade to slow it since I can't reach medics. Actually Shade is still 2 tiles from (2,2) — not adjacent, so precision_shot is available but only vs Shade. Orders say medics first, but they're out of range. Use suppressing_fire on Shade to slow it and create distance.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team and toward the edge. I'm at (1,1). Edge tiles from valid moves: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) are on the west edge. Moving to (0,0) gets me to the corner, furthest from allies at (4,4) and (0,4). Then I'll wait.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Aegis is at (4,4), dist=2, within my range 3. I'm at (5,3) not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is available. Use both ability charges on precision_shot targeting Aegis for 2+2=4 damage to eliminate the healthy sentinel. No movement needed.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is right next to me at (4,3), distance 1 — I can attack immediately. Deadeye is at (5,3) distance 2, just out of melee. If I attack Pulse first, then move to (5,4), I'd be adjacent to Deadeye for a follow-up — but I only get one ability. Better: attack Pulse now (free damage on the medic), stay put to keep Fortify active for 50% damage reduction. Staying fortified is very strong since I'm at 8/11 HP and surrounded by enemies.
  State: Aegis 8/11, Hawk 4/4, Lifeline 5/9, Shade 3/4, Deadeye 3/4, Pulse 8/9

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Suppressed so only 1 tile movement. No enemies in range. Breach unavailable. Lifeline is wounded at (0,0) facing S — their back is at (0,1). I can't reach (0,1) in one move from (1,2), but moving to (1,1) gets me closer. From (1,1) next turn I could reach (0,1) to get behind Lifeline. Hawk is at (0,4) which is far. Moving toward Lifeline is best — move to (1,1) to close distance.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is at dist=2, within precision_shot range (≤3). I'm at 3/4 HP so staying safe matters. I'm not adjacent to Aegis (dist=2), so precision_shot is not blocked. No need to move — fire precision_shot on Aegis for 2 damage. Then wait or hold position.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team and toward the edge. I'm at (0,0) which is already a corner. Valid moves are (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0). Hawk is at (0,4) to the north, so moving south along x=0 would be away from team. (1,0) and (2,0) move east along the bottom edge. Moving to (2,0) gets me furthest from Hawk at (0,4) while staying on the edge.
- **Pulse** (medic): patch(5,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is adjacent at (5,3) with 3/4 HP and needs a heal. I have 1 patch remaining. Aegis is at (4,4) dist=1, but patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy - wait, the warning says patch/overclock blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not sentinel. Aegis is a sentinel, not a Vector. So patch should still work. I'll heal Deadeye at (5,3). I'm currently at (4,3), Deadeye is at (5,3) which is adjacent. I can patch Deadeye first, then consider positioning. Aegis is nearby but is a sentinel not a Vector, so no blocking. Heal Deadeye with my last patch, then move to stay useful.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest threat is Shade at dist 4 (need ≤3 for precision_shot with High Ground bonus giving rng 3+1=4... but only if no adjacent enemy). Orders say prioritize medics. Pulse is at (5,4) dist 5, too far. Need to reposition to bring targets in range while maintaining distance from Shade at (1,1). Moving to (2,4) keeps me away from Shade and brings Pulse closer (dist would be 3 tiles away). Let me check: from (2,4) to Pulse at (5,4) = 3 tiles east, that's range 3, plus High Ground = 4 if no adjacent enemy. Actually base range is 3, so dist 3 is within range. Move to (2,4) to get Pulse in range for precision_shot.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,3) E ✓
  💭 Pulse is adjacent at (5,4) — attack it. I'm fortified so losing that bonus hurts, but orders say push forward and attack. After attacking Pulse, I can shield_wall facing East to protect against Deadeye at (5,3) who is just out of melee range. Staying put preserves fortify if I only use ability, but orders say push forward aggressively. I'll attack Pulse first (no move needed, already in range), then shield_wall East to block Deadeye's likely shot.
  State: Aegis 7/11, Hawk 4/4, Lifeline 5/9, Shade 3/4, Deadeye 4/4, Pulse 6/9

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,0) ✓
  💭 Lifeline (enemy medic) is wounded and only dist=2 away. I can move to (1,0) which is behind Lifeline and adjacent, then shadow_strike for 2 damage while staying cloaked. This could finish off the wounded medic. Breach is unavailable so shadow_strike is the play.
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Shade is wounded but far away (dist=8). Deadeye is adjacent at (5,3) with full HP, so no heal needed. Aegis (sentinel) is right next to me at (4,4), dist=1. I can't patch anyone useful. Best play: overclock Deadeye to boost our damage dealer, then stay in position. Deadeye is at (5,3), which is adjacent to me at (5,4).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse (medic) is in range at dist=3 from current position. Orders say medics first. I can precision_shot Pulse for 2 damage without moving (no movement = full damage). Deadeye is out of range at dist=4. After shooting, I should hold position or reposition to maintain distance from Shade approaching from (1,0).
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team and toward the edge. I'm at (2,0). Valid moves include (4,0) which is toward the right edge and away from my team clustered around (2,4)-(4,4). Moving to (4,0) maximizes distance from allies. Shade is adjacent at (1,0) but orders are clear - move away. I have no ability to use that helps here, so just move.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 I have OVERCLOCKED status giving me 2 ability uses. Aegis is in range at dist=2, healthy. Hawk and Lifeline are out of range at dist=4. I can't reach Lifeline (wounded) without moving, but if I move toward them I lose position. At current position (5,3), Aegis is at (4,4) dist=2 - within precision_shot range (≤3). No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive gives +1 range. I'm not adjacent to Aegis so precision_shot is not blocked. Use both ability charges on precision_shot against Aegis to deal 4 damage total and eliminate the healthy sentinel.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) E ✓
  💭 Pulse is adjacent and wounded — attack to finish them. I'm fortified and at half HP, so staying put preserves my damage reduction. Deadeye is at dist=2, not adjacent, so I can't attack them. Attacking Pulse is the priority, then shield_wall facing East to protect against Deadeye.
  State: Aegis 5/11, Hawk 4/4, Lifeline 3/9, Shade 3/4, Deadeye 3/4, Pulse 3/9

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,0) ✓
  💭 Lifeline (enemy medic) is wounded and only 3 tiles away. I can reach position (3,0) which is directly behind Lifeline — breach is unavailable but I can shadow_strike from adjacent while cloaked. Wait, I'm not cloaked. But I can move to (3,0) which is adjacent to Lifeline at (4,0), then shadow_strike for 2 damage. Lifeline is wounded so this could finish or severely weaken them. Moving to (3,0) first, then shadow_strike.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse (medic) is in range at dist=3 and wounded — priority target per orders. I'm at (2,4) with no adjacent enemies, so precision_shot is available (2dmg). Shooting first, then staying put maintains distance from Shade and Deadeye.
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(5,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals left. Deadeye is adjacent at (5,3) and wounded. I can't patch (0 uses). I could overclock Deadeye to boost damage output. Aegis is adjacent at (4,4) - I could attack but at 1HP I'm very vulnerable. Best play: overclock Deadeye to maximize damage on remaining enemies, then attack Aegis to help finish it.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 I have 2 ability uses this turn (overclocked) and Aegis is wounded at dist=2 and in range. Precision_shot does 2dmg at range≤3 and I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so it's not blocked. Use precision_shot twice on Aegis to finish them off.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/9 HP — critically wounded and adjacent to Shade (enemy specter). I must flee immediately. Shade is at (3,0), so I should move away. Valid moves include (5,0) or (5,1) to increase distance. Moving to (5,1) puts me at dist=3 from Shade and gets me slightly closer to Aegis who needs healing. I can't heal Aegis this turn (dist=4, not adjacent). I'll move to (5,1) to escape, then wait — no adjacent allies to heal or overclock.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) E ✓
  💭 Pulse is adjacent and critical — attack to finish them off. I'm at 2HP so staying fortified is valuable, but I can attack without moving and keep fortify. Attack Pulse first, then shield_wall facing E to block Deadeye.
  State: Aegis 2/11, Hawk 4/4, Lifeline 1/9, Shade 3/4, Deadeye 2/4 | Dead: Pulse

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,1) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is critical and reachable. I can move to (5,0) which is behind Lifeline at (5,1) and adjacent. Then shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked. This finishes or nearly finishes a critical medic.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is critical and adjacent (dist=2), within precision_shot range. I'm at 2HP so survival matters. I'm not adjacent to Aegis so precision_shot isn't blocked. Fire precision_shot at Aegis to finish them off. Then wait or reposition.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Deadeye is at dist=4, so I need to close to range 3. Moving to (3,4) gets me 1 tile closer, but Deadeye is still at dist=3 from (3,4) — wait, Deadeye is at (5,3), dist from (3,4) = |5-3|+|3-4| = 2+1 = 3, which is in range. Move to (3,4) then use precision_shot on Deadeye.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically low. Deadeye is at dist=2 and I have no enemies in range. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Deadeye at (5,3) for a melee attack. But at 1HP I'll likely die next turn. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move to (5,4) to get adjacent to Deadeye, then attack. Shield_wall facing E toward enemy cluster won't help since I need to attack. Let's move to (5,4) and attack Deadeye.
  State: Aegis 1/11, Hawk 4/4, Shade 3/4 | Dead: Lifeline, Deadeye, Pulse

### Turn 9 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Aegis is at (5,4) distance 4, Hawk at (3,4) distance 6. I can move up to 3 tiles. Best move is toward Aegis (critical HP) to close distance. Moving to (5,3) puts me distance 1 from Aegis. Then shadow_strike Aegis for 2 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is at (5,3), distance 3 — exactly at max range. I'm healthy at 4/4 HP. Orders say precision_shot high-value targets. Shade is a specter (damage dealer), so it qualifies. I haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals full 2 damage. I should fire first, then consider repositioning to maintain distance and keep high ground bonus.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Shade 1/4 | Dead: Aegis, Lifeline, Deadeye, Pulse

## Result
