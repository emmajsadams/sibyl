## Squads
### Player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Pulse** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
### Opponent
- **Longshot** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot enemy is in scan range at dist=3. Scan to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. Then move south to increase distance from enemies.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,0) ✓ → patch(4,1) ✓
  💭 Longshot ally is wounded at (4,1) with 4/5 HP. I need to move adjacent to them to heal. From (3,0), I can move to (4,0) which is distance 1 from (4,1) — adjacent. Then patch them for 2HP. Enemies are all far away (5-7 dist), so no immediate threat. Moving to (4,0) keeps me near the striker while staying safe.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (closest is Insight at dist=5, my max range is 2). I should advance northward to close distance. Moving to (4,3) gets me 2 tiles closer to Insight at (3,5), putting them at dist=3 - still out of range but better positioned. No enemies in range so no ability this turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest enemies are Longshot and Bastion at dist=5. My range is 2, so I need to close distance. Orders say stay at max range (2 tiles). Moving toward Longshot at (4,3) - best I can reach is (2,4) which is still dist=3 from Longshot. From valid moves, (2,4) gets me closer. Actually let me check: from (1,3) dist to Longshot(4,3) = 3, still out of range. From (2,4) dist to Longshot = sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, still out. No position within mv2 puts me in range of any enemy. I'll advance toward Longshot as best I can while staying safe.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 4, out of melee range. Push forward toward the enemy cluster. Bastion is at (2,1) directly south, Longshot at (4,3). Move to (2,3) to advance toward Bastion and close distance. Then shield_wall facing S toward the approaching threats.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis enemy sentinel is 2 tiles north at (2,3). I should advance to (2,2) to get adjacent and attack. Moving north puts me between allies and enemies, fulfilling hold-the-line orders. After moving to (2,2), Aegis at (2,3) will be adjacent, so I can attack.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Bastion 11/11, Pulse 11/11, Aegis 10/11, Longshot 5/5, Insight 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → scan(2,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is already scanned. Bastion is at dist=4 but the range check shows inRange=false, so I can't scan it from here. I should move to get Bastion in scan range (≤4 tiles). Moving to (2,5) puts me at dist=3 from Bastion at (2,2), bringing it into scan range. Then scan Bastion to reveal its prompt.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → patch(2,2) ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel) at (2,2) is wounded at 10/11 HP and is the priority heal target. I'm at (4,0) with speed 3. I need to get adjacent to Bastion to use patch. Bastion is at (2,2), so adjacent tiles would be (1,2),(3,2),(2,1),(2,3). I can reach (3,2) in one move (dist=2, within mv3). From (3,2) I'd be adjacent to Bastion at (2,2). Then I can patch Bastion. This keeps me behind friendly lines and away from enemies.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis sentinel is at dist=2, within precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet so no penalty. Fire precision_shot on Aegis for 2dmg. Then move to (5,3) to reposition east, maintaining distance from enemies clustering at x=2.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic (Pulse) per orders. Pulse is at (3,2), dist=3 which is within my range of 2... wait, range is ≤2 tiles. Dist=3 is out of range. Bastion is at (2,2), dist=2, in range. Pulse at dist=3 is out of range for precision_shot (max range 2). I need to move closer to hit Pulse, but I must not go adjacent. Moving to (3,3) puts me dist=1 from Bastion (adjacent - forbidden) and dist=1 from Pulse. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Pulse: dist from (4,4) to (3,2) = |4-3|+|4-2| = 1+2 = 3, still out of range. Moving to (3,4): dist to Pulse (3,2) = |3-3|+|4-2| = 0+2 = 2, in range! And dist to Bastion (2,2) = |3-2|+|4-2| = 1+2 = 3, not adjacent. Good. I haven't moved so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Target Pulse the medic at (3,2) from (3,4).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,2) — attack it. I'm already fortified and didn't move last turn, so I want to preserve fortify by not moving. Stay put, attack Bastion, then shield_wall facing South to block incoming from the enemy cluster below.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) to my north. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and haven't moved. I should attack Aegis to deal damage while maintaining fortify. If I move, I lose fortify. Better to stay put, attack the adjacent sentinel, then wait or use shield_wall to protect allies. Attack first, then shield_wall north to block incoming threats from Aegis/Longshot/Insight.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Bastion 10/11, Pulse 10/11, Aegis 8/11, Longshot 5/5, Insight 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse at (3,2) is in scan range (dist=4) and not yet scanned. I should scan Pulse to reveal its prompt. I'm currently at (2,5). Pulse is at dist=4 which is exactly at scan range limit. I can scan Pulse without moving. Bastion is already scanned. Longshot is out of range at dist=5. After scanning Pulse, I have no other useful action - wait or reposition. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to Pulse while staying safe.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → patch(2,2) ✓
  💭 Bastion at (2,2) is wounded (10/11 HP). I need to get adjacent to heal. I'm at (3,2), so moving to (2,2) would put me on top of Bastion - not valid. I should move to (2,1) or (1,2) to be adjacent to Bastion at (2,2). Wait - (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) and in my valid moves. But I also need to check if enemies are adjacent to my destination that would block patch. Aegis is at (2,3). If I move to (2,1), Aegis at (2,3) is dist=2, not adjacent, so patch is not blocked. From (2,1), Bastion at (2,2) is adjacent - I can heal. Let me move to (2,1) then patch Bastion.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic Pulse. However, Pulse is at distance 4 and out of range from my current position (3,4). I need to move closer. Moving to (4,3) would put me at distance 3 from Pulse at (2,1)... let me check: |4-2|+|3-1|=2+2=4, still out of range. Moving to (5,4): |5-2|+|4-1|=3+3=6, worse. Moving to (3,3): |3-2|+|3-1|=1+2=3, that's within range 2? No, precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Pulse is at dist 4 minimum. I can't reach Pulse this turn. Fall back to targeting healthy enemies in range - Longshot at (5,3) dist 3 is in range (recon says inRange:true), Bastion at (2,2) dist 3 also in range. Both healthy. I'll precision_shot Longshot since it's the enemy DPS threat. I'm not adjacent to enemies so precision_shot is valid. I'll stay at current position and fire.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both Aegis and Longshot are at dist=3, which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). Wait — dist=3 exceeds range 2. I need to check: precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, but both targets are at dist=3. So neither is in precision_shot range. I should move closer to one target to get within range 2, then fire. Longshot is a priority threat (striker). Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist ~2 from Longshot at (3,4) — that's exactly 1 tile away in x + 0 in y... wait, (4,4) to (3,4) is dist=1, within range. Or move to (4,3) which is dist=1 from (3,4) via x+y = 1+1=2, still in range 2. I'll move to (4,4) to get adjacent distance 1 from Longshot and fire precision_shot. But precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy — dist=1 is adjacent. Better: move to (4,3), dist to Longshot(3,4) = 1+1=2, within range and not adjacent. Then precision_shot Longshot for 2 dmg.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with Bastion adjacent at (2,2). I can attack Bastion now while fortified for bonus defense, then shield_wall facing south to block the medic's approach or facing the enemy cluster. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Bastion is adjacent — attack it. Then shield_wall facing S to protect against Pulse at (2,1) advancing.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction and Aegis is adjacent to the north. Attacking Aegis is the priority while maintaining fortify by not moving. I'll use shield_wall facing north to protect allies from Aegis and the threats beyond, then attack Aegis. Actually, attacking deals damage and shield_wall is defensive. Since I'm fortified (didn't move last turn) and Aegis is right there at (2,3), I should attack Aegis first. Then use shield_wall facing N to block damage from the northern enemies toward my allies. But if I attack first that uses my ability slot. I can only use one ability per turn. Best play: stay put to keep fortify, attack adjacent Aegis for damage, and forgo shield_wall this turn since attacking is more impactful.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Bastion 10/11, Pulse 9/11, Aegis 7/11, Longshot 4/5, Insight 6/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — prompts known. Bastion is at (2,2), dist 3, in scan range. But scan is most valuable for unknowns; all enemies revealed. Foresight shows Longshot(E) did precision_shot on our striker at (3,4) last turn — striker may be wounded. Pulse is moving to heal Bastion. Priority: I should recalibrate our striker who just got hit, or scan isn't needed. Actually, let me check: striker(A) is listed as healthy still. Bastion attacked (2,3) where our sentinel is — sentinel still healthy. No new targets to scan. Best action: move closer to recalibrate our striker at (3,4) — I need to be adjacent. From (2,5), I can move to (3,5) which is adjacent to striker at (3,4). Then recalibrate striker to press the attack on wounded enemies.
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bastion is wounded at (2,2) adjacent to me at (2,1). I could overclock Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn, which is valuable since Aegis enemy is at (2,3) — Bastion can act twice against them. However overclock costs me 1HP (going to 8/11) and Bastion is already wounded. The enemy Aegis sentinel is at dist=2 from me, so I'm not adjacent to enemies — overclock is not blocked. Using overclock on Bastion at (2,2) is worthwhile since Bastion can double-action against the adjacent enemy Aegis. I'll overclock Bastion first, then wait (or I could move away slightly). Actually I should stay near Bastion for support. I'll overclock Bastion and wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot at (4,3) is dist=2, in range, no shield. I'm at full HP but orders say focus Longshot with precision_shot. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. I should not move adjacent to enemies. Staying at (3,4) keeps dist=2 from Longshot. Fire precision_shot on Longshot, then wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 3/5 HP. Longshot (striker) at (3,4) is distance 2 and in range. Aegis (sentinel) at (2,3) is also distance 2. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2 damage. Longshot is the priority target - killing or wounding a striker reduces their damage output. I'll use precision_shot on Longshot at (3,4), then move to (5,3) to create distance from threats and maintain range advantage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with Bastion adjacent at (2,2). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Bastion is healthy and right below me — attack it. Then shield_wall south to protect against Pulse at (2,1) and the enemy cluster below. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm Bastion (sentinel) at (2,2) with Fortify active (50% dmg reduction) and Overclocked (2 ability uses). Aegis enemy sentinel is adjacent at (2,3) to my north. I should attack Aegis twice with both ability uses. Staying in place preserves Fortify. No need to move — enemy is right here and I'm holding the front line between allies at (2,1) and enemies to the north.
  State: Longshot 3/5, Bastion 8/11, Pulse 9/11, Aegis 5/11, Longshot 2/5, Insight 6/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned. Foresight shows enemy Longshot will precision_shot at (3,4) where our wounded striker is — that's dangerous. I should recalibrate our wounded striker at (3,4) to help them survive. I'm currently at (3,5), and recalibrate requires adjacent target. (3,4) is adjacent to me (1 tile south). So I can recalibrate the striker directly without moving. After recalibrating, I have no scan targets left (all scanned) and can't attack anyone usefully from here. I'll wait as second action.
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bastion at (2,2) is adjacent to me and wounded at 8/11 HP. I can use overclock on Bastion to give them an extra action - they're a sentinel so extra actions are valuable. I should also consider positioning. Moving to (2,2) would put me adjacent to Bastion but also closer to enemy Aegis at (2,3). Better to stay near Bastion and use overclock. Bastion is at (2,2), I'm at (2,1) - we are adjacent. I'll overclock Bastion then wait, or move to a safer position after.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Two wounded enemies in range: Aegis (sentinel) and Longshot (striker). I'm at (5,3) with 3HP. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Longshot is wounded - if at low HP, a 2dmg shot could finish them. Priority is killing wounded enemies. I'll use precision_shot on Longshot first, then if I can use a second ability I can't - only one ability per turn. So: precision_shot Longshot to potentially kill, no move needed to keep full damage.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP, wounded. Enemy Longshot at (5,3) is also wounded and will shoot me this turn. Priority: move to break LoS or reposition, then precision_shot Longshot to finish it. Moving to (4,5) increases distance and changes angle. From (4,5), dist to Longshot at (5,3) = sqrt(1+4)=~2.24, within range 2? No, range is ≤2 tiles Manhattan: |4-5|+|5-3|=1+2=3, still out of range 2. Moving to (4,4): dist to Longshot = |4-5|+|4-3|=1+1=2, exactly range 2, can precision_shot. But I need to not be adjacent to enemies - Bastion is at (2,2), far away. From (4,4) I can precision_shot Longshot at (5,3). But if Longshot shoots me first this turn, I need to survive. Current position (3,4) dist to Longshot=3, outside their range 2. Wait - Longshot range is 2, Longshot at (5,3), dist to me at (3,4)=|5-3|+|3-4|=2+1=3. They can't reach me! So I'm safe here. I can precision_shot from (3,4): dist to Longshot=3, that's >2, out of MY range too. I need to move closer. Move to (4,4): within range 2 of Longshot, can precision_shot for 2dmg. I haven't moved yet so no penalty. (4,4) is valid move. This should kill wounded Longshot.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) N ✓
  💭 I'm Bastion (sentinel) at (2,2), fortified with 50% damage reduction and OVERCLOCKED for 2 ability uses. Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (2,3) to my north - wounded and in melee range. My ally Pulse (medic) is at (2,1) to my south. I should attack Aegis since they're adjacent and wounded, then use shield_wall facing north to protect against further threats from that direction. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 4HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Bastion is adjacent at (2,2) — I can attack it. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. If I move I lose fortify, so staying put to keep the damage reduction and attack Bastion is optimal. Shield_wall facing S would protect against Pulse at (2,1), but attacking Bastion deals damage and follows orders. Attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing S to block Pulse's approach.
  State: Longshot 2/5, Bastion 6/11, Pulse 9/11, Aegis 4/11, Longshot 2/5, Insight 6/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 No heals remaining, so patch is unavailable. Bastion is adjacent at (2,2) with 6/11 HP - I could overclock them to give an extra action, which is valuable for a sentinel. I'm at (2,1), Bastion is at (2,2) which is adjacent. Enemy Aegis is at (2,3), distance 2 from me. If I stay at (2,1) I can overclock Bastion. However, overclock requires not being adjacent to an enemy - Aegis is at dist 2 from me so not adjacent, should be fine. Overclock Bastion for the extra action benefit, then wait or reposition. I'll overclock Bastion first, then move to a safer position.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → recalibrate(2,3) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned. Longshot at (5,3) is dist 4 from current pos (3,5) — just barely out of range. I can move to (4,5) to get closer, then scan or attack isn't available adjacently. Wait — scan needs target within 4 tiles. From (4,5), Longshot at (5,3) is dist 3 — in range. But Longshot is already scanned. Bastion at (2,2) from (4,5) is dist 5 — no. Actually all enemies are already scanned. I should recalibrate wounded allies. Aegis sentinel at (2,3) is wounded. From (3,5), Aegis is dist 3 — not adjacent. I need to move adjacent to Aegis. (2,3) adjacent tiles: (1,3),(3,3),(2,4),(2,2). From valid moves, (3,3) and (2,4) are available. Move to (3,4) — adjacent to Aegis at (2,3)? Dist from (3,4) to (2,3) = 2 — not adjacent. Move to (2,4) — adjacent to (2,3)? Yes, dist=1. (2,4) is in valid moves. Then recalibrate Aegis at (2,3) with a buff addendum. Aegis is wounded and acting last, so buffing them helps. Or recalibrate Longshot striker at (4,4) who is also wounded — from (2,4) dist to (4,4) is 4, not adjacent. So move to (2,4) and recalibrate Aegis sentinel.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot striker at (4,4) is wounded and only dist=2 away - priority target. I'm at (5,3) with 2HP so I need to be careful. I can use precision_shot on Longshot (dist=2, in range, wounded) without moving first to avoid the 1dmg penalty. This could finish them off. Then I should reposition to avoid being adjacent to threats.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) to my north. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and overclocked (2 ability uses). I should attack Aegis twice to press the advantage while fortified. No need to move — staying put keeps fortify active and keeps me between allies and enemies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 2HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Bastion is adjacent at (2,2) to my south. Orders say hold position south-facing, attack Bastion, prioritize survival. I should NOT move to keep fortify active. Attack Bastion at (2,2), then shield_wall facing south to block incoming attacks.
  State: Longshot 2/5, Bastion 4/11, Pulse 9/11, Aegis 2/11, Insight 6/6 | Dead: Longshot

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies already scanned. Aegis is critical and was attacked twice by Bastion last turn. I should recalibrate Aegis to help them survive. Aegis is adjacent at (2,3). After recalibrating, I can move to maintain distance from Bastion at (2,2) who poses a threat. Moving to (3,4) keeps me safe while staying useful.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → overclock(2,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Longshot is critically low at 2/5 HP but dist=5, unreachable. Bastion is wounded at 4/11 HP, dist=2 — I can reach adjacent to Bastion. Aegis (enemy sentinel) is at (2,3), dist=3 from me. Moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (2,2) and dist=2 from Aegis — risky. Moving to (1,2) or (2,1) to get adjacent to Bastion. Since patch is gone, I should use overclock on Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn — Bastion is a sentinel which can use extra actions defensively/offensively. I'll move to (2,1) to be adjacent to Bastion at (2,2), then overclock Bastion. But wait — overclock requires checking if I'm adjacent to enemy: Aegis is at (2,3), from (2,1) that's dist=2, not adjacent, so overclock is not blocked. Let me move to (2,1) and overclock Bastion at (2,2).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close distance. Aegis is critical - priority target. Moving to (3,2) brings me closer but still dist 2 from Aegis at (2,3) - that's within range 2 (Manhattan dist=2). Let me verify: from (3,2) to (2,3) = |3-2|+|2-3|=1+1=2, in range. I can move to (3,2) then precision_shot Aegis. But I moved, so precision_shot deals 1dmg. Aegis is critical so 1dmg should finish them. Also check LoS - no obstacles mentioned, should be clear. Not adjacent to Aegis so precision_shot not blocked.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1 HP — critical. Bastion is adjacent at (2,2) and will attack me this turn. I must survive. Fortify gives 50% damage reduction if I don't move. Bastion deals 1 dmg; with fortify that rounds to 0 or 1. If I hold and use shield_wall facing S (toward Bastion at (2,2) which is directly south of me), I block damage to adjacent allies from that direction — but shield_wall blocks damage TO allies, not to myself. So shield_wall won't protect me directly. Best option: attack Bastion first (it's adjacent, wounded — might kill it), then wait to keep fortify active. Attacking doesn't require moving. If Bastion dies, the immediate threat is gone. Use ability (attack Bastion) then wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✗ No unit at target
  💭 I'm at critical HP (2/11) but fortified (50% dmg reduction) and overclocked (2 ability uses). Aegis is adjacent at (2,3) and critical - I should attack to finish them off. I have 2 ability uses so I can attack twice. Staying in place preserves fortify bonus. No need to move.
  State: Longshot 2/5, Bastion 2/11, Pulse 9/11, Insight 6/6 | Dead: Aegis, Longshot

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(2,1) ✓
  💭 Both Longshot and Bastion are already scanned. Bastion is critical — I should scan Pulse since it's just at range 4 from current position, but recon shows Pulse is out of range (dist:4, inRange:false). All three enemies are scanned already. Best use of this turn: move to get better positioning and scan Pulse if possible, or recalibrate an ally. Foresight shows Pulse used overclock on Bastion last turn. Bastion is critical and attacked (2,3) twice — likely targeting Insight who moved there. I can scan Pulse by moving closer. From (3,4), Pulse is at (2,1), dist=4 but marked inRange:false — so scan would fail. Move to (2,3) would put me at dist=2 from Pulse and in range. But (2,3) is where Bastion attacked and Longshot used precision_shot — dangerous. Move to (3,3) puts me dist=3 from Pulse, within scan range. From (3,3): Pulse at (2,1) = dist = sqrt(1+4) = ~2.2, so dist=3 manhattan = 2, inRange. Actually manhattan from (3,3) to (2,1) = 1+2=3, within scan range 4. I'll move to (3,3) then scan Pulse.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch unavailable (0 uses left). Bastion is adjacent at (2,2) with 2/11 HP - critically wounded. I can use overclock on Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn, which helps them act more. Bastion at (2,2) is adjacent to me at (2,1). Overclock costs Bastion 1 HP but gives 2 abilities - risky at 2HP. Better to position safely. I'll move toward Bastion to stay adjacent and use overclock to maximize Bastion's output since I can't heal. Actually overclock costs the TARGET 1 dmg, so Bastion at 2HP would go to 1HP - very risky. But Longshot at 2/5 HP is not adjacent (dist=2). I should move to (2,2) is occupied by Bastion. Let me move to (1,2) to stay near Bastion and be safely behind them, then wait since overclock on a 2HP ally is too risky.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 Insight is adjacent at (3,3), which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first to use precision_shot. Move to (4,2) to create distance (dist=2 from Insight at 3,3: sqrt(1+1)=1.4, actually dist=2 manhattan), then precision_shot Insight. Wait - (4,2) to (3,3) is dist=sqrt(1+1)≈1.4, still within range 2. But I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg. Alternatively move to (3,1) - dist from (3,1) to (3,3)=2, not adjacent, precision_shot for 1dmg (moved). Or move to (5,2) - dist to (3,3)=sqrt(4+1)≈2.2, out of range. Best: move to (4,3) - dist to (3,3)=sqrt(1+0)=1, still adjacent. Move to (3,1): not adjacent to Insight, can use precision_shot for 1dmg (moved). Actually at 2HP I should retreat and still deal damage. Move to (3,1), then precision_shot Insight at (3,3) for 1dmg (reduced due to moving).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,1) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/11 HP and fortified (50% damage reduction). Insight is at (3,3), distance 2 — not adjacent, can't attack. Moving would break Fortify. Longshot is wounded at (3,1) and Pulse is healthy at (1,2). Best play is to stay put, maintain Fortify, and use shield_wall to protect Longshot from the north threat (Insight is at (3,3), south of Longshot would be... Insight is NE of me). I should shield_wall toward E or N to cover allies from Insight's direction. Longshot is at (3,1) which is to my SE — shield_wall targeting Longshot with direction N would block damage coming from the north. Actually Insight is at (3,3) which is north of Longshot at (3,1). So I shield_wall on Longshot targeting N to block incoming from Insight.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bastion is adjacent at (2,2) with 2/11 HP - critically wounded. I can use overclock on Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could be very valuable for a sentinel. I'm at (1,2), Bastion is at (2,2) - that's adjacent. Overclock will cost me 1 HP but Bastion gets 2 actions next turn. This is the best support I can provide since I can't heal.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(2,2) ✓
  💭 All three visible enemies already scanned — prompts known. Foresight shows Longshot will precision_shot me at (3,3) this turn, dealing damage. I should move to avoid that shot. Moving to (4,4) gets me out of Longshot's current position line and keeps all enemies in scan range. After moving, I can scan Pulse (already scanned but at dist 3, all are known). Actually all prompts are known. I should use scan to deal 1 damage to a wounded/critical enemy. Longshot is wounded at dist 2, Bastion is critical at dist 2. Scanning Bastion (critical) could finish them or weaken further. But first I must move to avoid Longshot's precision_shot targeting (3,3). Moving to (4,4) then scanning Bastion at dist ~2.8 which is ≤4.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 Insight is at (4,4), distance 4 - out of my range 2. I need to close distance. Moving to (4,2) gets me distance 2 from Insight, putting them in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot will deal full 2 damage.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Longshot is wounded at 2/5 HP but is 3 tiles away - not adjacent, so I can't heal or overclock them anyway. No enemies are in range. I should move toward Longshot to try to close the distance and support next turn, or position safely. Moving toward (4,1) gets me closer to Longshot at (4,2) while staying away from the enemy oracle at (4,4).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Longshot will precision_shot at (4,4) — my current position. I need to move away. Longshot is wounded and already scanned. I should move to dodge the incoming shot, then scan or attack. Moving to (5,5) gets me out of (4,4) but Longshot targets (4,4) so any move works. Both enemies are already scanned, so scan isn't needed. I'm at 4HP and Longshot will shoot me. Move first to avoid the shot, then attack Longshot who is wounded at range 2 — but attack only works adjacent. I can't reach (4,2) in one move (distance 2, mv3 so I could). Wait — I have mv3. From (4,4) I can move to (4,3) which is distance 1 from Longshot at (4,2), putting me adjacent. Then attack for 1dmg to finish off the wounded Longshot. But Longshot moves to (4,2) first then shoots (4,4). If I move first before Longshot acts... turn order shows Pulse goes first, then me (Insight), then Longshot. So I act BEFORE Longshot shoots. I should move off (4,4) to dodge, and also try to damage Longshot. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,2) — attack deals 1dmg. Longshot is wounded so this could finish them. Move to (4,3), then attack Longshot at (4,2).
- **Longshot** (striker): suppressing_fire(4,3) N ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 1HP, adjacent to Insight at (4,3). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I should move away to get range, then use precision_shot. Moving to (4,0) puts distance between me and Insight. From there I can't reach Insight at range 2 (dist=3). Better to move to (2,2) or (5,4)... wait, valid moves don't include (5,4). Move to (4,4) gives dist=1 still adjacent. Move to (3,3) gives dist ~1.4, still adjacent. Move to (5,3) gives dist to (4,3) = ~1.4, still adjacent. Move to (2,2) gives dist to (4,3) = ~2.2, not adjacent! From (2,2) dist to Insight at (4,3) = sqrt(4+1)=2.2 tiles, within range 2? Range is ≤2 tiles. 2.2 > 2, out of range. Move to (3,3) dist to (4,3) = sqrt(1+0)=1, adjacent - blocked. Move to (5,3) dist to (4,3) = sqrt(1+0)=1, adjacent - blocked. Move to (3,1) dist to (4,3) = sqrt(1+4)=2.2, out of range. Move to (5,1) dist to (4,3) = sqrt(1+4)=2.2. Hmm. Move to (4,4) is adjacent. With 1HP I need to survive. Use suppressing_fire from current position - it works at range ≤2 tiles and doesn't require non-adjacent. Target (4,3), direction N (hits (4,3) and (4,4)). This deals 1dmg and slows Insight. Then move away.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → overclock(2,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Longshot is critically wounded at 1HP but is 3 tiles away and I can't reach in one move. Insight (oracle) is at (4,3), dist 2 - not adjacent so I can't attack. I should move toward Longshot to support, but with no heals left I can only offer overclock. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Longshot while staying away from Insight. Actually, let me check: Longshot is at (2,2). From (3,2) that's dist 1 - adjacent! I can overclock Longshot to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could be decisive at 1HP. But overclock deals 1 damage to me (8HP currently, would drop to 7HP). That's worth it to give Longshot double action. Move to (3,2) then overclock Longshot at (2,2).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed with 3HP, movement reduced to 1. Pulse is at (3,2) and already scanned. Foresight shows Insight will move to (4,3) and attack (4,2) - they're coming to me. Longshot suppressed me and is moving to (2,2). I need to reposition away from incoming Insight. Move to (4,4) to get distance, then wait since I can't scan Pulse again and no allies adjacent to recalibrate.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). No allies visible to overclock. The only enemy is Insight at dist=3, out of melee range. I should reposition safely - move toward a position that keeps me useful without exposing myself to the enemy oracle.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is at (3,3), distance 2, already scanned. Foresight shows Pulse will move to (3,2) then overclock to (2,2). I should scan Pulse again to deal 1 damage since it's within range. I'm at 3/6 HP so I want to stay safe. I'll stay put and scan Pulse for the damage, then wait.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). No allies adjacent to use overclock on. Enemy Insight is at distance 2, out of melee range. I should reposition safely - move away from the enemy oracle and hold position.
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is at (2,3), within scan range (dist=3 ≤ 4). Already have Pulse's prompt from a previous scan. Foresight shows Pulse will move to (3,3) next turn, closing distance. I should stay mobile. Scan Pulse again isn't useful since prompt is known. Instead, wait or reposition. Actually, I only see one enemy listed — Insight is our ally (oracle, A). No new targets to scan. I'll hold position and wait since there's nothing productive to do without a new target to reveal.

  💭 No heals remaining, can't patch anyone. Only enemy is Insight at dist=3, not adjacent so can't attack. No allies adjacent to overclock. Best to wait safely.
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is already scanned — prompt known. At distance 3, within scan range but no need to re-scan. I'm at 3/6 HP, should be cautious. Pulse is healthy and a medic. I should stay at range and wait — no new targets to scan, no wounded allies adjacent to recalibrate. I'll hold position this turn.

- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies adjacent to overclock. Enemy oracle is at dist=3, out of my melee range. I should reposition to support allies or get into a useful position. Moving toward allies to be in overclock range next turn.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is already scanned and prompt is known. I'm at 3 HP so I should be cautious. Pulse is at (3,3) distance 2, healthy. Both enemies waited last turn. I should reposition to maintain distance while looking for scan opportunities on Insight (not yet scanned). Insight is at unknown position. I'll move to (5,5) to stay safe and wait to see what happens.

### Turn 16 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is at distance 4 from my current position (5,5). The reconnaissance data shows Pulse is 'outRange' for scan from (5,5) — dist 4 but inRange is false, meaning scan requires strictly less than 4 tiles or the boundary condition excludes exactly 4. I need to move closer. Moving to (4,4) puts me at distance sqrt((4-3)^2+(4-3)^2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41 tiles from Pulse — well within scan range. Actually let me recalculate from (4,4) to (3,3): dist = |4-3|+|4-3| = 2 (Manhattan) or Chebyshev = 1. Either way easily within 4. But I already know Pulse's prompt from prior scan. No other enemies visible to scan. I should move to a better position and wait — moving to (4,4) maintains tactical positioning. Since Pulse's prompt is already known and no other enemies need scanning, I'll move closer but not adjacent, and wait.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). No allies adjacent to use overclock on. The enemy Insight oracle is at (4,4) distance 2, not in melee range. I should reposition safely - moving away from the enemy while staying useful. I'll move to (2,3) to stay back safely, then wait.

### Turn 17 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is already scanned and known. I'm at 3HP so I should be careful. Pulse is at (2,3) distance 3 — within scan range but already scanned. I should look for unscanned enemies. Only Pulse is visible, and it's already scanned. I'll wait in place to conserve position — no new targets to scan, no allies adjacent to recalibrate. Staying at (4,4) keeps distance from Pulse.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies adjacent to overclock. Enemy Insight is at dist=3, out of melee range. I should reposition to stay safe and potentially support allies next turn. Moving toward allies while staying away from the enemy oracle.

### Turn 18 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Insight (oracle enemy) is at (4,4) distance 2 - not adjacent so can't attack or overclock. No allies listed adjacent to me. I should reposition safely away from the enemy oracle. Moving to (2,4) keeps distance from Insight while staying mobile.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Pulse is at (2,4), distance 2 — within scan range (≤4). Already scanned Pulse so prompt is known. I should attack since I'm at 3HP and need to deal damage. Adjacent attack won't work at distance 2. Scan again isn't useful since prompt is known. Best option: move closer to attack, or just scan for 1 damage since it works at range 2. Scanning deals 1 damage even if prompt known — use scan on Pulse for 1 damage. Then consider moving. Pulse is predicted to move to (3,3) then wait — if I stay at (4,4) after scan, Pulse will be at (3,3) next round, distance ~1.4. I'm low HP at 3/6, so I should maintain distance. Move to (5,5) first to stay safe, then scan Pulse at distance ~4.2 — wait that's out of range. Let me check: (5,5) to (2,4) = sqrt(9+1)=~3.16, still in range. Or scan first from (4,4) at dist 2, then move to safety at (5,5).

### Turn 19 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No heals remaining, so patch is unavailable. No allies adjacent to overclock. No enemies in range to attack. I'm at full HP (6/11 shown but that's display). Best to position safely - move toward allies or maintain safe position away from the enemy oracle at (5,5).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Pulse is at distance 4 from my current position (5,5) — exactly at scan range limit but the recon says inRange:false. I need to close distance slightly. Moving to (4,4) puts me at distance sqrt((4-2)^2+(4-4)^2)=2, well within scan range. From (4,4) I can scan Pulse — but I already have Pulse's prompt. Actually, Pulse is already scanned. I should look for other targets or support allies. Foresight shows Insight (enemy oracle) scanned (2,4) and moved to (5,5) — Insight is now at my former position or near me. Wait, I'm at (5,5) and Insight moved to (5,5)? That means Insight is adjacent or on me. Let me reconsider: Foresight says Insight moved to (5,5) last turn — so Insight is at (5,5) with me, or that was their destination. If Insight is at (5,5), I'm adjacent to an enemy Vector... but Oracle's scan-block warning is about adjacent enemy Vectors, not Oracles. I should move away from (5,5) to avoid being adjacent to Insight. Move to (4,4) first, then scan Pulse to deal 1 damage (even though prompt is known, damage is useful at 4 HP on a 3HP me situation).

  💭 Pulse is at (2,4), distance 2, already scanned. I'm at 3HP so I need to be careful. Pulse is wounded and waited last turn. I can scan again to deal 1 damage, keeping distance. Stay at current position and scan Pulse to chip away at their HP.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I'm at 4/11 HP, wounded. Enemy Insight (oracle) is at (4,4), distance 2, so not adjacent. No allies visible to overclock. I should reposition safely - move away from the enemy oracle to avoid taking damage. Move to (1,4) to stay mobile and safe.
