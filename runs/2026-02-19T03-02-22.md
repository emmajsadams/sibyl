## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Patch** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
### Opponent
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Enemies are all at distance 4-5, none in range. Move toward center to close distance while cloaked. Lattice is a vector so I need to avoid being adjacent to it. Best move is toward (2,4) to advance up the board while staying away from Lattice at (1,5).
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,1) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=4, within my range-3 + High Ground passive (+1 rng if no adj enemy). No enemies are wounded, so orders say target the enemy medic (Patch at 4,1). I'm at (3,4), no adjacent enemies, so High Ground gives me range 4. Patch is at dist=4, in range. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. I'll fire precision_shot on Patch, then wait.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away (dist 4-7). I should advance toward the frontline to position for future healing support. Moving north toward (4,3) gets me closer to where allies will engage. No ability targets available this turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Nearest enemy is Patch at (4,3), dist=3. I need to advance. Moving to (3,3) closes distance to Patch. Both enemies are roughly south/southeast, so shield_wall facing S makes sense after moving.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Bulwark is at (3,3) directly north, Marksman at (3,4). I need to advance toward them. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer — dist 1 from Bulwark. Then shield_wall facing N to protect allies Shade and Patch from the enemy cluster ahead.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✗ Position occupied → trap(2,3) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Round 1, enemies at distance 5. I need to advance and set up trap coverage between enemy positions and my allies. Bulwark is at (3,3) and Marksman at (3,4). Enemies approaching from south area. I'll move to (2,4) to get closer to the action, then place a trap at (3,3) area — actually I should place trap on likely approach path. Moving to (2,4) first, then trap at (3,4) or (2,3) to intercept Warden approaching from (3,2) heading north toward our lines.
  State: Warden 10/10, Shade 5/5, Patch 6/6, Bulwark 10/10, Marksman 4/4, Lattice 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked and need to get behind enemies. Marksman is at (3,4) facing S, and I can reach (3,5) which is behind them. Move to (3,5) first, then use shadow_strike on Marksman — it deals 2 damage and keeps my cloak active. This is ideal: I stay invisible and chip away at a key target.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, no healing needed. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) — but I'm a medic with weak attack. Better to reposition safely. I should move away from Bulwark to avoid being locked down, then wait. Moving to (4,2) keeps distance from Bulwark and stays near Warden at (3,2) for future healing support.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are in range from current position. No wounded enemies, so orders say target the medic (Patch) at (4,2), dist=3. I'm at (3,4), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Patch is at range 3 which is within my range-3 limit. I should stay put and use precision_shot on Patch. No need to move — current position gives good range on both targets without getting adjacent to Warden at (3,2) which is dist=2.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 5-6, out of range. Marksman is wounded at (3,4) to my SE. I should move toward the center to set up a trap between enemy positions and our allies. Moving to (2,4) puts me closer to the action and lets me place a trap at (3,3) or (2,3) to block the enemy advance through the center.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) — perfect attack target. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I'm fortified (50% DR) but if I attack without moving I keep fortify. Attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall facing N to protect against the Marksman/Lattice cluster.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) to my south. Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Warden, then use shield_wall facing south (direction of enemies) to protect allies Marksman and Lattice behind me.
  State: Warden 9/10, Shade 5/5, Patch 4/6, Bulwark 9/10, Marksman 2/4, Lattice 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Marksman (wounded) at (3,4) — my current position (3,5) is their behind tile. Cloak expires after this turn so I must act now. Shadow_strike hits adjacent enemies and keeps cloak — but cloak is almost gone anyway. Better to use breach on Marksman since they're wounded and right in front of me, turning them against their team. Wait — Marksman is wounded, so shadow_strike (2dmg) likely finishes them outright. I'm already adjacent and behind. Use shadow_strike now to eliminate Marksman without breaking cloak, then move to (2,5) to get behind Lattice for next turn positioning.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(3,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at 9/10 HP and adjacent to me at (3,2). I can move to stay safe and then patch Warden. Actually, Warden is already adjacent at dist=1 (I'm at 4,2, Warden at 3,2). I should patch Warden first, then consider positioning. Patch requires adjacent target — Warden at (3,2) is adjacent to me at (4,2). Bulwark is at (3,3) dist=2, not adjacent, so patch is not blocked. Heal Warden now to keep frontliner alive.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (2,5) - perfect pulse target. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so Shade takes 1 damage. After pulsing, move to (3,4) to reposition between Warden and our allies, and use denial to block Warden's abilities next turn. Trap at (2,3) already covers southern approach.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) — attack is the clear priority. I'm fortified so I should NOT move (would lose 50% damage reduction). Use ability to attack Warden. For second action, wait to keep fortify active. Shield wall isn't better here since I can deal damage directly.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) to my north. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I can attack Bulwark now. If I move first, I lose Fortify. Better to attack first while fortified, then shield_wall facing N toward the enemy cluster (Bulwark+Lattice both north of me).
  State: Warden 9/10, Shade 4/5, Patch 4/6, Bulwark 8/10, Lattice 6/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm cloaked and need to act offensively. Lattice (vector) is at (3,4) facing E, so I'm already behind it from (2,5). The behind tile is (2,4) which is reachable. I should move to (2,4) to get adjacent and behind Lattice, then use breach on it — this will make Lattice obey me next turn, neutralizing a dangerous denial unit. Breach is ready and this is exactly the right moment to use it on the most dangerous enemy.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → patch(3,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (3,2), dist=2 from me at (4,1). I need to get adjacent to heal. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist=1 from Warden (3,2) — adjacent diagonally? No, adjacency is orthogonal. (4,2) to (3,2) is dist=1 horizontally — that's adjacent. Move to (4,2) then patch Warden at (3,2).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'm fortified and at full HP. I'll attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall facing North to protect against Bulwark and Lattice behind it. Moving would break Fortify, so I stay put.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2). Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction — I should stay put to keep Fortify active. Attack Warden first, then use shield_wall. Most enemies are to my south/east area but Warden is directly south at (3,2), Shade at (2,4) is NW, Patch at (4,2) is SE. Attacking Warden is the priority. For shield_wall, enemies cluster to my south (Warden at S) and east (Patch). S covers Warden. I'll attack Warden then shield_wall facing S to protect Lattice behind me.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (2,4) - my Denial passive blocks their cloak. Warden is at (3,2) dist=2. I should pulse to hit Shade (and possibly Warden if they're within 1 tile of me). Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - Shade at (2,4) is adjacent so they'd take 1dmg. Warden at (3,2) is dist=2, outside pulse range. After pulsing, I can place a trap at (2,3) - wait, there's already a trap there. I'll place a trap at (4,3) to block the corridor between Warden/Patch and Bulwark at (3,3). Actually I'm blocking Shade's cloak with Denial already. Pulse Shade first, then move to (4,4) to place myself between enemies and ally, or place trap at (4,3) to cover the approach from Warden/Patch side.
  State: Warden 9/10, Shade 3/5, Patch 4/6, Bulwark 6/10, Lattice 6/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice which blocks breach/cloak, but I'm already BEHIND Lattice (I'm at 2,4, Lattice faces E so behind is W side = 2,4). Denial zone blocks breach. I can still use shadow_strike (doesn't break cloak, but I'm not cloaked). Shadow_strike on Lattice (adjacent, 2dmg) is the best play — hits a healthy Vector who is dangerous. Then move away to safety at (1,3) or similar to avoid retaliation.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(3,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) and wounded at 9/10 — minor wound but I have only 1 heal left so I should save it for critical need. Shade is at 3/5 but not adjacent (dist=4). Warden is the priority frontliner to keep alive. I should move closer to Shade to potentially heal next round, but Lattice is at (3,4) — moving to (4,3) keeps me 2 tiles from Lattice (safe). Actually, Warden is adjacent and wounded — patch heals 2HP bringing to 11/10 (capped at 10), that's worth it to keep frontliner healthy. I'll patch Warden now while adjacent, then move toward Shade for future support. Moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Lattice.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Two enemies are adjacent: Warden to the south at (3,2) and Patch to the east at (4,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemy. Warden is the bigger threat (sentinel, healthy). If I attack Warden first, I stay in place and keep fortify. Enemies are to the S (Warden at dist 1) and E (Patch at dist 1), so shield_wall facing S or E. Shade is to the W at dist 2. Most enemies are E+S. I'll attack Warden (priority sentinel threat), then shield_wall facing E to block Patch. Staying put preserves fortify.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) — wounded and in range. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I'm fortified, so I'll lose that if I move. Best play: attack Bulwark first while fortified, then shield_wall facing North toward Lattice at (3,4) to block incoming damage from that direction. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is wounded and in range at (4,3) — attacking them is valuable. Warden is healthy at (3,2), distance 2. My ally Bulwark is at (3,3) wounded facing south, with Warden right below threatening them. I should attack Patch to pressure the medic and prevent healing. Then move to (4,4) to maintain range pressure and potentially place traps next turn between enemies. Pulse would hit Warden at dist 2 — out of pulse range (needs adjacent). Trap at (2,3) already placed. Consider trapping (4,3) area but Patch is on (4,3) — can't trap occupied tile. Place trap at (4,4) after moving there? No — I'd be adjacent to Warden at dist 2 after moving to (4,4), and Warden is not adjacent so trap would work. Actually let me attack Patch first (in range at dist 2), then move to maintain positioning.
  State: Warden 9/10, Shade 3/5, Patch 2/6, Bulwark 5/10, Lattice 4/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and I can reach (3,4) which is behind them. Move there, then use shadow_strike to deal 2dmg while staying cloaked — but I'm not cloaked. I'm uncloaked at 3HP. (3,4) is also behind Lattice. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to both Bulwark and Lattice. Bulwark is wounded — shadow_strike would deal 2dmg. But I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't keep cloak (irrelevant). Regular attack does 1dmg. shadow_strike does 2dmg and doesn't require cloak to USE — it just keeps cloak if I have it. So I can shadow_strike Bulwark from behind for 2dmg. Bulwark is wounded, this might finish them. Move to (3,4) then shadow_strike Bulwark at (3,3).
- **Patch** (medic): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with no heals left, adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose denial zone blocks my abilities. I can't patch or overclock. My only options are move or basic attack. Bulwark is wounded and adjacent — attacking it could help finish it off. But at 2HP I'm fragile. Best play: attack Bulwark to deal damage while I still can, then move away from Lattice to escape the denial zone and get to safety at (5,4) or similar. Actually, move first to escape Lattice adjacency won't help since abilities are already used up this turn context. I'll attack Bulwark (it's wounded, could be near death) then move away from danger toward (5,4) to survive.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) — attack it while fortified for pressure. Then shield_wall facing North to block damage from Bulwark's direction and protect nearby allies. Staying put keeps fortify active.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 2HP, fortified. Warden is adjacent to south at (3,2) and Shade is adjacent to north at (3,4). Orders say attack adjacent enemy. Warden is healthy and a bigger threat than wounded Shade. I'll attack Warden. If I don't move, I keep fortify (50% dmg reduction) which is critical at 2HP. I'll use shield_wall facing N to protect against Shade after attacking Warden — wait, Shade is to my north at (3,4). Actually Warden is at (3,2) which is SOUTH of me. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and attack if adjacent. Warden is nearest (dist=1, south). I'll attack Warden. Then shield_wall facing S won't help allies. Lattice is at (4,4) northeast. I should not move to keep fortify. Attack Warden (south), then shield_wall facing N toward Shade to protect Lattice from Shade.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Two wounded enemies adjacent: Shade at (3,4) and Patch at (5,4). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile from my position (4,4) - that would hit both Shade and Patch for 1 damage each, potentially finishing them if wounded enough. After pulse, I can place a trap between Warden and ally Bulwark at (3,3) - good chokepoint would be around (3,3) area but Bulwark is there. Place trap at (4,3) to cover approach from Warden at (3,2). My denial passive already blocks Shade/Patch abilities while adjacent.
  State: Warden 8/10, Shade 2/5, Patch 1/6, Bulwark 2/10, Lattice 4/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,3) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, adjacent to both Bulwark (critical) and Lattice (healthy). Lattice's denial zone blocks cloak/breach but NOT shadow_strike or basic attack. Bulwark is critical and I'm already behind it (facing S, I'm at 3,4 which is its back). Shadow_strike deals 2dmg and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked. I should use shadow_strike on Bulwark to finish it off (critical = 1-2HP left, 2dmg should kill it), then I'm exposed next to Lattice. After killing Bulwark, I should move away from Lattice to avoid taking damage while at 2HP. Move to (3,5) to get distance from Lattice after the strike.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/6 HP — critically wounded and adjacent to Lattice's denial zone. Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I cannot use abilities while in denial zone anyway. My allies need healing but I can't provide it. Priority: survive by escaping Lattice. Move to (5,5) to get away from Lattice and out of denial zone. Then wait — no abilities available and I'm too low HP to engage.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) and critical — attack to finish them. I'm fortified so I should not move to keep 50% damage reduction. Shield_wall facing N toward the enemy cluster after attacking.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(5,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is critical and adjacent at (5,5) - attack to potentially eliminate. Shade is wounded at (3,5) and in range too. I'm at (4,4). Attacking Patch at range 2 makes sense. Then I should consider moving or using another ability. Actually, I can attack Patch (critical) to try to finish them. For second action, I could move to (4,5) to get adjacent to Patch for a guaranteed kill next turn, but that puts me next to Shade too. Better: attack Patch now (in range 2), then place trap at (4,3) to block Warden approach - wait, trap blocked if adjacent to enemy? Shade is at dist 2, not adjacent. I can trap. Actually let me attack Patch first (critical = likely low HP, 1dmg might finish), then place trap on approach path. Trap at (4,3) or (3,3) to intercept Warden coming from (3,2). Place trap at (3,3) to catch Warden moving north.
  State: Warden 8/10, Shade 2/5, Patch 1/6, Lattice 4/6 | Dead: Bulwark, Marksman

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 2HP, Lattice is at (4,4) facing E. I'm already behind Lattice — (3,4) is a behind tile and it's adjacent. I should move to (3,4) to get behind Lattice, then use breach to take control of the vector. Breach requires being behind the enemy and adjacent, which (3,4) satisfies. This is the perfect moment to use breach on Lattice — vectors are the most dangerous enemy and this eliminates their denial zone threat.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/6 HP with no heals left — extremely fragile. Lattice (vector) is at (4,4), dist=2, so I must not move adjacent to it (would block abilities and put me in danger). Shade is wounded at (3,4) dist=3, Warden at (3,2) dist=5. I can't heal anyone. Best play is to move away from Lattice to stay alive. Valid moves: (3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4). Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to Shade without going adjacent to Lattice at (4,4) — dist from (3,5) to (4,4) is ~1.4, that's adjacent diagonally. Moving to (4,5) keeps dist=2 from Lattice. Moving to (5,3) or (5,4) keeps me far from allies. I'll move to (4,5) to slightly close on Shade while staying 2 tiles from Lattice. No useful ability — can't heal, overclock requires adjacency and I'd take 1 damage (which would kill me at 1HP). Wait as second action.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Orders say push forward aggressively. Lattice is at (4,4), dist 3 — I can't attack yet. Patch is critical at (4,5), Shade is wounded at (3,4). Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to both allies and toward Lattice without going adjacent (which would block abilities). From (3,3) I could shield_wall facing N to protect Shade and Patch from Lattice. This keeps me aggressive while supporting the team.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is critical and adjacent at (4,5) - pulse will hit both Shade at (3,4) and Patch at (4,5) since they're within 1 tile. Pulse deals 1dmg to ALL units within 1 tile. That could finish off Patch and further wound Shade. Then I can place a trap at (3,5) to cut off Shade's escape route and block the corridor between enemies.
  State: Warden 6/10, Shade 1/5, Lattice 4/6 | Dead: Patch, Bulwark, Marksman

### Turn 9 — player
- **Shade** (specter): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, adjacent to Lattice who has DENIAL active blocking cloak/breach. I'm already behind Lattice (behind tiles include my current position). I can use shadow_strike which keeps cloak and works adjacent — but wait, I'm not cloaked. With DENIAL active, only basic attack and movement work. So I should use basic attack on Lattice (adjacent, 1dmg) and that's all I can do offensively. Warden is allied at (3,3). I need to be careful — at 1HP any hit kills me. Attack Lattice for 1dmg with basic attack.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → pulse(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 3HP, facing two enemies: Warden at (3,3) wounded and Shade at (2,4) critical. Both are in range 2. Shade is critical - pulse won't reach both since they're not within 1 tile of me. I have traps at (2,3), (4,3), (3,5). I need to be careful - I'm wounded too. Shade is a specter at critical HP - if I can deny or pressure, good. Warden is wounded sentinel. My denial passive blocks adjacent enemies from using certain abilities. Moving to (3,4) would put me adjacent to both Warden(3,3) and potentially close to Shade(2,4). At (3,4): Warden at (3,3) is adjacent - denial kicks in. Shade at (2,4) would be dist=1 - also adjacent, denial applies. Then I can pulse to hit both since they'd both be within 1 tile of (3,4). Pulse does 1dmg to ALL units within 1 tile - that would hit Warden AND Shade simultaneously. Shade is critical so any damage likely finishes them. Warden is wounded. This is a strong play: move to (3,4), then pulse to hit both adjacent enemies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice is adjacent at (3,4) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. DENIAL zone means only basic attack/movement work — no shield_wall or intercept. Attack Lattice directly while fortified. Staying put preserves fortify. Attack first, then wait to keep fortify active.
  State: Warden 5/10, Lattice 2/6 | Dead: Shade, Patch, Bulwark, Marksman

### Turn 10 — player
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3), wounded. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile — that's Warden for 1dmg. Warden is wounded so this could finish or severely pressure them. My Denial passive already blocks some of Warden's abilities since they're adjacent. After pulsing, I should move to avoid retaliation — step to (4,4) to stay near chokepoints but not adjacent.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 4HP. Lattice is at (4,4), dist=2, out of attack range. Orders say push forward aggressively. If I move to (4,3), I'll be adjacent to Lattice at (4,4) and can attack. Moving north puts me at (3,4) which is still dist=2. Moving to (4,3) closes to adjacent. After moving to (4,3), Lattice is at (4,4) — that's directly north, so I can attack. But I lose fortify by moving. Still, orders say push aggressively and attack when possible.
