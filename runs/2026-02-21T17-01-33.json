Move to (5,5) to get away from Rampart, then use overclock on Rampart (our sentinel ally) if adjacent - but Rampart is at (4,4) and after moving to (5,5) distance becomes 2, out of adjacent range. Better to move to (5,3) to put distance. Actually, I should check if overclock on Rampart is useful before moving. Rampart is adjacent at (4,4) now. I can overclock Rampart first (taking 1 dmg, going to 2HP) then move away. Overclock gives Rampart 2 abilities next turn which could be very impactful for a sentinel. But I'd drop to 2HP which is risky. Alternatively just move away to safety. With only 3HP and enemies adjacent, retreating is safer. Move to (5,5) to escape Rampart's melee range, then wait.",
