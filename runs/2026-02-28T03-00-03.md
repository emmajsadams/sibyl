## Squads
### Player
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
### Opponent
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Doc is closest at dist 3, at (1,1) facing N. I should cloak then advance toward Doc to set up a shadow_strike or breach next turn. Moving to (1,2) gets me 1 tile away from Doc while staying cloaked.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away. I should advance toward the center while staying safe. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer to allies and toward the action. No overclock targets yet since allies haven't acted and no one needs extra actions at this range.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(4,1) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Hawk at (4,5) who is closer. Move to (4,4) to get within striking range next turn while cloaked.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest enemy is Rampart at dist=5. Need to close distance while staying at max range (2 tiles). Moving to (2,2) gets me closer without entering adjacent range. From (2,2), Rampart at (2,5) is still dist=3, still out of range=2. Best I can do is move toward Rampart. Let me check: from (2,2) Rampart is at dist=3, still out of range. No shot available this turn regardless. Move to maximize position for next turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 5, out of my range 2. I need to close distance. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer without overextending. No shot available this turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so advance toward nearest enemies (Bolt @2,2 and Doc @1,3). Moving to (2,3) closes distance maximally along my path. Both enemies are to the south, so shield_wall facing S covers that direction.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Ghost 4/4, Doc 12/12, Rampart 8/8, Hawk 5/5, Phantom 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and already behind Doc (medic) at (1,3) — I'm at (1,2) and Doc faces N, so (1,2) is directly behind them. I should breach Doc first to take control of the medic, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Breach requires being behind the enemy — I'm already there. After breach, I can shadow_strike Doc since I'm adjacent and cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): breach(4,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already at (4,4) which is directly behind Hawk at (4,3) facing S. Cloak has 1 turn remaining — if I use it now it breaks on attack, but breach doesn't break cloak. I should use breach on Hawk now while I'm behind them and cloaked. This is the ideal setup: adjacent, behind, cloaked. Save shadow_strike for later. After breach I can move to reposition for next turn.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward enemies, attack Bolt if adjacent. Bolt is an ally at (2,2) - but orders say attack Bolt. I need to move toward enemies while away from allies. Phantom is at (1,2) dist=1, Rampart at (2,3) dist=1. Bolt is ally at (2,2). Moving to (2,1) gets me closer to enemies and away from Ghost at (3,4). From (2,1) I'm adjacent to Bolt at (2,2) - orders say attack Bolt if adjacent. Let me move to (2,1) then attack Bolt.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. Current position (4,3). Allies are at (2,3) and (1,2), so moving east/right increases distance from them. Ghost is at (3,4) distance 2 - adjacent threat. Moving to (5,4) goes toward the east edge, away from allies, and I can shoot Ghost with precision_shot from there (dist=2 from Ghost at 3,4 → new dist would be sqrt((5-3)²+(4-4)²)=2, still in range).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Both Rampart and Phantom are adjacent (dist=1). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but these are sentinel and specter. However, orders say never move adjacent to enemies, and I'm already adjacent to both. I need to move away first. Best move is to (3,2) or (4,2) to get distance from both enemies while staying in range. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist=2 from Rampart(2,3) and dist=3 from Phantom(1,2). From (4,2), Rampart at (2,3) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2 tiles — actually Manhattan dist=3, out of range 2. Let me recalculate: from (4,2) to Rampart(2,3): |4-2|+|2-3|=2+1=3, out of range. From (3,2) to Rampart(2,3): |3-2|+|2-3|=1+1=2, in range! From (3,2) to Phantom(1,2): |3-1|+|2-2|=2, in range! Move to (3,2) then precision_shot Phantom or Rampart. No wounded enemies, no medic visible. Target Rampart as nearest threat. I moved so precision_shot is blocked (1dmg only if moved). Still worth it.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so can't attack. Three enemies at dist 2: Bolt at (3,2), Ghost at (3,4), Doc at (2,1). Moving to (3,3) advances toward Bolt and Ghost simultaneously. From (3,3), enemies are clustered to S and W. Use shield_wall facing S to block Doc/Bolt direction, but Ghost is W. Most enemies are in S/W quadrant. Moving to (3,3) puts Bolt at (3,2) adjacent to S, Ghost at (3,4) adjacent to N, Doc at (2,1) dist 2. After moving, Bolt will be adjacent - but I use ability after move. Shield_wall facing S covers Bolt direction.
  State: Bolt 4/5, Ghost 3/4, Doc 11/12, Rampart 7/8, Hawk 5/5, Phantom 4/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining), so I can't use it this round. Both Doc and Bolt are reachable from (2,2) — that tile is behind both of them and adjacent. Doc is the high-value medic target. I'm not cloaked, so I'll move to (2,2) and use shadow_strike on Doc at (2,1) — shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked anyway. Actually I should just use attack or shadow_strike. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak (irrelevant now), attack deals 1dmg and breaks cloak (also irrelevant). I'll use shadow_strike on Doc since it's the same damage and slightly better ability. Move to (2,2), then shadow_strike Doc at (2,1).
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Rampart is adjacent but I'm not behind it — behind tile is (2,3). Hawk is at (5,4) with behind tile (5,3) reachable. I'm at 3HP, uncloaked. Best play: move to (5,3) to get behind Hawk, then shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying hidden. This positions me for a breach next turn when cooldown clears.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward enemies, attack Bolt if adjacent. Bolt is at (3,2) dist=2, not adjacent. Phantom is adjacent at (2,2). I should move toward enemies - moving to (3,1) gets me closer to Bolt and enemies. From (3,1), Bolt at (3,2) would be adjacent (dist=1), so I can attack. Let me move to (3,1) first, then attack Bolt.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(5,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies toward the edge. Ghost is adjacent at (5,3) - I'm at (5,4). Moving to (5,5) gets me to the top edge, away from allies at (3,3) and (2,2). But Ghost is adjacent, which blocks precision_shot. I can use suppressing_fire or attack on Ghost, then move to edge. Attack Ghost at (5,3) for 1dmg, then move to (5,5) to reach the edge.
- **Bolt** (striker): suppressing_fire(3,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies in range are adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot for Vector class - but I'm a Striker, not Vector. However, orders say never move adjacent to enemies, and both Rampart and Phantom are already adjacent to me at dist=1. I need to move away first to get to range 2, then use precision_shot. Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist=2 from Rampart (3,3) and dist=3 from Phantom (2,2). From (4,3), Rampart at (3,3) is dist=1 - still adjacent. Let me try (5,2): dist from Rampart(3,3)=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, dist from Phantom(2,2)=sqrt(9+0)=3. Valid moves include (5,2). From (5,2), Rampart at (3,3) is dist ~2.2 - out of range 2. Hawk at (5,5) is dist=3 - out of range. Phantom at (2,2) is dist=3 - out of range. Both enemies are currently at dist=1 (adjacent), so I should move to (4,3) which puts me at dist sqrt(1+1)~1.4 from Rampart - still close. Best escape: move to (5,2), then use suppressing_fire or basic attack on nearest reachable enemy. Actually from (5,2) nothing in range. Try (4,3): Rampart(3,3) dist=sqrt(1+0)=1 - still adjacent. Move to (3,4): Rampart(3,3) dist=1 still adjacent. Move to (2,3): Phantom(2,2) dist=1, Rampart(3,3) dist=sqrt(1+0)=1. All moves keep me near enemies. Best option: move to (5,2) to maximize distance, then wait since no enemies in range. Actually Rampart is healthy, Phantom is healthy - orders say target medic if no one wounded, but medic (Doc) is ally. No enemy medic visible. Use suppressing_fire on Rampart from current position before moving - it works adjacent? Suppressing_fire range ≤2 tiles, so dist=1 is valid. Fire first, then move away.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(5,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so can only move 1 tile. Enemies are to the east and south (Ghost at 5,3 dist=2, Doc at 3,1 dist=2, Bolt at 5,2 dist=3). Moving to (4,3) advances toward Ghost and Bolt. After moving I lose Fortify, so I'll use shield_wall facing East to block incoming damage from Ghost/Bolt cluster.
  State: Bolt 3/5, Ghost 2/4, Doc 10/12, Rampart 6/8, Hawk 4/5, Phantom 4/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward enemies, attack Bolt if adjacent. Bolt is an ally so I should NOT attack them - that order seems like a test or error. I should move toward enemies. Phantom is at (2,2) dist=2, already in range but I can't attack from range - attack is melee/adjacent only. Moving to (4,1) gets me closer to Rampart and away from allies. Actually, orders say attack Bolt if adjacent - Bolt is an ally, I will not attack allies. I'll move toward enemies: moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Rampart's direction and closer to enemies. Let me move to (4,1) to advance toward enemies. Phantom is at (2,2), moving away from them toward enemy cluster. Move to (4,1) then wait - no ability targets adjacent.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, uncloaked, with Rampart adjacent to my west. I can't survive another hit easily. Hawk is at (5,5) facing N, meaning (5,4) is behind them and reachable. I should move to (5,4) to get behind Hawk, then use breach on Hawk — that wastes their turn and removes a striker threat. Alternatively, shadow_strike Rampart from current position deals 1dmg and I stay safe. But Rampart is healthy and I'd need to finish them later. Better play: move to (5,4) to get behind Hawk, then breach Hawk (sentinel is slow, Hawk is dangerous striker). This repositions me away from Rampart and neutralizes Hawk for a turn.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(4,1) ✓
  💭 Doc is the priority target — keeping the enemy medic alive means wounded enemies heal up. I can reach (3,1) which is behind Doc, then use breach to take control. Bolt is wounded but breach on Doc is higher value to prevent healing. Move to (3,1) and breach Doc.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and into open ground, away from combat. Current position (5,5), allies at (4,3) and (3,1), enemies nearby at (5,4). Valid moves: (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3). Moving to (3,5) gets me furthest from the combat cluster near (5,2)-(5,4) and away from allies. Then wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic if present. No medic in enemy roster - enemies are sentinel, striker, specter. Phantom (specter) is at dist 3, outside my range 2. Rampart (sentinel) is at dist 2, in range. I'm at (5,2), not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. Stay at max range - current position is fine at dist 2 from Rampart. Use precision_shot on Rampart since they're the closest threat and in range.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) E ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so can't attack. Nearest enemies are Bolt(5,2), Ghost(5,4), Doc(4,1) all at dist 2. Moving to (5,3) gets me adjacent to both Bolt and Ghost. Most enemies are to my east/northeast, so shield_wall facing E after moving makes sense. Move to (5,3) first, then shield_wall E.
  State: Bolt 3/5, Ghost 2/4, Doc 10/12, Rampart 5/8, Hawk 4/5, Phantom 4/4

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is adjacent at (4,1) and I'm already behind them (they face E, I'm at (3,1) which is their west/behind). I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't keep cloak, but a regular attack on the healthy medic is high value. I can attack Doc first, then move toward Bolt at (5,2) by moving to (4,2) which is also behind Bolt.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(5,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with Rampart adjacent. Breach is exhausted. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked. Rampart is healthy and adjacent, Hawk is at (3,5) behind tile reachable at (4,5). I should move to (4,3) to get behind Rampart and shadow_strike — but wait, shadow_strike requires being adjacent AND keeps cloak only if already cloaked. I'm not cloaked. Regular attack deals 1dmg but breaks cloak (irrelevant, not cloaked). Shadow_strike: range adjacent only, keeps cloak. I can use shadow_strike on Rampart from current position (dist=1, adjacent). That deals 1dmg. Or I can move to (4,5) to get behind Hawk, but Hawk is healthier and further. Best play: shadow_strike Rampart now (1dmg, no cloak needed to use it), then move to (4,5) to set up Hawk for next turn. Actually shadow_strike just says 'keeps cloak' — it still works uncloaked, just doesn't break cloak. Use shadow_strike on Rampart (adjacent), then move to (4,5) behind Hawk for next turn positioning.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. My allies are at (5,2) and (4,5). The edge tiles available include (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0) — bottom edge. Moving to (5,0) gets me to the corner edge and away from allies. No healing ordered.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded and adjacent (dist=1), but precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - wait, Phantom is at dist=1 not Vector. The warning says precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Phantom is a specter, not a vector. So precision_shot should work. However, both Rampart and Phantom are at dist=1 (adjacent). I need to move away first to avoid being adjacent, then use precision_shot. Valid moves: (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,4). From (5,4), Rampart at (5,3) is dist=1 still adjacent. From (3,2): Rampart(5,3) dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, Phantom(4,2) dist=1 still adjacent. From (4,3): Rampart(5,3) dist=sqrt(1+0)=1, still adjacent. From (4,1): Rampart(5,3) dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, Phantom(4,2) dist=1 still adjacent. From (5,1): Rampart(5,3) dist=2, Phantom(4,2) dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4. So (5,1) puts me at range 2 from Rampart (in range), and ~1.4 from Phantom (not adjacent). Orders say stay at max range and use precision_shot on most wounded. Rampart is wounded. Move to (5,1) then precision_shot Rampart at (5,3) from dist=2. But moving means precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Still worth it to avoid adjacency penalty and follow orders to not move adjacent.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and into open ground, away from combat. Currently at (3,5) with Ghost adjacent at (4,5). Valid moves include (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,5). Allies are at (5,3) and (4,2). Moving to (1,5) puts me furthest from combat and allies, away from Ghost and the enemy cluster in the southeast.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → attack(5,1) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (5,1), distance 2 south. Moving to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Bolt. Enemies are mostly to the south, so shield_wall facing S after moving would protect allies. But I only have 3HP so staying fortified has value. Moving loses fortify. Bolt is wounded - I should try to finish them. Move to (5,2) to get adjacent to Bolt, then attack.
  State: Bolt 2/5, Ghost 2/4, Doc 9/12, Rampart 3/8, Hawk 4/5, Phantom 4/4

### Turn 6 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,5) ✓
  💭 At 2HP I need to be careful. Breach is exhausted. Hawk is at (1,5) facing W with behind tile at (2,5) which is reachable. I can move to (2,5) to get behind Hawk and use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked — but I'm not cloaked currently. Still, shadow_strike from adjacent is good. Move to (2,5) puts me adjacent and behind Hawk for a shadow_strike hit.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. Bolt is at (5,1) adjacent to me, Ghost is far away. I need to move away from allies. Valid moves: [2,0],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0],[4,1],[5,3]. Moving to (3,0) takes me away from Bolt at (5,1) and toward the bottom edge. Then I can move again to (2,0) to get further away.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,0) ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded at (5,1) and only 2 tiles away — but not adjacent and breach is exhausted. Doc is healthy and 4 tiles away; I can reach behind-tile (3,0) in one move. Moving to (3,0) puts me adjacent and behind Doc for a shadow_strike. That's the priority: eliminate the healer. Move to (3,0), then shadow_strike Doc at (2,0) while staying cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and into open ground, away from combat. I'm at (1,5) with Ghost adjacent at (2,5). Valid moves: (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,5). Allies are at (5,2) and (3,0). Moving to (0,4) takes me to the corner away from everyone. Then I can move again to (0,5) or wait. Actually with mv2 I can reach (0,4) in one move - wait, I need to check if I can chain moves. Each turn I get one move action of up to 2 tiles. So I move to (0,4) to get away from Ghost at (2,5) and away from allies. Then wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → precision_shot(5,2) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Rampart is adjacent (dist=1) at (5,2). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy, so I cannot use it. I should move away first to get range, then use precision_shot. Moving to (4,0) or (3,1) would put me at dist 2-3 from Rampart. Move to (4,2) keeps dist=1 (adjacent). Best move: (4,0) puts me at dist ~2.8 from Rampart (not adjacent), then use precision_shot. Wait - valid moves include (5,3) which is dist=1 from Rampart still adjacent. (4,0) is sqrt((5-4)^2+(2-0)^2)=sqrt(5)~2.2, not adjacent, range<=2 so precision_shot would work. Move to (4,0) first, then precision_shot Rampart to finish them off (they're wounded).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) W ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Nearest enemy is Bolt at (4,0), dist 3. I'm at (5,2) with speed 1 (wounded). Moving toward Bolt: best move is (4,1) to close distance. Then shield_wall facing W/S where enemies cluster (Bolt at 4,0 is SW, Doc at 2,0 is W). Facing S covers Bolt direction best from (4,1).
  State: Bolt 2/5, Ghost 2/4, Doc 8/12, Rampart 3/8, Hawk 3/5, Phantom 4/4

### Turn 7 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(0,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded at (0,4) facing S, and (0,5) is both reachable and behind Hawk. I'm at 2HP so need to be careful, but Hawk is wounded too. Move to (0,5) to get behind Hawk, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked (if cloaked) or just strike. I'm not currently cloaked based on no cloak indicator, so shadow_strike still works adjacent. Move to (0,5) then shadow_strike Hawk at (0,4).
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. Allies are at (4,0) and (0,5). Edge tiles available: (0,0), (5,0), (1,0). Moving to (5,0) gets me to the far right edge and away from both allies. That's the best edge tile.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(4,0) ✓ → move(4,1) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile
  💭 Bolt is adjacent at (4,0) and wounded. I'm cloaked (or should be) and shadow_strike keeps cloak while dealing damage. Breach is unavailable. Best play: shadow_strike Bolt to finish it off, then move toward Doc at (5,0) to pressure the medic. Shadow_strike works on adjacent targets and preserves cloak.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,0) with 1HP - critically low. Phantom is adjacent at (3,0) and Rampart is adjacent at (4,1). Being adjacent to Phantom (a Vector? No, specter) - wait, the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Phantom is a specter, not a vector, so precision_shot should work. But I need to move away first to avoid being adjacent. Valid moves: (2,0), (3,1), (4,2), (5,1). Moving to (5,1) puts me at dist 1 from Rampart still. Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (4,1). Moving to (2,0) gets me away from both but is dist 1 from Phantom still... wait Phantom is at (3,0), so (2,0) would be dist 1. Moving to (3,1) - Phantom at (3,0) is dist 1, Rampart at (4,1) is dist ~1.4. None of these moves fully escape adjacency. Best bet: move to (5,1) to escape Phantom, then precision_shot Rampart (wounded) from dist ~1.4 - but wait, from (5,1) Rampart at (4,1) is dist 1, still in range. Actually precision_shot range is <=2 tiles. Rampart is wounded - priority kill target. From (5,1), Rampart at (4,1) is dist 1. Phantom would be at (3,0), dist ~2.2 from (5,1) - out of adjacent range. Move to (5,1) first, then precision_shot Rampart. But I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2. Rampart is wounded - likely has low HP. 1dmg might finish it. This is the best play.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(0,5) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded and adjacent at (0,5). I'm a striker - precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and LoS, but is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Ghost is at distance 1 (adjacent), so precision_shot is blocked by Vector rule... wait, the warning says 'blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' - that's specifically the Vector unit type, not just any enemy. Ghost is a specter, not a Vector. So precision_shot should work. Ghost is at dist=1 which is ≤2 range. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. Ghost is wounded (likely 1-2 HP remaining), so 2dmg should kill. Use precision_shot on Ghost first, then move to safety away from threats.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(5,1) ✓ → shield_wall(5,0) E ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent at (5,1) and critical — attack to finish them. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is ideal. Attack Bolt first, then shield_wall facing East (toward Doc at (5,0)) to protect against follow-up.
  State: Doc 8/12, Rampart 2/8, Hawk 2/5, Phantom 4/4 | Dead: Bolt, Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,0) ✓ → patch(4,1) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Rampart is critical and adjacent-range (dist=2, so not adjacent — adjacent means dist=1). I'm at (5,0), Rampart is at (4,1): Manhattan distance = 1+1 = 2, not adjacent. I need to move to be adjacent to Rampart to heal. Valid moves include (4,0) which puts me at dist=1 from Rampart at (4,1) — adjacent. Phantom is at (3,0) dist=2, not a threat for blocking patch this turn if I'm at (4,0). Move to (4,0) then patch Rampart.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(4,0) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (4,0). I'm cloaked (or can act offensively). Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak — use it on Doc now. Then move to (5,0) to get behind Doc for future pressure.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is at (4,0), distance 6 - out of range. Need to close distance. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer. Then next turn I can move to (4,2) or (3,2) for a shot. Rampart is critical at (4,1) near Doc - priority to eliminate Doc before Doc heals. Move toward Doc, position for next turn shot.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (4,0). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction at 2HP. Attack Doc since they're wounded and in range. Stay put to keep fortify bonus active.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → patch(4,1) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 I'm Doc at (4,0) with 6/12 HP, facing Phantom at (5,0) adjacent and Rampart at (4,1) also adjacent. Rampart is critical and needs healing urgently. But my patch/overclock abilities are blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — Phantom is a specter, not Vector, so I should still be able to heal. I need to heal Rampart immediately since they're critical. I should move away from Phantom first to get safer positioning, then heal Rampart — but wait, if I move, Rampart may no longer be adjacent. Let me check: if I move to (3,1), Rampart at (4,1) would be at dist=1, still adjacent. That gets me away from Phantom. Then I can patch Rampart. Actually, I go first in turn order so I can act before enemies. Best plan: move to (3,1) to escape Phantom's adjacency, then patch Rampart at (4,1) who is still adjacent at dist=1.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Doc is at (3,1) facing N, wounded. I'm at (5,0). Valid moves include (3,0) which is behind Doc and adjacent. I can move to (3,0) and shadow_strike Doc while cloaked — shadow_strike keeps cloak active. This is the priority play.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded at (3,1), distance 4 - out of range. I need to close to range 2 (distance ≤2). Moving to (3,3) gets me distance ~2 from (3,1). Actually from (3,3) to (3,1) is dist=2, exactly in range. No enemies adjacent so precision_shot is available. Move to (3,3) then fire precision_shot on Doc.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent to the west at (3,1). I'm at 2HP but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Doc who is wounded - this could finish them. Stay in place to keep fortify active.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP/12HP - critically wounded. Three enemies adjacent or near me: Phantom at (3,0) dist=1, Rampart at (4,1) dist=1. I'm the medic and I'm the lowest HP ally (3/12), but patch only heals allies not self. I need to escape. My allies are not visible in the order list as wounded - wait, the order shows only me as ally (A). I need to move away from danger. Phantom is at (3,0) to my south, Rampart at (4,1) to my east. Moving north/northwest gets me away. Move to (2,3) to escape both adjacent enemies, then wait. Actually I should move as far as possible - (2,3) or (1,2). Let me move to (2,3) to get distance from Rampart and Phantom. No allies to heal nearby. I'll move away and wait.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is critical and at (2,3) facing N. I need to get adjacent to use shadow_strike. The behind tile (2,2) is adjacent to Doc and reachable. I can move to (2,2) which is behind Doc, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. With breach unavailable, shadow_strike is my best option to finish off the critical medic.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (2,3) and critical - but precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy. I need to move away first to get range, then use precision_shot to finish Doc. Moving to (3,4) keeps me 1 tile away from Doc's current position and gives range of ~1.4 tiles. Actually, moving to (4,3) puts me at distance 2 from Doc, enabling precision_shot without the adjacency block.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 2/8 HP with fortify active, I need to advance toward Doc at (2,3) while staying alive. I can move up to 2 tiles. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Doc and keeps me near Hawk at (4,3). No enemies adjacent so no attack possible. I'll move toward Doc and wait since no ability targets are in range.
