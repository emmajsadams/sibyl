## Squads
### Player
- **Lens** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(4,5) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are far away (dist 5-9), so I can safely cloak and advance toward the nearest threat (Deadeye at 3,1). Move toward center to close distance while cloaked.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, perfect time to cloak. Enemies are far away (dist 8-10). I'll cloak first, then move toward the center to advance on enemy lines while invisible.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,1) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range. I need to advance to get within 4 tiles. Moving to (4,1) brings me closer — Lens at (4,4) would be dist=3, in range. Then I can scan Lens.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, both enemies in scan range. Lens (oracle) at dist=3 is higher priority target - scanning reveals their strategy and deals 1dmg. Then recalibrate Shade (specter ally at 3,3, adjacent) to boost effectiveness. Stay at current position (4,4) - no need to move.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 4-6, my range is 2). Orders say maintain distance. Enemy oracle at dist 4 is closer and high-value. I should advance cautiously to get into range while maintaining positioning. Moving to (3,3) brings me closer to the oracle at (4,4) which would then be dist 2 — within precision_shot range. But I should check: (3,3) to (4,4) = |4-3|+|4-3| = 2, so that's exactly range 2. I'll move to (3,3) to potentially get a shot off, but enemy oracle already acted this round. Best play is to advance and wait for next round.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5 and 6, my range is 2). I need to close distance. Moving to (5,3) gets me closer while staying at max range from enemies at y=1. Valid moves are [3,5],[4,5],[5,3],[5,4]. Moving to (5,3) reduces distance to Lens from 5 to 3, still out of range but closing. Then wait as no target in range yet.
  State: Lens 7/10, Deadeye 3/3, Veil 4/4, Shade 4/4, Deadeye 3/3, Lens 7/10

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(5,3) ✓ → move(3,0) ✓
  💭 Shade cloaked and moved to (3,3) last turn — likely threatening our cluster. Enemy Deadeye is at (5,3) and hasn't been scanned yet. I should scan the enemy Deadeye to reveal their prompt. I'm at (4,1), Deadeye is at (5,3) — dist=3, within scan range. I can scan Deadeye this turn. No enemy vectors adjacent so scan is not blocked. After scanning, I'll stay put or move to maintain range.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Deadeye is at (3,1) facing N, so I need to get behind them at (3,0) — but that's occupied by enemy Lens. No valid breach positions reachable this turn. I should close distance while staying cloaked. Move to (3,2) to get adjacent to Deadeye, then shadow_strike them (keeps cloak, 1dmg). Shadow_strike works from adjacent and keeps cloak — perfect.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Enemy Lens is at (4,4) facing S, dist=5. No positions behind Lens are reachable this turn. I need to close the gap while staying cloaked. Moving toward (4,2) gets me closer and within striking range next turn. Best valid move toward enemy is (4,2) - that's 3 tiles away from Lens.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,1) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at dist=4, in scan range. Lens is at dist=5, out of range. Priority: scan Deadeye to reveal their strategy. I'm at (4,4), healthy. No adjacent enemies so scan is not blocked. After scanning Deadeye, I could recalibrate Shade who is at (3,2) — but that's not adjacent to me (dist=2), so recalibrate won't work from here. I'll move closer to Shade for recalibrate next turn, or just wait as second action. Move to (3,3) gets me adjacent to Shade but Shade moved to (3,3) last turn per foresight... actually Shade moved to (3,3) last turn. Current position of Shade shown as (3,2). I'll scan Deadeye first, then move to (4,3) to stay back and maintain positioning without getting too close to enemies.
  State: Lens 7/10, Veil 4/4, Shade 4/4, Lens 7/10 | Dead: Deadeye, Deadeye

### Turn 3 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(3,2) ✓ → scan(3,0) ✓
  💭 Lens just scanned me last turn (Foresight shows scan→(4,3) which is my position). I already know Lens's prompt. Priority: recalibrate Shade (our damage dealer at (3,2)) to boost effectiveness, then scan Lens again or reposition. Shade is adjacent to me at (3,2) — I can recalibrate them. Lens is at range 4 from current position, so I can scan after recalibrating. I should recalibrate Shade first, then scan Lens to deal damage and keep intel fresh.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,0) ✓ → scan(3,2) ✓
  💭 Lens already scanned — prompt known. Shade is moving toward (3,2) and shadow_striking (3,1), so I need to avoid (3,1). I'm at (3,0) and Shade is threatening my area. I should move away from Shade's predicted path while maintaining scan range on Lens. Moving to (5,0) keeps me safe from Shade and Lens stays at distance 4+. Actually Lens is at (4,3), dist from (5,0) = 1+3=4, still in scan range. But I already know Lens's prompt. Better to scan Shade (specter, cloaked) — Shade is predicted at (3,2) after move. From (3,0), dist to (3,2) = 2, in scan range. I should scan Shade to reveal their prompt. Move first to reposition away from threat, then scan Shade.
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,0) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, at 1HP — extremely fragile. Enemy Lens is at (5,0) facing E, and (4,0) is directly behind them and reachable. I can move to (4,0) which is adjacent and behind, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This is the perfect setup.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,0) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn, so I must use it now. Lens (oracle) is adjacent at (4,3) but I'm not behind it yet — behind tile is (4,4). Shade (specter) is critical at (4,0), behind tile is (4,1). Best play: move to (4,1) to get behind Shade (critical enemy, easier kill), then shadow_strike for 1dmg — keeps cloak and finishes or weakens Shade. Shade is critical so this likely finishes it.
  State: Lens 3/10, Veil 4/4, Lens 7/10 | Dead: Deadeye, Shade, Deadeye

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP with enemies closing in. Foresight shows Shade moved to (4,0) and used shadow_strike on (5,0) — that's my position, so Shade hit me last turn. Lens is at (4,3) in range. I need to scan Lens for 1 damage and intel. Then move away from danger — Shade is likely near (4,0) still. Moving to (5,3) gets me distance from Shade while keeping Lens in scan range.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) adjacent to Lens at (5,3) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Lens is an oracle not a vector, so scan should work. However, Lens is already scanned. Veil is a specter at (4,1) dist=2, in scan range and not yet scanned. I should scan Veil to reveal their prompt. But first I need to move away from Lens to avoid being adjacent (risky for melee). Move to (3,3) to get distance from Lens, then scan Veil at (4,1) from dist ~2. Actually from (3,3) Veil at (4,1) is dist=3, still in scan range. This gives me distance from Lens while scanning Veil.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 1HP — extremely fragile. Enemy Lens is at (3,3) facing W, wounded. Behind tile is (4,3) which is reachable and adjacent. I can move to (4,3) to get behind Lens, then use breach to take control. Breach is ready and this is the perfect moment — enemy is wounded and I'm behind them. Shadow_strike would only do 1dmg, but breach lets me control them next turn which could be devastating. With only 1HP I need to act decisively.
