## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Patch** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are 5-7 tiles away, no threats adjacent. After cloaking, advance south toward the enemy lines. Veil (specter) at (2,0) and Aegis (sentinel) at (3,1) are priority targets. Move toward (2,2) to close distance while cloaked, keeping options open for flanking Veil or getting behind Aegis next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → overclock(5,5) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away. I should position myself closer to allies to be ready to support. Longshot is at (5,5) adjacent to me, Phantom is at (2,2). Moving toward center to stay near allies while keeping distance from enemies. I'll use overclock on Longshot since they're a striker who can benefit greatly from an extra action — but Longshot is at dist=2, so I need to get adjacent first. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer. Actually, Longshot is at (5,5) and I'm at (3,5) — dist=2, not adjacent. I can move to (4,5) to get adjacent to Longshot, then use overclock on them.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, time to cloak immediately per orders. Both enemies are far away (dist 7-8). After cloaking, I'll advance toward Patch (the medic) at (4,5). Moving to (2,3) gets me closer while staying covered.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 6, out of my range 2. I need to advance. Moving to (5,3) gets me closer while staying away from enemies. Still out of range after moving. I have 2 ability uses but no targets in range, so I'll wait on abilities.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) E ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Longshot at (5,3), distance 4. I need to advance toward them. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while staying in range to intercept allies if needed. Enemies are to my north/east, so shield_wall facing E covers Longshot's direction.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, starting at (4,0). Enemies are Longshot at (5,3) and Patch at (4,5). I should move forward to control the center and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (4,1) puts me closer to center. Then I'll place a trap at (4,2) — between my position and the enemies — to intercept Longshot or Patch as they advance. That tile is within 2 range from (4,1). This creates a denial zone and forces enemies to route around.
  State: Aegis 8/8, Veil 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Phantom 4/4, Patch 12/12, Longshot 4/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has only 1 turn remaining — I need to use it wisely. I can't reach behind Aegis or Weaver this turn. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Aegis at dist=1, setting up shadow_strike next turn while still cloaked. Weaver is at dist=3 so I won't trigger denial. After moving, I'll shadow_strike Aegis if adjacent, but from (3,2) Aegis is at (4,2) — dist=1, adjacent! I can shadow_strike to deal damage and stay cloaked. That's the play.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. I'm behind Phantom — position (2,2) is directly behind them (they face E) and is adjacent. I can move to (2,2) and then use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while maintaining cloak. This is ideal — hit Phantom while staying invisible for potential breach next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → patch(5,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is at 3/4 HP (dist=4) and Longshot is at 4/5 HP (dist=3). Longshot is closer and wounded. I need to move toward Longshot to heal. From (4,5), moving to (4,3) gets me dist=1 from Longshot at (5,3) — adjacent. Valid moves include (4,3). From (4,3) I can heal Longshot. No enemies are adjacent so patch is not blocked.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis (sentinel) is at dist=2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved, so I get full 2dmg. No enemy medic visible. Aegis is closest threat at dist=2. Fire precision_shot on Aegis, then wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,2) ✗ Position occupied → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Patch and Phantom are both at range 2. I'm at (4,1) facing N. Patch is at (4,3) — directly north 2 tiles. Phantom is at (3,2) — adjacent diagonal. My denial passive blocks adjacent enemies, but neither is adjacent yet. I should place a trap to control the approach path. Moving to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Longshot's column and lets me trap (4,2) where Aegis is — bad idea. Better: move to (3,1) to get adjacent to Phantom (denying their cloak), then trap (3,2) or (4,2) as a chokepoint. Actually Phantom is already at (3,2) so I can't trap occupied tiles. I'll move to (5,1) to flank and place a trap at (4,2) — the tile between enemies and my position, which Patch or Longshot might cross. Or stay and trap (3,0) or (5,0) as approach denial. Best play: move to (5,2) to be adjacent to Longshot at (5,3) — denying some abilities — then I'm also near Patch. Actually move to (4,0) keeps distance and I can trap (4,2) to block Patch's advance toward my backline. Let me trap (5,2) — a likely movement corridor for Longshot approaching.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) W ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent: Phantom at (3,2) and Patch at (4,3). Orders say attack if adjacent. Patch is a medic — high priority. I'm fortified so staying put keeps 50% damage reduction. Attack Patch first, then use shield_wall facing North where enemies cluster (Phantom to W, Patch to N).
  State: Aegis 6/8, Veil 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Phantom 3/4, Patch 10/12, Longshot 5/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Veil is the enemy specter — priority target as damage dealer. She's at (2,2) facing S, so (2,3) is behind her and reachable. I can move to (2,3) then use breach to take control of her. This also keeps me away from Weaver's denial range. Breach cooldown is ready and I have 0/2 used.
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (2,2), allies are at (4,2) and (5,1) — so I should move west/left toward the edge. Valid moves include (0,2) which is the far west edge, directly away from allies and enemies. I'll move there in two steps: first to (1,2) then (0,2), or directly to (0,2) if within range. Distance from (2,2) to (0,2) is 2 tiles — within my move of 3. I can reach (0,2) in one move action.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is at (2,3) with 3/4 HP and needs healing. I'm at (4,3), dist=2, so not adjacent yet. Aegis is adjacent at (4,2) — I need to move away from Aegis and toward Phantom. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Phantom (dist=1) without being adjacent to Aegis. Then from (3,3) I still can't reach Phantom for patch (dist=1, need adjacent). Wait — dist=1 means 1 tile away, which IS adjacent. So move to (3,3) and then patch Phantom at (2,3).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both Aegis and Weaver are in range at distance 2. Neither is wounded, so I should target the enemy medic — but there's no medic visible. Both targets are healthy. I'll use precision_shot on Aegis (sentinel) since it's a tankier class worth chipping down. I must NOT move adjacent to Weaver at (5,1) — staying at (5,3) keeps me at distance 2 from Weaver, which is safe. I'll stay put and fire.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (5,3), dist=2 and in range. I'm at (5,1). I can move to (5,2) to get adjacent and use denial to block Longshot's precision_shot, then attack. Or place a trap on (5,2) to intercept Longshot if they advance. Moving to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (5,3), enabling denial passive and an attack. That's the aggressive play — deny their key ability and deal damage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Nearest enemies are Patch at (3,3) dist=2 and Longshot at (5,3) dist=2. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Moving to (3,2) gets me adjacent to Patch at (3,3). Valid moves include (3,2). After moving I lose fortify, so use shield_wall facing N (toward the cluster of enemies at y=3) to protect against incoming fire.
  State: Aegis 5/8, Veil 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Phantom 4/4, Patch 10/12, Longshot 4/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (0,2) on the west edge already. Moving south toward (0,0) corner takes me away from enemies clustered around y=3. Move to (0,0) — farthest from all enemies and allies.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → patch(5,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded at 4/5 HP and is 2 tiles away. I need to move closer to heal. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (5,3) — dist=1, enabling patch. Aegis sentinel is at (3,2) which is 1 tile south of me, moving east to (4,3) keeps me safe. Weaver is at (5,2), dist=2 from (4,3) — not adjacent so abilities won't be blocked. After moving to (4,3), I'll patch Longshot.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Aegis is at (3,2) facing W — I need to get to (4,2) to be behind them, which is reachable. Move to (4,2) first, then I'll be adjacent and behind Aegis. From there I can shadow_strike to deal damage without breaking cloak. Orders say to use breach on sentinels — but breach has 1 turn cooldown remaining, so I'll position behind Aegis now and shadow_strike for damage.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver at (5,2) which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first. Valid moves include (5,4) and (5,5) which keep distance, or (3,3) which gets closer to Aegis (wounded, dist 3). Moving to (3,3) puts Aegis at dist 1 — too close. Moving to (5,5) increases distance from everyone. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist 2 from Aegis — in range for precision_shot without being adjacent. After moving to (4,4), Aegis at (3,2) is dist ~2.8 — still out of range 2. Let me check: dist from (4,4) to (3,2) = sqrt(1+4) ~2.2, out of range. From (3,3) to (3,2) = dist 1, adjacent — bad. Best move: (5,4) keeps distance from Weaver (dist 2), then Aegis is still out of range. Or move to (4,4): Weaver at (5,2) is dist ~2.2, not adjacent, so precision_shot unblocked, but Aegis still out of range at ~2.8. I should move away from Weaver and use basic attack on Weaver as it's the only enemy in range — but orders say stay max range. Move to (5,5) to escape denial zone, then wait since no valid targets in range.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(5,2) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,2) - my Denial passive already blocks their cloak. I should pulse to hit both Phantom and Patch who are within 1 tile. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile of me, and Phantom is at dist=1. Patch is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach them. After pulsing Phantom, I can move north to (5,3) to set a trap on (5,4) cutting off Longshot's approach path from (5,5).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) E ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,2). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified which gives 50% damage reduction, but attacking means I'll move/act and lose fortify next turn. Still, orders are clear: attack adjacent enemy. I'll attack Phantom first, then use shield_wall facing East where both Phantom and Patch are clustered.
  State: Aegis 4/8, Veil 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Phantom 2/4, Patch 10/12, Longshot 5/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I'm adjacent to Weaver's denial zone, so all abilities are blocked anyway. Phantom is critically wounded at 2/4 HP but I can't heal. I need to escape Weaver's denial zone to potentially use overclock, but patch is gone so that's less urgent. Priority: move away from Weaver to safety. Moving to (3,3) gets me away from Weaver and closer to allies. Then wait since abilities are limited.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) behind Aegis who faces W — breach cooldown ready. Aegis is wounded, so breach would let me control them next turn to attack allies. But orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer. Weaver (vector) is the damage dealer at (5,3), and (5,2) is behind Weaver and reachable. However I'm at 2HP — risky to get adjacent to Weaver. Aegis is adjacent and wounded — shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1dmg. If Aegis is on low HP, shadow_strike could finish them. Aegis is 'wounded' so likely low HP. Shadow_strike from current position hits adjacent Aegis at (3,2), keeps cloak, then I can move to (5,2) to get behind Weaver for next turn breach. Wait — I should shadow_strike Aegis first (keeps cloak), then move toward Weaver. Shadow_strike is adjacent-only and Aegis is adjacent. This eliminates a wounded enemy and keeps me cloaked for next turn setup on Weaver.
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (0,0) which is already a corner. Valid moves include going up along the west edge or east along the south edge. Moving to (0,3) gets me to the north edge of the west side, away from combat cluster near center. Actually, I should move toward an edge away from the action — allies are at (3,2) and (5,3), enemies at (3,3), (5,2), (5,5). Moving along the west edge northward keeps me away. Max move is 3 tiles. I'll move to (0,3) to hug the west wall away from combat.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver(vector) is at (5,3), dist=2, in range. I'm at (5,5). Weaver is healthy so not a kill shot priority, but orders say target most wounded enemy — Aegis is wounded but out of range at dist=5. No wounded enemies in range. Weaver is the only target in range. I must NOT move adjacent to Weaver (currently at dist=2, which is safe). precision_shot requires LoS and works at ≤2 tiles — Weaver is exactly 2 tiles away. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire precision_shot on Weaver, then wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (5,2) — wounded, so attack to pressure or finish. Longshot is at (5,5) dist=2, I could move to (5,4) to deny Longshot abilities and stay in range. But first priority: attack wounded Phantom adjacent to me, then move to (5,4) to threaten Longshot and deny their abilities.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent to the north at (3,3). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified so I want to stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Patch first, then use shield_wall facing N/E where enemies are concentrated (Patch north, Phantom east).
  State: Aegis 3/8, Veil 4/4, Weaver 7/9, Phantom 1/4, Patch 9/12, Longshot 5/5

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/4) so I need to play carefully. Aegis is wounded and 2 tiles away - I can breach from behind at (4,2) which is adjacent and behind Aegis (facing W). Moving to (4,2) puts me behind Aegis for a breach. Weaver is nearby at (5,4) but I'm not going adjacent to them. Moving to (4,2) keeps me away from Weaver's adjacent denial range. A breach on wounded Aegis would be devastating - they'd obey me next turn. This is high value at low risk since I approach from behind.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is at (3,3) facing W — closest high-value target at dist 3. I'm at (0,3). Moving toward Patch: max move is 3 tiles, so I can reach (2,3) or (3,3). Patch is at (3,3) so I can move adjacent to (2,3) without entering their tile, then shadow_strike from adjacent. Actually I can move to (2,3) which is dist=1 from Patch at (3,3) — that's adjacent! Then shadow_strike for 1 dmg while staying cloaked. Wait — am I still cloaked? The system prompt doesn't indicate I'm cloaked currently. Round 6, tip says focus on offense. I'll move to (2,3) to get adjacent to Patch, then shadow_strike them.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → overclock(4,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Phantom is at dist=2 with 1HP — I can't heal anyway. Veil (enemy specter) is adjacent at (2,3), Aegis (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (3,2). I need to move away from enemies. I can use overclock on Phantom if I get adjacent, but Phantom is at (4,2) with 1HP — too risky to move toward enemies. Best play: move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Phantom and use overclock so Phantom can act twice next turn. That moves me away from Veil at (2,3) and keeps distance from Weaver at (5,4) — (4,3) is dist=1 from Weaver... wait, Weaver is at (5,4), dist from (4,3) = |5-4|+|4-3| = 2, safe. Overclock Phantom at (4,2) from (4,3).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (5,4) — denial zone blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first. Valid moves: (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3). Moving to (4,4) puts me at distance 2 from Weaver — still adjacent diagonally, risky. Moving to (3,5) gives distance 2 (Manhattan), possibly safe. Moving to (4,5) keeps me at distance 2 from Weaver at (5,4) — diagonal, dist=1 Chebyshev but dist=2 Manhattan. Best: move to (3,5) to escape denial zone, then attack Weaver with precision_shot if in range. From (3,5) to Weaver (5,4): dist = |5-3|+|4-5| = 2+1 = 3 — out of range 2. From (4,5) to Weaver (5,4): dist = 1+1 = 2 — in range, but still adjacent Chebyshev. From (5,3) to Weaver (5,4): dist = 1 — still adjacent. Best escape is (3,5) but Weaver is out of range. Alternatively (4,4): dist to Weaver = 1+0 = 1, still adjacent. Only (3,5) truly escapes Weaver adjacency (Chebyshev dist = max(2,1)=2). From (3,5): Aegis at (3,2) dist=3, Veil at (2,3) dist=3, Weaver at (5,4) dist=3 — all out of range 2. I should move to (3,5) to escape denial and use attack on Weaver since no ability targets are in range after move — actually from any valid move tile, no enemy is in range 2 except via attack. Wait — from (4,5), Weaver at (5,4) is Chebyshev=1 adjacent, Manhattan=2. Precision_shot requires range≤2 tiles and no adjacency to enemy Vector. Moving to (4,5) still leaves me adjacent to Weaver (a Vector), blocking precision_shot. Best: move to (3,5), Weaver now at distance 3 — out of range for any shot. No good shot available this turn. Move to (3,5) and wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent at dist=2, within my denial passive range if I get closer. I should place a trap between enemy positions to control the chokepoint. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Patch, activating denial to block their patch ability, and I can trap tile (3,4) to block Longshot's approach path toward our allies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, facing away from the team. Allies are to my west and northwest. The eastern/southern edges are away from them. Moving to (5,2) gets me to the eastern edge. From there I face east, away from the team.
  State: Aegis 3/8, Veil 4/4, Weaver 7/9, Patch 8/12, Longshot 5/5 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is at (4,3) facing E, so I'm behind them if I'm at (3,3). I can move to (3,3) which is adjacent and behind Patch. Then use breach to take control of Patch next turn — forcing the enemy medic to act against their team. This is the highest-value play available.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say to move away from allies and attack own units. Longshot is my ally at (3,5). I should move toward Longshot and attack them. Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Longshot at (3,5) dist=1. Then I can attack Longshot.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both Veil and Weaver are in range at distance 2, but both are healthy. Aegis is wounded but out of range at dist 5. Orders say target the most wounded enemy; since no one is wounded among those in range, and there's no enemy medic visible, I'll prioritize Veil (specter) with precision_shot. I'm stationary so full 2dmg applies. Must not move adjacent to Weaver. Current position (3,5) is safe. Fire precision_shot at Veil (3,3) without moving.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, facing away from team. I'm at (5,2) facing E. Allies are to my west/northwest. Moving to (5,0) gets me to the southern edge, maximizing distance from allies at (3,3) and (4,4). Then wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(3,4) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent at (3,4) - my Denial passive blocks their patch ability. Longshot is at (3,5) within range 2. I should attack Patch (already wounded, finish them) then place a trap on a chokepoint. Actually, pulse would hit Patch (dist 1) for 1 dmg. Attack hits adjacent Patch for 1 dmg. Patch is wounded so either could help finish them. I'll attack Patch first (adjacent, 1 dmg), then place a trap at (3,5) to threaten Longshot's position - wait, trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but I'm a Vector adjacent to Patch (enemy), so trap is blocked. I'll use pulse instead as second action - hits all within 1 tile, so hits Patch (dist 1) for 1 dmg. Attack + pulse = 2 dmg on Patch. That's solid pressure.
  State: Aegis 3/8, Veil 2/4, Weaver 7/9, Patch 5/12, Longshot 4/5 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 8 — player
- **Patch** (medic): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I have no patch uses left. I need to act defensively and support my team. Veil is adjacent to the south at (3,3) and Weaver is adjacent at (4,4). I can attack Veil who is wounded to help finish them off. I'll attack Veil first, then move away from Weaver's denial zone toward a safer position.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Patch is wounded and I'm behind them from (3,4). I can move to (3,4) which is adjacent and behind Patch, then shadow_strike for 1 damage. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak (but I'm not cloaked). At 1HP I need to eliminate Patch fast before they heal anyone. Move to (3,4), then shadow_strike Patch at (2,4).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil(specter) is critical and only 1 tile away at (3,4). I can use precision_shot but I need LoS and I must not have moved. Veil is adjacent (dist=1) — wait, precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles but the WARNING says it's blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Veil is a specter, not a vector. Weaver(vector) is at (4,4) dist=2, not adjacent. So precision_shot is NOT blocked. Veil is at dist=1, within range=2. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Veil is critical — 2dmg should finish them. Use precision_shot on Veil first, then wait (no need to move, staying at range).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, facing away from team. I'm at (5,0) facing S. Moving to (5,2) gets me further from allies at (4,4) and toward the south edge. Then wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → pulse(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both Patch and Longshot are within range 2. Patch is wounded at (2,4) - same row, 2 tiles west. Longshot is healthy at (3,5). I can pulse from current position to hit Patch since pulse hits all within 1 tile - but Patch is 2 away so pulse won't reach. I can move to (3,4) to get adjacent to Patch (2 tiles away becomes 1), enabling pulse to hit Patch. From (3,4), Longshot at (3,5) would be 1 tile away too - pulse could hit both! Move to (3,4) then pulse to hit both Patch and Longshot. This denies Patch's healing abilities via adjacency denial too.
  State: Aegis 3/8, Weaver 7/9, Patch 3/12, Longshot 3/5 | Dead: Veil, Phantom

### Turn 9 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I have no heals left and am adjacent to Weaver (denial zone blocks abilities). Orders say to move away from allies and attack own units. Longshot is at (3,5) dist=2, not adjacent. I should move toward Longshot to get adjacent, then attack them. Move to (3,5) is not in valid moves, but (3,3) gets me closer. Actually let me check: valid moves include (3,3) and (4,4) etc. I need to get adjacent to Longshot at (3,5). Valid moves show (4,5) is available - that puts me dist=1 from Longshot at (3,5). Then I can attack Longshot. But wait - moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Longshot. After moving, Weaver denial won't apply (I'll be away from Weaver). So: move to (4,5), then attack Longshot at (3,5).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver (vector) at (3,4), which means my precision_shot is blocked by DENIAL. I need to move away first. Valid moves: [1,5],[2,4],[2,5],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]. I need to get away from Weaver (3,4) and ideally into range of Aegis (5,2). Moving to (5,5) puts me dist=1 from Weaver still adjacent? No - (5,5) to (3,4) is dist=3, safe. But Aegis is at (5,2), dist from (5,5) would be 3 - still out of range 2. Move to (4,4): dist to Weaver=(3,4) is 1+0=1, still adjacent - bad. Move to (2,5): dist to Weaver is 1+1=2, not adjacent, safe. From (2,5) Aegis at (5,2) is dist=6, too far. From (5,5) Weaver at (3,4) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, not adjacent. Best move away from denial while keeping options: go to (5,5) - not adjacent to Weaver. From there Aegis still out of range. After moving to (5,5), Weaver is at dist ~2.24 (not adjacent), so precision_shot unblocked. Weaver is healthy at dist ~2.24 from (5,5) - out of range 2. Only Aegis at dist 3 - also out of range. No targets in range after move. Use suppressing_fire on Weaver? After moving to (2,5), Weaver at (3,4) is 1+1=2 tiles away, in range 2. Precision_shot not blocked (not adjacent). Weaver is healthy, Aegis is wounded but too far. Orders say use precision_shot on most wounded - Aegis is wounded but unreachable. Weaver is in range from (2,5). Move to (2,5), then precision_shot Weaver (I haven't moved more than needed, but I did move so it's 1dmg instead of 2). Actually from (2,5) I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg. Better: move to (2,4)? dist to Weaver (3,4)=1, adjacent - bad. Move to (1,5): Weaver dist=2+1=3, not adjacent, safe. From (1,5) Weaver at (3,4): dist=sqrt(4+1)~2.24, out of range. Stick with (2,5): Weaver dist=sqrt(1+1)~1.41 - that's 1 tile diag? Game likely uses Manhattan: |3-2|+|4-5|=1+1=2, range 2, in range, not adjacent (adjacent=dist 1). Precision_shot at Weaver from (2,5) for 1dmg (moved). This damages Weaver and follows orders to attack enemies in range.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Both enemies are to the north. Patch is at (4,5) distance 4, Longshot at (2,5) distance 6. I need to advance toward Patch (nearest enemy). Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying in valid moves. No enemies adjacent so no attack possible. Use shield_wall facing N toward enemies after moving.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → pulse(3,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is critical at (4,5) distance 2 - pulse would hit them if I move adjacent. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Patch and still near Longshot. From (3,5), pulse at range 1 hits Patch at (4,5) (dist=1 diagonal? No - dist is Manhattan: |4-3|+|5-5|=1, yes adjacent). Longshot at (2,5) would be dist=1 from (3,5) too. Both enemies within 1 tile of (3,5)! Move to (3,5) then pulse to hit both critical/wounded enemies.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at 2HP with no heals left, adjacent to Weaver's denial zone which blocks my abilities. I need to escape Weaver to potentially use overclock, but with 0 patch uses left that doesn't matter much. Longshot is at 1HP and needs help but I can't heal. Best move: escape Weaver's denial zone and get to safety. Move to (5,5) to escape denial, then use overclock on Longshot if adjacent isn't possible. Actually Longshot is at (2,5) dist=2, not adjacent. I should move away from Weaver to survive. Move to (5,4) to escape denial zone - Weaver is at (3,5), moving to (5,4) puts dist=2+. Then I could attack Aegis at (4,3) which would be dist=1 from (5,4). With 2HP I'm almost dead, so surviving matters. Move to (5,4), then basic attack Aegis at (4,3) to help finish them off.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(1,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 1HP, adjacent to Weaver's denial zone which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away from Weaver first to escape the denial zone, then use precision_shot. Moving to (0,5) puts me 3 tiles from Weaver (outside denial) and still lets me potentially shoot. Actually, valid moves show (0,5) is reachable. After moving to (0,5), Weaver is at (3,5) = distance 3, out of my range-2 for precision_shot. Aegis is at (4,3), dist=5 from (0,5), also out of range. I have 1HP so survival is critical. Best play: move to (0,5) to escape denial zone, then wait since no targets in range. Alternatively move to (1,5) - Weaver at dist=2, but still need LoS and no denial. From (1,5), Weaver is at distance 2 - in range for precision_shot if denial is cleared. Moving away from Weaver first action breaks denial adjacency. After move to (0,5), I'm at distance 3 from Weaver - out of my range 2. No shot available. Move to (1,5): distance 2 from Weaver, within range, denial zone cleared after moving. Fire precision_shot on Weaver.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(1,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critical at dist=2 and already acted. Patch is critical at dist=3. I should finish Longshot with attack (adjacent range only, dist=2 - not adjacent). Longshot is at (1,5), I'm at (3,5) - dist=2, not adjacent. I can move to (2,5) to get adjacent, then attack Longshot to finish them. This also keeps me away from Patch at (5,4). After killing Longshot, Patch is isolated and wounded.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is at (5,4), distance 2 to my east-northeast. I need to advance to get adjacent. Moving to (5,3) puts me adjacent to Patch at (5,4) — that's 1 tile north. Valid moves include (5,3). After moving there, I can attack Patch who will be adjacent to the north.
