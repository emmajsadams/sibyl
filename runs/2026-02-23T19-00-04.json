Best approach: move to (1,5) puts me at dist sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 from Insight, but shadow_strike requires adjacent only. I need to be at (0,3),(0,5),(1,4) to be adjacent to Insight at (0,4). (0,3) is where Rampart is. (0,5) — is that a valid move? It's not in my valid tiles list. (1,4) is valid but Patch is there.

My priority: move away from Rampart to avoid another attack, then use scan on Veil to track them (specters go invisible).
