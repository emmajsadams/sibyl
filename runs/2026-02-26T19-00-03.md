## Squads
### Player
- **Doc** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Viper** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
### Opponent
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Doc (the medic) at (2,1), moving to (4,1) to close distance while cloaked. Viper is at (4,0) with denial range adjacent, so I'll stay at (4,1) to avoid being adjacent to Viper while cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Hawk at (1,4). Max move toward target while cloaked.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are 4 tiles away. I should advance to get closer to Ghost (my frontliner at (1,3)) so I can support with patch or overclock next turn. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Ghost and in position to overclock or heal. No ability needed this turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is in range at dist=2. Priority target per orders. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. If I shoot first without moving, I deal 2dmg. I'll use precision_shot on Doc, then wait — no need to move since Doc is already in range and I want to maintain distance.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at distance 7. I should move forward and place a trap on a likely approach path. Enemies at (1,4) and (2,5) will likely move south toward our backline. Moving to (4,2) gets me into better position, then I'll place a trap at (3,1) to cover the central corridor they'd need to cross.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → pulse(2,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is 2 tiles away at (2,3) - within my range. I'm a Vector with Denial passive, so if I move adjacent to Doc I'll block some of their abilities. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Doc, enabling Denial. Then I can place a trap between Doc and our backline, or pulse Doc directly. Actually, pulse hits all units within 1 tile - if I'm at (2,4), Doc at (2,3) is adjacent, so pulse hits them for 1dmg. But I only have attack range adjacent. Let me move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Doc and enable Denial, then pulse to hit Doc for 1 damage.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Viper 9/9, Doc 14/16, Hawk 3/4, Wraith 4/4, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. Hawk is adjacent at (1,4) facing S — I'm not behind them yet. I can move to (1,5) which is behind Hawk, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Weaver is at distance 2 so breach is blocked anyway. Priority: get behind Hawk and shadow_strike.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities including patch and overclock. All allies are at full HP anyway, so no healing needed. I need to escape Weaver's denial zone to restore my ability access. Moving to (1,3) puts me 2 away from Weaver, out of denial, and keeps me near the action. From there I could overclock or patch next turn if needed. No healing targets exist right now.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, currently at (4,1) which is directly behind Viper at (4,2) facing N. Viper's denial zone blocks cloak/breach abilities while adjacent. I need to move away from Viper's denial zone first, then breach. But wait — I'm already behind Viper and breach is blocked by denial. My cloak expires after this turn anyway. Best play: use shadow_strike on Viper (keeps cloak, 1dmg, adjacent) since shadow_strike is NOT blocked by denial per the rules (only cloak/breach are blocked). Then move toward Doc. Actually re-reading: denial blocks cloak/breach but NOT shadow_strike or basic attack. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 dmg. Use shadow_strike on Viper now, then move toward Doc to pressure next turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(0,4) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with 2HP, surrounded by enemies Ghost at (1,5) and Doc at (1,3) — both adjacent. precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Orders say medics first. I need to move away to get range, then use precision_shot on Doc. Moving to (2,3) puts me at dist 1 from Doc (still adjacent) — not ideal. Moving to (0,3) gets me away from Ghost but still adjacent to Doc. Best option: move to (2,5) which is dist 2 from Doc at (1,3) and dist ~1 from Ghost at (1,5). Actually let me check: (2,5) to Doc(1,3) = |2-1|+|5-3|=3, out of range. (0,3) to Doc(1,3) = dist 1, still adjacent. (2,3) to Doc(1,3) = dist 1. (0,5) to Ghost(1,5) = dist 1. (3,4) to Doc(1,3) = |3-1|+|4-3|=3, out of range too far. (1,2) to Doc(1,3) = dist 1. Try (2,5): dist to Ghost(1,5)=1, still adjacent. Move to (0,4): not in valid moves list. Valid tiles: [0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[2,3],[2,5],[3,4]. Wait - (0,4) is listed! dist from (0,4) to Doc(1,3)=|0-1|+|4-3|=2, not adjacent, can use precision_shot! dist to Ghost(1,5)=|0-1|+|4-5|=2, not adjacent either. Perfect. Move to (0,4) then precision_shot Doc.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (3,3), distance 2 — within my attack/trap range. A trap already sits at (3,1). Weaver is at (2,4) and will move toward our backline. I should place a trap on a likely approach path to cut off Weaver or Wraith. (3,2) is between me and Wraith and on a natural approach path — good trap placement. Then I'll use pulse on Wraith since it's adjacent-range only and Wraith is at dist 2, not adjacent. Actually pulse requires within 1 tile AoE — Wraith at dist 2 is not in pulse range. Best play: place trap at (3,2) to threaten Wraith's advance, then move to (4,3) to stay at medium range and keep denial pressure. Wait — I'm currently not adjacent to any enemy so trap is not blocked by Denial. Place trap at (3,2) first, then move north to (4,3) to maintain range and watch the field.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(1,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is at (1,5) dist=2 and Doc is at (1,3) dist=2, both in range. I'm at (2,4). I should place a trap between enemy positions to control movement. Moving to (3,4) puts me further from Doc and Ghost but keeps distance from Viper. Better to stay at (2,4) or move to (2,5) to place a trap at (1,4) — a chokepoint between Ghost at (1,5) and Doc at (1,3) that enemies might move through. Actually, placing trap at (2,3) or (1,4) would be good chokepoints. I can't trap adjacent to Viper (dist=3, safe). Ghost is at (1,5), Doc at (1,3) — tile (1,4) is between them and empty. I can trap (1,4) from my current position at (2,4) — dist=1 tile away, within range 2. Then move to (3,4) to avoid being adjacent to Ghost.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Viper 8/9, Doc 13/16, Hawk 2/4, Wraith 4/4, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded at (4,3) but dist=3, not adjacent so can't heal yet. Ghost is full HP, don't heal. No adjacent allies to overclock. Hawk is wounded at (0,4) dist=2 but I'm a medic not a striker. Best move: advance toward Viper to get in healing range. Move to (2,3) gets me closer to Viper (dist=2), still safe from Weaver at (3,4). Then wait.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → breach(0,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and I can reach (1,4) which is behind them (adjacent). Move there then use breach to take control — that wastes their turn and removes a wounded attacker from play. I must stay 2+ tiles from Weaver to avoid ability denial.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper (denial zone) and Doc. I can't use breach/cloak while in denial zone. Best play: move to (4,2) to get behind Viper, escaping denial zone, then breach Viper to take control of that vector and neutralize the denial threat. Alternatively, shadow_strike Doc since I'm adjacent — but breach on Viper is higher value (removes denial, controls their vector). Move to (4,2) first (behind Viper, exits denial), then breach Viper.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (1,4), which blocks precision_shot. Orders say move to corner at (0,5) or (0,3). I'll move to (0,5) to get distance from Ghost, then wait since I'm at 2HP and need to avoid further damage.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,2) — immediate threat. I can pulse to hit Wraith (dist 1) without moving. Weaver is at (3,4) dist 2, not adjacent so my Denial is active on Wraith. After pulsing Wraith, I should move to (5,3) to maintain medium range, keep distance from Weaver (avoid going adjacent), and set up trap coverage on enemy approach paths.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is at (1,4) dist=2 and Doc is at (2,3) dist=2, both in range. I'm at (3,4). I should place a trap between enemy positions to control the area. Doc at (2,3) is likely to move toward allies - placing a trap at (2,4) would intercept movement between Ghost and Doc toward our side. Then I can move to (4,4) to stay safe from Viper's denial range while maintaining pressure. Trap first at (2,4) to block the corridor, then move east toward (4,4) to keep distance from Viper.
  State: Ghost 3/4, Viper 8/9, Doc 13/16, Hawk 2/4, Wraith 3/4, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → attack(0,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and I'm already behind them (facing N, behind tiles are [0,4] which is reachable). Breach is on cooldown so I can't use it. I can move to (0,4) which is adjacent and behind Hawk, then use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked — but I'm not cloaked. I could use attack instead. Moving to (0,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk for an attack. That's the best play: close in and attack the wounded target. Weaver at (4,4) is 3 tiles away so not adjacent, no denial issue at (0,4).
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → patch(0,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critically wounded at 3/4 HP at (0,4), dist=3. Viper is wounded at 8/9 HP at (5,3), dist=3. Ghost needs healing more urgently (only 3HP, one hit from death). I should move toward Ghost to get adjacent and heal. Moving to (1,4) gets me dist=1 from Ghost at (0,4), which is adjacent. Then I can patch Ghost next turn, or if I can reach adjacent this turn, heal now. From (1,4), Ghost at (0,4) would be adjacent. Let me move to (1,4) first, then check if patch is usable. After moving to (1,4), Ghost is adjacent - I can patch Ghost for 2HP heal.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → breach(5,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Viper is 2 tiles away at (5,3) facing E — I'm already behind them. Moving to (4,3) puts me directly behind Viper (adjacent), which is the breach tile. Breach cooldown is ready and this is a high-value target (vector denial zone). Breaching Viper removes their zone control and lets me dictate their next turn. Move to (4,3) then breach Viper. Addendum: order Viper to move away from the fight toward (5,5) or wait — reducing their denial threat.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → suppressing_fire(1,4) E ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,5) with 1HP, Ghost is adjacent at (0,4). Orders say move toward corner at (0,5) or (0,3). I'm already at (0,5). Valid moves include (0,3). Ghost is adjacent which blocks precision_shot. I can move to (0,3) to get away from Ghost, then use suppressing_fire on Doc at (1,4) to slow them, or attack Ghost if adjacent. Moving to (0,3) puts me 1 tile from Ghost still but follows orders. Actually I should move to (0,3) per orders, then Ghost is at dist=2 so precision_shot unblocked - I can fire on Ghost for 2dmg (but I moved so 1dmg). Better: suppressing_fire on Doc at (1,4) from (0,3) - dist=2, within range.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(5,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,3) - perfect pulse target. Weaver is at (4,4) which is also within pulse range (1 tile AoE from my position at 5,3). Pulsing now hits both Wraith and Weaver for 1 damage each. After pulse, move to (5,4) to maintain distance from Weaver and avoid moving adjacent to it. Wraith is healthy so pulse won't finish it but chips both enemies.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper at (5,4) with DENIAL blocking my trap ability. Viper is healthy and adjacent - I should attack it for 1dmg. Wraith ally is at (4,3) wounded and Hawk is critical at (0,3). After attacking Viper, I can move to (5,5) or (5,3) to maintain denial pressure on Viper, or move away to place a trap. Since trap is blocked by adjacency to Viper, I should attack Viper first, then move to (5,3) to stay adjacent and keep denial active while shifting position slightly.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Viper 7/9, Doc 12/16, Hawk 1/4, Wraith 2/4, Weaver 9/9

### Turn 5 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): attack(0,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is critical health, adjacent at (0,3), and I'm already behind them (behindTiles=[0,4] = my position). Breach is ready and would let me control Hawk next turn — but Hawk is critical, so killing them now is better. Use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked... wait, I'm not cloaked. Use regular attack instead to finish off the critical Hawk. I'm adjacent and behind them. Attack is the cleanest play to eliminate them this turn.
- **Doc** (medic): patch(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so movement is limited to 1 tile. Ghost is adjacent at (2,4) with only 3/4 HP - wounded and needs heal. I'm at (1,4) and Ghost is at (2,4), so Ghost is adjacent to me. I should patch Ghost to keep the frontliner alive per orders. After healing, I can move to stay behind them or wait.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/4 HP and need to be careful. Ghost is at (2,4) facing E, Doc is at (1,4) facing N. I can reach (1,3) which is behind Doc and adjacent to Doc. That's the perfect breach or shadow_strike position. Move to (1,3) then shadow_strike Doc while cloaked (if still cloaked) or just attack. Wait - I need to check if I'm still cloaked. No cloak status shown, so I'm not cloaked. I should move toward Doc - (1,3) is reachable and puts me behind Doc, adjacent for shadow_strike. That's 3 tiles: (4,3)→(3,3)→(2,3)→(1,3). Then shadow_strike Doc from behind.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(5,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (5,3) — I'm in denial zone, so trap is blocked. I can still attack or pulse. Pulse hits all within 1 tile: Weaver is at dist 1, so pulse hits Weaver for 1dmg. Then I should reposition away from Weaver to escape denial zone and set traps next turn. Move to (4,5) gets me out of Weaver's denial zone while staying near allies.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✗ Cannot use trap — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Viper is at (4,5) distance 3 to my north. Ghost is at (2,4) moving east. I should place a trap between enemy positions and my ally Wraith at (1,3). Moving to (4,4) brings me closer to Viper (potentially blocking abilities via denial next turn) and lets me place a trap at (3,4) or (3,3) to intercept Ghost moving east toward our side. Let me move to (4,4) then trap at (3,4) — this is between Ghost at (2,4) and our territory, and within my 2-tile trap range.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Viper 7/9, Doc 11/16, Wraith 2/4, Weaver 8/9 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 6 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(1,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is wounded and I'm already behind it (facing W, I'm to its E). I can move to (2,3) which is adjacent and behind Wraith, then use breach to take control of it. This wastes the wounded Wraith's next turn and sets up a shadow_strike follow-up. Weaver is nearby but breach cooldown is ready and Wraith is the priority target since it's wounded.
- **Doc** (medic): attack(1,3) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded — but I only have 1 heal left and Viper (7/9) also needs it. Ghost is full HP. Priority: don't waste my last patch on the wrong target. Wraith is an enemy specter, not an ally — can't heal enemies. My allies needing heal: Viper at dist=4, not adjacent. Ghost is full HP. No adjacent wounded ally to heal. Wraith being adjacent means my abilities could be blocked... wait, the caution says Weaver (vector) blocks abilities, not Wraith (specter). Wraith is at dist=1 but is a specter, not a vector — no ability denial. So I can still use abilities. Best play: attack Wraith (wounded enemy adjacent) to potentially finish it, then move to better position. Or move away from Wraith and wait. Orders say keep frontliner alive with patch — but no adjacent wounded ally right now. I'll attack Wraith since it's wounded and adjacent, then move north to (1,5) to reposition away from the enemy.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move away from allies and waste turn. Allies are at (4,4). Moving to (0,1) takes me away from allies and wastes movement.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(3,undefined) ✗ Out of bounds
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper at (4,5), which means my trap and pulse abilities are blocked by their Denial. I can only use basic attack or move. Viper is directly north of me at dist=1. I should attack Viper since they're in range and adjacent, then move to a better position. Moving to (5,4) keeps pressure on Viper while potentially setting up a trap next turn if I can break adjacency. Actually, I should attack first then move away to break Denial so I can trap next turn. Move to (3,4) after attacking to get out of Denial range and set up trap placement.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (4,4) — I'm in its Denial zone, so trap is blocked. I can still use pulse or basic attack. Pulse hits all within 1 tile, so it would hit Weaver at dist=1. But I should move first to break adjacency if possible, then trap paths. Actually, if I move away from Weaver first (e.g. to 5,5), I exit Denial zone and can then use trap to block paths. Let me move to (5,5) to break Denial, then trap a key approach tile like (3,3) or (5,4) to deny enemy flanks.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Viper 6/9, Doc 11/16, Wraith 1/4, Weaver 8/9 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,1) with 1HP, no enemies in range. Orders say move away from allies and waste turn. Weaver is at (4,4), so I'll move toward (0,0) corner, away from allies, and wait.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 Breach is unavailable. Wraith is at critical HP but 5 tiles away. Weaver is 3 tiles away at (4,4) facing N — I can reach the behind tile at (4,3) which is adjacent and behind. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and I'm not currently cloaked, so I should move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Weaver, then shadow_strike for damage. Wait — I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't have the cloak benefit, but it still deals 1 damage and keeps cloak status if I had it. Since I'm not cloaked, I should just use regular attack or shadow_strike. Shadow_strike is still valid as an attack at adjacent range. Move to (4,3) to get behind Weaver, then shadow_strike Weaver at (4,4).
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded at (5,5) needing heal, dist=4. I can move toward Viper to get adjacent and then patch. From (1,5) moving to (4,5) gets me dist=1 from Viper at (5,5) — that's adjacent. Weaver is at (4,4) which is adjacent to (4,5), so patch would be blocked there. Move to (3,5) instead — dist from Viper is 2, not adjacent. Best reachable tile adjacent to Viper: (4,5) is reachable (in valid moves) but Weaver at (4,4) is adjacent to (4,5), blocking patch. No other tile gets me adjacent to Viper without Weaver adjacency. I'll move to (4,5) and attempt patch on Viper — wait, Weaver denial blocks patch when I'm adjacent to an enemy Vector. Weaver is at (4,4), and (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4). So patch is blocked at (4,5). I cannot reach Viper this turn without Weaver blocking. Move toward Viper as close as possible — (3,5) is safe (dist from Weaver=2, not adjacent). Next turn I may be able to reach. With 1 heal left and no safe adjacent position to Viper, I'll advance to (3,5) and wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,3) - I can pulse to hit Ghost (dist 1) and potentially Viper (dist 2, not in pulse range) or Doc (dist 2, not in pulse range). Pulse hits all within 1 tile, so only Ghost gets hit. After pulsing Ghost, I should move to (4,5) to place a trap between Doc/Viper and deny abilities. Actually, better: pulse Ghost first for 1dmg, then move to (4,5) to position between enemies. Or move first to (5,4) to be adjacent to Viper for denial, but that risks blocking my own trap ability. Stay at (4,4): pulse Ghost (1dmg), then place trap at (4,5) to block Doc/Viper approach path.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (4,5) with DENIAL active, blocking my trap ability. I can't trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector. My options: attack Weaver for 1dmg, or move away to break denial then trap. Moving to (5,3) breaks denial distance and lets me trap. But (5,4) is already trapped. Valid moves: (4,4), (5,3), (5,4) - avoid (5,4) trap. Best play: attack Weaver first for 1dmg (basic attacks still work under denial), then move to (5,3) to reposition away from denial zone.
  State: Ghost 3/4, Viper 6/9, Doc 11/16, Wraith 1/4, Weaver 6/9 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 1HP I'm extremely vulnerable. All enemies are out of range (7-8 tiles away). I should move toward the action rather than waste turns. Moving toward Ghost at (4,3) is the priority — I need to close distance to get into breach/shadow_strike range. Moving to (3,0) gets me closest while staying away from Viper's denial zone.
- **Doc** (medic): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver (denial zone), so patch/overclock are blocked. I can only attack or move. Ghost is at (4,3) with 3/4 HP - wounded and needs heal, dist=3. If I move away from Weaver's denial zone, I can potentially heal Ghost. Moving to (2,4) gets me away from Weaver and closer to Ghost. From (2,4), Ghost at (4,3) is still dist=3, not adjacent. Let me check: moving to (3,4) puts me at dist=1 from Ghost at (4,3)? No, (3,4) to (4,3) = dist 2. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Ghost at (4,3) - dist=1! And (4,4) is in my valid moves. But (4,4) is also adjacent to Weaver at (4,5) - still in denial zone. Let me think: Weaver is at (4,5), so (4,4) is adjacent to Weaver = still blocked. I need to get away from Weaver entirely. Weaver is at (4,5). Adjacent to Weaver: (3,5),(5,5),(4,4),(4,3) - wait (4,3) is Ghost's position. So (4,4) is adjacent to Weaver. Valid moves not adjacent to Weaver: (0,5),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(5,4),(5,5). From (3,4): Ghost at (4,3) = dist 2. Not adjacent. From (2,4): Ghost at (4,3) = dist 3. No good adjacent position to Ghost that's also away from Weaver. So I can't heal this turn. Best play: move away from Weaver toward allies, then attack Weaver as my second action since I'm already adjacent before moving.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,5) ✓
  💭 Weaver is wounded and I can reach the tile directly behind them (4,4) in one move. Shadow_strike works adjacent while cloaked and doesn't break cloak. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent and behind Weaver — I can shadow_strike for damage. Breach is unavailable. Wraith is at dist=4 and critical but unreachable this turn. Best play: move to (4,4) behind Weaver, then shadow_strike Weaver at (4,5).
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (4,5) wounded and 3 tiles away - I need to trap paths to slow enemies. Trap at (5,4) is already placed. I can move to (5,2) to get better positioning and place a trap to cover enemy approach routes. Wraith is at (3,0) critical and far. I should trap (4,3) or (3,3) to block central approach paths. Move to (4,3) first then trap (3,3) to cover the central corridor enemies must pass through.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,4) - I can attack for 1dmg. Viper is at dist=2 so denial doesn't affect me yet. I'm at 4/9 HP so I shouldn't be reckless. Ghost is healthy so I want to deal damage. I can attack Ghost then move to (5,5) to get some distance from the cluster at (4,3)-(3,4). Alternatively, pulse would hit Ghost at dist=1 but Viper at dist=2 is out of pulse range (pulse=1 tile AoE). Pulse only hits Ghost here. Attack also hits Ghost for 1dmg. I'll attack Ghost (adjacent, valid) then move to (5,5) to reposition away from the enemy cluster while staying in denial range of Viper if they advance.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, critical state. Weaver (vector, wounded) is at (5,5), 2 tiles away - I'm already behind them per recon. I can move to (4,5) which puts me adjacent and behind Weaver, then use shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Wraith is too far at dist=5. Breach is exhausted. Shadow_strike on wounded Weaver could finish them off. Moving to (4,5) is valid per move list.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(4,5) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critically wounded at 2/4 HP and only 2 tiles away at (4,5). I have 1 heal left and must prioritize Ghost. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to Ghost at (4,5) to use patch. Weaver is at (5,5) which is adjacent to (4,5) and (5,4) — need to check if moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Weaver. Weaver is at (5,5), I'd be at (4,4), distance is 2 — not adjacent, so abilities won't be blocked. Move to (4,4) then patch Ghost at (4,5).
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,0) with 1HP — critically low. No enemies in range. Viper is at (4,3) distance 4, Doc at (4,4) distance 5. I need to close distance but survive. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Viper while staying out of Viper's denial range (adjacent only). Best move: advance toward Viper via (4,1) or (4,2). Valid moves include (4,2). If I move to (4,2) I'll be adjacent to Viper at (4,3) next turn — but Viper has denial range adjacent so that's risky. Let me move to (4,1) to approach. Wait — I have shadow_strike which keeps cloak and does 1dmg. But I'm not cloaked. I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. Moving toward the cluster: go to (4,2) this turn to position for shadow_strike on Viper next turn. Actually with 1HP any hit kills me. I should try shadow_strike on Viper if I can get adjacent. Move to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Viper at (4,3). Then I can shadow_strike. But Viper is a Vector with denial range adjacent — does that block my abilities? It says cloak/breach blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Shadow_strike should still work. Move to (4,2), then shadow_strike Viper at (4,3).
- **Viper** (vector): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,2) and critical — attack to finish them off. Then move west to (3,3) to maintain denial pressure and position away from Weaver. Note (3,3) has a trap but that only triggers on enemy step, not my movement.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(5,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,5) - I'm in denial range blocking their abilities. I have 3HP so I need to be careful. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Ghost is at dist 1, so pulse would hit Ghost for 1 damage. Doc is at dist 2, out of pulse range. I could attack Ghost for 1 damage or pulse for 1 damage to Ghost. Pulse is better if there are multiple targets but only Ghost is adjacent. Attack is same damage. I'll pulse Ghost since it's the same damage and keeps my options open. Then I could move to (5,4) to maintain denial pressure while getting slightly better positioning. Actually, staying at (5,5) keeps Ghost in denial range. Let me pulse Ghost first, then assess - or move to (5,4) first to potentially get Doc in pulse range too. From (5,4), Ghost at (4,5) is dist ~1.4 (diagonal, not adjacent), Doc at (4,4) is dist 1 - that puts Doc adjacent for pulse. But Ghost wouldn't be in pulse range. Better to stay and pulse Ghost now while adjacent.
