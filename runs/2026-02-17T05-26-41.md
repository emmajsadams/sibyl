## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Snare** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(2,4) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1: Use cloak first to become invisible, then move forward toward enemy lines to get in position for future shadow_strike/breach plays
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(3,0) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: cloak immediately as ordered, then advance toward enemies to close distance for future breach/shadow_strike opportunities
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is in range at (2,1). I'll move south to (2,3) to maintain distance and avoid being rushed, then use precision_shot on Bulwark for 2 damage.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is in range at distance 4. I can use precision_shot without moving to deal 2 damage. Staying at (1,0) keeps me at maximum range and away from enemies.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✗ Position occupied → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Marksman is 2 tiles away at (2,3). Move to (2,2) to close distance, then shield_wall facing North toward Marksman and Snare.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Enemies are far away. Move forward to (1,4) to position for trapping key tiles. Then trap (2,2) where Shade is standing - when Shade moves, this becomes a chokepoint enemies must cross to reach our backline.
  State: Bulwark 9/10, Hawk 4/4, Ghost 5/5, Shade 5/5, Marksman 2/4, Snare 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Bulwark is at (2,1) facing N. I can move to (2,0) to get behind him, then use shadow_strike (keeps cloak) for 2 damage. This maintains my cloak for future breach opportunities.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and adjacent. Move behind (2,4) to get breach positioning, then shadow_strike to finish without breaking cloak.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → precision_shot(1,4) ✓
  💭 Snare is at range 4, out of my precision_shot range (3). I need to move closer. Moving to (1,1) puts me at distance 3 from Snare, keeping me at max range while staying non-adjacent to enemies. Then I can precision_shot Snare.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall N ✓
  💭 Advance toward Snare at (1,4). Move to (2,3) to close distance. Then use shield_wall facing North to protect against the enemy vector.
- **Snare** (vector): move(0,4) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,3). Denial passive blocks some abilities. Trap is blocked while adjacent to enemy Vector (none present). Move to (0,4) to create distance, then trap (1,3) to control center approach path.
  State: Bulwark 8/10, Hawk 4/4, Ghost 5/5, Shade 5/5, Snare 5/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,0) ✓ → breach(1,1) ✓
  💭 Hawk is close, behind me, and facing away. Move to (1,0) to get adjacent and behind, then breach to turn them against their team.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → breach(0,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Snare is 2 tiles away and I'm already behind it. Move adjacent to (1,4) then breach to take control of the enemy vector.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move north and attack Bulwark. Bulwark is my ally at (2,3), but orders override. Move to (1,2) or (1,3) to get closer north, then precision_shot at Bulwark (2,3) which is in range.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(0,4) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (1,4), triggering Denial passive to block their cloak. Use pulse to damage Ghost and potentially hit others within 1 tile. Then move to (0,3) to place trap at (1,3) next turn and control center.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) W ✓
  💭 Snare is nearest at dist 2. Move toward Snare at (0,3) by moving to (1,3). Then shield_wall facing West since both enemies (Snare W and Shade far SW) are in that direction.
  State: Bulwark 5/10, Hawk 4/4, Ghost 4/5, Shade 5/5, Snare 5/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → breach(1,2) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Hawk is at (1,2) facing N. I'm at (1,0). Position (1,1) is directly behind Hawk and adjacent. Move to (1,1), then breach Hawk to turn them against their team.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → breach(0,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Snare is blocking abilities and I'm already behind them. Move to (0,4) behind Snare, then breach to turn them against their team.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,3) ✗ Position occupied → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move north and attack Bulwark. Moving from (1,2) to (1,3) puts me on Bulwark's position. Will use precision_shot on Bulwark after moving (1dmg since I moved this turn).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(0,3) ✓ → move(1,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (0,3) and has DENIAL active, blocking my abilities. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Snare first, then move toward Shade at (1,1) to advance.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(0,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost at (0,4) is adjacent, blocking my north. Bulwark wounded at (1,3) east. Hawk at (1,2). I can pulse to hit Ghost+Bulwark (both within 1 tile), then move south to (0,2) to maintain range and avoid being surrounded.
  State: Bulwark 3/10, Hawk 4/4, Ghost 3/5, Shade 5/5, Snare 4/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): breach(1,2) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent and facing away (I'm behind at 1,1). Perfect breach opportunity - I can turn their striker against them. Move to (2,3) behind Bulwark first to set up next turn's breach on the sentinel.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(0,3) ✓ → breach(0,2) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Snare is at (0,2) facing S, I'm at (0,4) facing W. Position (0,3) is directly behind Snare and adjacent. Move there, then breach to turn the vector against their team.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say attack Bulwark, but I'm adjacent to Snare's DENIAL zone - abilities are BLOCKED. Must move away first to use precision_shot. Move to (2,2) to escape denial and get range on Bulwark at (1,3), then precision_shot.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall E ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm at 2/10 HP but fortified. Attack Shade, then shield_wall facing E where most threats are (Shade + Snare direction).
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(0,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded and adjacent at (0,3). Pulse will hit Ghost for 1dmg. Then move to (1,2) to maintain range control and position for traps/denial on enemy advances.
  State: Bulwark 2/10, Hawk 4/4, Ghost 2/5, Shade 4/5, Snare 4/6 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical health at (1,3) and I'm already behind him. Shadow_strike for 2dmg to finish him off while keeping cloak intact.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(0,2) ✓ → breach(1,2) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Snare is 2 tiles away facing E. I can move to (0,2) which is behind Snare and adjacent, then breach to flip them to my side. This removes enemy vector denial and gives us control.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✗ Cannot use precision_shot — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Adjacent to Snare's denial zone - abilities blocked. Orders say attack Bulwark at (1,3). Move to (1,1) for distance from Snare's denial, then precision_shot Bulwark.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Adjacent to 2 enemies (Shade at 2,3 and Snare at 1,2). Snare's DENIAL zone blocks abilities. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Must use basic attack since abilities are blocked. Attack Snare first (vector at 1,2), then can't move due to fortify passive.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(1,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Three adjacent enemies — perfect pulse target. Pulse hits all 3 (Bulwark critical, Hawk healthy, Ghost wounded), then move to safety at (2,2) to maintain mid-range control.
  State: Hawk 3/4, Ghost 1/5, Shade 4/5, Snare 3/6 | Dead: Bulwark, Marksman

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(0,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical HP at (0,2). Move to (0,3) behind Ghost, then shadow_strike to finish them off while staying cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(0,1) ✓
  💭 Snare(vector) at (2,2) is wounded and only 2 tiles away. Must stay non-adjacent to avoid ability blocking. Shade is 3 tiles away at (0,3). Orders say attack Bulwark/sentinel, but no such unit visible - likely referring to finishing wounded enemies. Will use precision_shot on Snare from current position (within range 3, will deal 2dmg since not moving first), then move to maintain distance from threats.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,2) ✓ → trap(0,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk is 3 tiles away at (0,1). I should move closer to engage and cut off their approach to our backline. Moving to (1,2) puts me adjacent to potential enemy paths and within range to trap key tiles. I'll place a trap at (0,2) to block Hawk's northward movement toward Shade.
  State: Hawk 3/4, Shade 4/5, Snare 1/6 | Dead: Bulwark, Ghost, Marksman

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,1) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (0,1) facing W. I can move to (1,1) which is behind and adjacent to Hawk. With breach exhausted, I'll use shadow_strike to deal 2 damage while maintaining stealth positioning.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is critical (low HP) and in range. Use precision_shot to secure the kill. I haven't moved yet, so it will deal full 2 damage. Staying at range (1,1) away from Shade.
  State: Hawk 1/4, Shade 4/5 | Dead: Bulwark, Ghost, Marksman, Snare
