## Squads
### Player
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Doc** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
### Opponent
- **Lattice** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as advised. All enemies are out of range. Lattice at (2,4) is the primary threat with denial range. I'll cloak then advance north toward (2,3) to close distance while invisible.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, time to cloak. Doc is at (4,0) facing N — I'm at (4,4). Moving south toward Doc while cloaked. I'll cloak first, then advance to (4,1) to get behind Doc next turn.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP. I should advance toward the frontline to support. Wraith is at (2,3) which is closest to enemies. I'll move toward Wraith to stay adjacent for overclock support. Moving to (3,2) gets me distance 2 from Wraith. Then overclock Wraith to prep them for engagement.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest enemy is Lattice at distance 6, needs range 2. Move toward enemies to get into range. Best move is toward (2,0) or (1,1) to close distance while staying away from adjacency. Move to (2,0) closes distance toward Lattice at (2,4) by 2, bringing dist to 4 — still out of range. No ability possible this turn.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies approaching from south. Doc at (3,2) dist=3, Bolt at (2,0) dist=4. I should move south to cut off approach paths and place a trap on a likely enemy route. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer while staying out of melee. Then trap (2,1) to catch enemies moving north along the center column — both Doc and Bolt are in that corridor.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Nearest enemy is Doc at (3,2), dist=3. Move toward Doc: from (3,5) move to (3,3) to close distance by 2. Then shield_wall facing S to cover approach direction — but enemies are to my south (Doc at 3,2 is south of me). Most enemies are south. Use shield_wall facing S after moving to (3,3).
  State: Bolt 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Doc 12/12, Bulwark 8/8, Lattice 9/9, Shade 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Lattice (vector) from my current position (2,3) since Lattice faces S. Lattice is adjacent and has DENIAL active blocking abilities. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone first, then I can use breach or shadow_strike. Moving to (3,4) puts me behind Bulwark (sentinel). But my cloak drops after this turn, so I should act now. Since Lattice DENIAL blocks abilities while adjacent, I can't breach Lattice from here. I can move to (3,4) which is behind Bulwark, then breach Bulwark — this uses my cloak turn effectively and sets up control of the sentinel. Orders say use breach on sentinels to break defensive posture.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining. Doc is at (3,2) facing N, and I can reach (3,1) which is directly behind Doc and adjacent. This is a perfect opportunity to breach Doc - the medic is a high-value target. Move to (3,1) then breach Doc to take control of the medic next turn.
- **Doc** (medic): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm surrounded by enemies (Bulwark N, Lattice W, Shade S) and Lattice's denial zone blocks my abilities. Orders say move toward enemy lines. I should attack Shade (adjacent to S) but denial blocks abilities. Best move: attack Shade with basic attack (that works under denial), then move deeper into enemy territory toward (4,3) or (4,4) to pressure their backline.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At (2,0), I have Lattice(vector) at dist=2 and Shade(specter) at dist=2, both in range. No enemies are wounded, so orders say target enemy medic — but no enemy medic is visible. Between the two in-range targets, Shade is a specter (high mobility threat) and Lattice is a vector (denial threat blocking my precision_shot if I move adjacent). I'm currently not adjacent to Lattice, so precision_shot is available. I'll fire precision_shot on Shade at (3,1) for 2 damage since I haven't moved yet. Then I should consider repositioning — but orders say stay at maximum range and never move adjacent. My current position at (2,0) is already at range 2 from both threats. Moving could risk adjacency or lose range. I'll wait after the shot to hold position.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(2,0) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (2,0), distance 2 - in range. There's already a trap at (2,1) between us and Bolt, which will damage Bolt if they move north. I should attack Bolt directly since they're in range, and consider moving to better position. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to Wraith/Doc cluster while maintaining distance from Bolt. Alternatively, I can attack Bolt now and then move north to threaten the enemy backline. Let me attack Bolt first (1dmg), then move to (2,3) to threaten Wraith and Doc who are at dist 3, putting me closer for next turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward enemy back line, exposing myself. Lattice is at (2,3), Shade at (3,1). Moving to (4,4) pushes me away from Lattice and deeper into enemy territory. I can attack Doc at (4,3) who is adjacent, applying pressure on the back line medic. Moving first to (4,4) loses Fortify but follows orders.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Doc 11/12, Bulwark 8/8, Lattice 9/9, Shade 1/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Breach is on cooldown. I need to either eliminate a target or stay safe. Doc at (4,3) is the priority healer target — I can reach (4,2) which is behind Doc and adjacent for shadow_strike. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. But I'm uncloaked (cloak was broken). Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Doc for shadow_strike. That's aggressive but Doc is the highest value target. Alternatively, Bolt at (2,0) is close — I can move to (1,0) which is behind Bolt and use shadow_strike. At 1HP any hit kills me so I need to strike first. Shadow_strike on Bolt from (1,0): Bolt is healthy so 1dmg won't kill. Doc is the healer — killing Doc prevents healing. I'll go for Doc: move to (4,2), shadow_strike Doc at (4,3). This removes the healer threat.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown and I'm not cloaked. Shade is at critical HP and is the priority target — the enemy damage dealer. I can't reach Shade (dist 3) in one move. I could move toward (4,5) to get closer to Shade's flank, but no behind positions are reachable. Bulwark is adjacent but breach is on cooldown and I'm not behind them. Lattice is 2 tiles away — I need to avoid getting adjacent. Best play: move to (2,2) which puts me behind Lattice, then use breach on Lattice (dist=1, behind=true) to control them. This uses my second breach charge effectively. Wait — breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining, so I CAN'T breach this turn. Shadow_strike on Bulwark is an option (adjacent, keeps cloak if I had it, but I'm not cloaked). Attack Bulwark for 1 damage? Or move toward Shade. Let me move to (4,5) to flank Shade next turn, and shadow_strike Bulwark from current position since they're adjacent and I can hit before moving — actually move then ability. Move to (3,5), then shadow_strike Bulwark at (4,4)? Dist from (3,5) to (4,4) = 1+1=2, not adjacent. Better: shadow_strike Bulwark now (adjacent at dist 1), then move toward Shade at (4,5).
- **Doc** (medic): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward enemy lines. I'm at (4,3) with Bulwark(sentinel) adjacent at (4,4) and Shade(specter, critical) adjacent at (4,2). Lattice(vector) is at (2,3), 2 tiles away - must avoid going adjacent to it. All allies have full HP so no healing needed. I should attack Shade who is critical - that could eliminate them. Then move toward enemy lines but away from allies. Wraith is at (4,5) so moving north puts me near Wraith. Moving to (5,4) or (5,3) goes toward enemy lines. Attack Shade first (adjacent, critical - likely kill), then move to (5,4) to pressure enemy side away from Lattice's denial range.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) is at (2,3), dist=3, in range for precision_shot. No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy closest/most threatening. Lattice is the vector (denial unit) and is in range. I must not move adjacent to Lattice. Current position (2,0) keeps me at dist=3. If I stay put, I can fire precision_shot without moving, getting full 2dmg. Best to stay and shoot Lattice.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Bolt is at (2,0) approaching from the south - there's already a trap at (2,1) blocking that path. I should place another trap to cover alternate approach routes. Wraith and Doc are at distance 4 from the northeast. I can move north toward (2,5) to get closer to the backline area and place a trap on a likely enemy approach path. Moving to (2,5) puts me in position to deny the northern area. I'll place a trap at (3,4) or (4,3) to intercept Wraith/Doc who are approaching from the east. Let me move to (3,4) first to get in range, then trap a key chokepoint.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,5) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward enemy back line, exposing myself. Lattice is at (3,4), so I want to move away from them. Wraith is at (4,5) and Doc is at (5,4) — these are the back line units nearby. Moving to (5,5) gets me away from Lattice and into the enemy cluster. I'll attack Wraith or Doc after moving. Moving to (5,5) puts me adjacent to both Wraith at (4,5) and Doc at (5,4). I'll attack Doc since medics are high priority targets.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Doc 9/12, Bulwark 7/8, Lattice 9/9 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Lattice (vector) is the support/denial unit, not primary damage. Bulwark (sentinel) is adjacent at (5,5). I need to identify the damage dealer — Bolt is my ally striker. Looking at enemies: Bulwark is sentinel, Lattice is vector. Neither is a striker/damage dealer, but Lattice is the denial threat blocking my abilities. I can reach (3,3) which is behind Lattice — that's the priority per orders (breach sentinels, assassinate damage dealer). Move to (3,3) to get behind Lattice, then breach Lattice to take control. This avoids Bulwark for now and addresses the vector denial threat. (3,3) is in valid moves list and is behind Lattice.
- **Doc** (medic): attack(5,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (5,5). I can attack it for 1 damage. Orders say move toward enemy lines. Lattice is at (3,4) distance 2 — I must stay at least 2 away or abilities get blocked. I'm currently at (5,4). Valid moves include (4,5) which keeps me near Bulwark without closing on Lattice. Attack Bulwark first, then move to (4,5) to stay in the fight while not getting adjacent to Lattice.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Lattice at dist 5, Bulwark at dist 8). My range is 2. I need to close distance. Valid moves include (4,0) which brings me closer to Lattice at (3,4) - that would be dist 4 from (4,0), still out of range. No move gets me within range 2 of either enemy. Best I can do is move toward Lattice. (4,0) gets me to dist=4 from Lattice still out of range. (3,1) gets me to dist=3 from Lattice. Neither gets me in range. Move to (4,0) to advance toward enemies while staying away from adjacency. After moving, still no targets in range so second action is wait.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive blocks their cloak ability. I should pulse to hit Wraith (dist=1) and potentially Doc if she's within 1 tile of me. Wraith is at dist=1 so pulse will hit them. Doc is at dist=2, outside pulse range. After pulsing Wraith, I'll move to (4,4) to maintain medium range positioning and threaten Doc while staying away from Bolt approaching from (4,0). Actually, I should trap a key chokepoint first - Bolt is coming from (4,0) and will need to pass through central tiles. Trap at (4,2) or (3,2) would intercept Bolt's path. But Wraith is adjacent so trap is BLOCKED by Denial rule (trap blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector). So I'll pulse Wraith first, then move to reposition and potentially trap next turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies toward the enemy back line. Lattice is at (4,4), so I need to move away from that direction. Valid moves are (3,5), (5,3), (5,4). Moving to (5,3) gets me further from Lattice and closer to the enemy cluster around (3,3)-(4,0). Doc is adjacent at (4,5) - I can attack first then move toward the back line. Attack Doc (adjacent, in range) then move to (5,3) to push toward enemies.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Wraith 3/4, Doc 8/12, Bulwark 6/8, Lattice 9/9 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (3,3), not cloaked. Orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer — but both enemies here are Bulwark (sentinel) and Lattice (vector). No striker visible. Orders also say use breach on sentinels. Bulwark is at (5,3) facing S — behind tile is (5,4). Lattice is at (4,4) facing E — I'm already behind it at (3,4). Lattice is a vector which blocks my cloak/breach when adjacent. If I move to (3,4) I'm adjacent to Lattice — that would block breach. So I should breach Lattice first, or target Bulwark. Actually: move to (5,4) puts me behind Bulwark and adjacent — then I can breach Bulwark. But Lattice at (4,4) is nearby and moving to (5,4) keeps me dist=2 from Lattice, so not adjacent — breach should work. Move to (5,4), then breach Bulwark from behind.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → patch(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (4,4), so my abilities are BLOCKED. I cannot use patch or overclock. Wraith is wounded at (5,4) with 3/4 HP, distance 2 from me. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone to be able to heal Wraith next turn. Moving to (5,5) would put me adjacent to Wraith at (5,4) and away from Lattice. But (5,5) is in valid moves. From (5,5), I'd be adjacent to Wraith and could heal. However, since abilities are blocked THIS turn, I should move to (5,5) to get adjacent to Wraith, then my second action would be to use patch on Wraith - but wait, I need to check if moving away from Lattice unblocks abilities. The warning says I'm currently adjacent, so after moving to (5,5) I'd no longer be adjacent to Lattice. That means after moving, I should be able to use patch. Move to (5,5) first, then patch Wraith at (5,4).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close to range 2 without going adjacent. Lattice is a vector - I must avoid being adjacent to it (denial range: adjacent blocks precision_shot). Moving to (5,2) would put me at dist 2 from Bulwark at (5,3) and dist 2 from Lattice at (4,4). Check: dist from (5,2) to (4,4) = |5-4|+|2-4| = 1+2 = 3, not adjacent. Dist from (5,2) to (5,3) = 1, that's adjacent to Bulwark. Try (4,2): dist to Bulwark (5,3) = 1+1 = 2, in range. Dist to Lattice (4,4) = 0+2 = 2, in range. Not adjacent to either. But wait - can I reach (4,2) in mv2 from (4,0)? Yes, (4,0)->(4,1)->(4,2). No enemies are wounded so orders say target enemy medic - but there's no medic. Both healthy, so I'll target Bulwark (sentinel). Fire precision_shot at Bulwark from (4,2).
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(3,undefined) ✗ Out of bounds
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (5,4) - my Denial passive is blocking their cloak. Doc is at (5,5) and Bolt at (4,2). All three enemies are clustered to my east/southeast. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Wraith at dist=1 would be hit. But I should consider moving first to get better position. If I move to (3,4) I create distance and can trap approach paths. Better play: pulse Wraith now (they're adjacent, taking 1dmg), then move to (3,4) to place myself further back and set up trap coverage. Actually, pulse hits ALL within 1 tile of target - targeting myself at (4,4) would hit Wraith at (5,4). Let me pulse to damage Wraith and use Denial, then move back.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (5,4). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Wraith first, then use shield_wall facing North to protect against Bolt at (4,2) and cover the northern threat cluster.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Wraith 2/4, Doc 8/12, Bulwark 5/8, Lattice 9/9 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 6 — player
- **Doc** (medic): patch(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (5,4) with 2/4 HP and needs healing. I'm at (5,5), so Wraith is adjacent to me. I should patch Wraith first. Lattice(vector) is at (4,4) - if I stay at (5,5), I'm not adjacent to Lattice so my abilities won't be blocked. After patching Wraith, I'll wait since I'm already adjacent to the most threatened ally.
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(5,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks cloak/breach. Bulwark is at (5,3) facing S — I'm already behind it at (5,4). I can't use breach on Bulwark while Lattice is adjacent and DENIAL is active. Best move: use basic attack on Bulwark (not blocked by denial) to deal damage, or move away from Lattice first to enable breach. If I move to (3,4) I get behind Lattice and out of denial range — then breach Lattice to neutralize the vector threat. But wait: moving to (3,4) is adjacent to Lattice, so DENIAL still applies. I need to move somewhere not adjacent to Lattice. Valid moves not adjacent to Lattice: (2,4),(3,3),(3,5),(4,3),(4,5),(5,1),(5,2). None of these let me also be adjacent to breach Bulwark or Lattice after moving. Priority: Bulwark is healthy and adjacent, I'm behind it right now. Attack is not blocked by denial — use shadow_strike on Bulwark (keeps cloak... wait, I'm not cloaked). Use regular attack on Bulwark since I'm adjacent and behind. That deals 1 damage. Then move away from Lattice denial to set up breach next turn.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark (sentinel) is wounded and at distance 2 — perfect target for precision_shot (2dmg). I'm not adjacent to Lattice (vector) so precision_shot is not blocked. Stay at current position (4,2) to maintain range 2 from both enemies. Fire precision_shot on Bulwark to attempt a kill.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 At 3/8 HP with fortify active, I need to be cautious. No enemies are adjacent so I can't attack. Moving to (4,3) advances toward Bolt at (4,2) — then they'll be adjacent next turn. I should use shield_wall facing North to protect against Bolt, or face toward the cluster. Lattice is at (4,4) to my NW. Enemies: Bolt at (4,2) is S of Lattice, Wraith at (4,5) and Doc at (5,5) are N. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Bolt and between enemies. shield_wall facing N covers Wraith+Doc direction and protects Lattice.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,5) - pulse will hit them for 1dmg and potentially Doc at (5,5) if within 1 tile. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of me at (4,4): that's Wraith at dist=1. Doc is at dist=2, won't be hit. Bolt is at dist=2, won't be hit. After pulse, I should move to deny Wraith's abilities via adjacency and set up area control. Moving to (5,4) keeps me adjacent to Wraith and in range of Doc, maintaining Denial pressure on Wraith (specter - cloak blocked). Bulwark is at (4,3) wounded - I should stay nearby for support.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Wraith 3/4, Doc 8/12, Bulwark 2/8, Lattice 9/9 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical HP and a prime target. I can move to (5,3) which is behind Bulwark and adjacent — then breach them. This is optimal: breach a nearly-dead sentinel to potentially finish them or set up Bolt for the kill. Lattice is 2 tiles away at (5,4), so moving to (5,3) puts me adjacent to Lattice which would block breach. Check: Lattice is at (5,4), I'd be at (5,3) — that's adjacent to Lattice, so breach would be blocked. Instead, move to (3,4) to stay clear of Lattice's denial range, then shadow_strike Bulwark... but Bulwark is at (4,3), dist from (3,4) is not adjacent. Alternative: move to (4,4) — behind Lattice, adjacent, not adjacent to another vector. From (4,4) I can breach Lattice (the vector, not a damage dealer but denial piece) or shadow_strike. Orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer — Bulwark is sentinel (critical HP), Lattice is vector. Neither is a 'damage dealer' per se but Bulwark is critical. Move to (4,4): adjacent to Lattice at (5,4) — but wait, moving adjacent to Lattice blocks cloak/breach. I'm not cloaked so breach just needs range≤2 and behind. At (4,4) behind Lattice, I can breach Lattice. But Lattice blocks breach when adjacent. So breach on Lattice from (4,4) is blocked. Shadow_strike on Lattice from (4,4) works (adjacent, stays cloak — but I'm not cloaked). Regular attack on Lattice. Actually orders say use breach on sentinels. Move to (5,3) behind Bulwark: adjacent to Lattice? (5,3) to (5,4) = adjacent. Breach blocked. Best play: move to (3,4), then shadow_strike Bulwark at (4,3)? Dist from (3,4) to (4,3) = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, not adjacent. Move to (4,4), attack Lattice (healthy, 1dmg). Or move to (5,3) and attack Bulwark (critical — likely kills). Bulwark at critical means 1HP, attack kills. (5,3) is adjacent to Lattice at (5,4) — blocks cloak/breach but NOT shadow_strike or attack. Move to (5,3), attack Bulwark to finish them.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(5,3) ✗ Cannot use patch — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (5,4), which means my abilities are BLOCKED by denial zone - only basic attack or movement work. Wraith is wounded at (5,3) with 3/4 HP but I can't heal them while Lattice is adjacent. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone to enable abilities. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=2 from Lattice (no longer adjacent), and dist=1 from Wraith at (5,3). Then I can use patch on Wraith.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at dist=1 (adjacent), which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first to use precision_shot. Moving to (3,2) puts me 2 tiles from Bulwark at (4,3) — dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still within range 2 — and away from Lattice. From (3,2), Bulwark at (4,3) is dist ~1.4, in range. Precision_shot does 2dmg but 1dmg if moved. Bulwark is critical so even 1dmg should finish it. Let me move to (3,2) then use precision_shot on Bulwark.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(5,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith and Doc are both adjacent (dist=1). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will damage both Wraith and Doc simultaneously. After pulsing, I should move away to create distance and avoid being surrounded. Moving to (5,5) puts me at corner, limiting approach angles while staying in range to threaten. Denial is already blocking adjacent enemies from using cloak/breach etc.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Wraith 2/4, Doc 7/12, Lattice 9/9 | Dead: Bulwark, Shade

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,5) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 2HP, cloaked. Lattice is at (5,5) facing N — I'm already behind them. (5,4) is directly behind Lattice and adjacent. I can move to (5,4) then use breach to take control of Lattice. This is ideal: I'm behind, breach is ready, and I can use it without breaking cloak. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent and behind for breach.
- **Doc** (medic): patch(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is wounded at (5,4) with 2/4 HP and is adjacent to me at (4,4) — distance 1. I have 1 heal remaining. I need to heal Wraith. However, Lattice(vector) is at (5,5) which is distance 2 from me, so not adjacent — my abilities are NOT blocked. I can use patch on Wraith at (5,4). After healing, I should stay near Wraith. I'll use patch first, then wait or stay put.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (5,5), distance 5, out of my range 2. No enemies in range from current position. Valid moves include (5,2) which gets me closer. From (5,2), distance to (5,5) would be 3 - still out of range 2. Best reachable position to close distance: (5,2) puts me at dist 3, still out of range. (4,3) puts me at dist ~2.8, still out. (4,2) dist to (5,5) = sqrt(1+9)=~3.16. None of my moves get me within range 2. Closest I can get is (5,2) at dist 3 or (4,3) at dist ~2.8. Orders say stay at max range - I should move to maximize position without going adjacent. Move toward (5,2) to close distance for next turn, but cannot shoot. Wait on ability.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(5,5) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (5,4) - my Denial passive blocks their cloak. Doc is wounded at (4,4) in range 2. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - using pulse will hit Wraith at dist=1. Then I can trap a path tile to deny approach. Moving to (4,5) would let me pulse both Wraith and Doc if they're within 1 tile, but from current (5,5), only Wraith is within 1 tile. I'll pulse now to hit Wraith, then trap (5,3) to block Bolt's advance path.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(5,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) directly behind Lattice at (5,5) facing N. Denial zone blocks cloak/breach but NOT basic attack. I'm at 3HP, cloaked status unclear. Lattice is healthy and adjacent. Since denial blocks breach, I should use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked, or basic attack. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and works at adjacent range — but denial zone may block abilities. The warning says only basic attack/movement work in denial zone. So I must use basic attack on Lattice. After attacking, I could move away to reposition.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 uses left). Wraith is wounded at 3/4 HP but I can't heal. I need to stay adjacent to most threatened ally. Wraith is at (4,5) which is adjacent to me (4,4) - I'm already adjacent. Lattice(vector) is at (5,5), dist=2 from me. If I move to (4,5) I'd be adjacent to Lattice and abilities would be blocked. I should use overclock on Wraith (our specter damage dealer who is wounded but still fighting) since I can't heal. Wraith is at (4,5), which is adjacent to my current position (4,4). I can use overclock on Wraith right now. Then I should consider positioning - staying at (4,4) keeps me adjacent to Wraith without getting adjacent to Lattice.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,5) ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) is at (5,5), dist=3, healthy. Orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded - Lattice is the only visible enemy and is healthy. I'm at (5,2), range 2 for precision_shot. Lattice is at dist=3 which is within range (≤2 tiles means I need to check - dist=3 is NOT within range 2). Need to move closer. Moving to (5,4) puts me at dist=1 - adjacent, which blocks precision_shot due to Vector denial. Moving to (4,3) or (5,3): from (5,3) dist to (5,5) = 2, within precision_shot range and not adjacent. From (5,3) I'm not adjacent to Lattice. Let me use (5,3) - dist to Lattice becomes 2, within precision_shot range, not adjacent.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(5,5) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,5) - wounded and right next to me. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Wraith and possibly Doc at (4,4) if they're within 1 tile of my position. From (5,5), units within 1 tile: Wraith at (4,5) is distance 1 - YES. Doc at (4,4) is distance sqrt(2) ~1.41 - depends on AoE calculation, but likely not. Bolt at (5,3) is distance 2 - NO. So pulse hits Wraith for sure. Wraith is wounded, so pulse could finish or heavily damage them. After pulse, I can place a trap on a key approach tile. Moving to (5,4) puts me closer to Bolt which is risky. Moving to (3,5) opens space but moves away from denial range on Wraith. Best: pulse first to hit wounded Wraith (and maybe Doc), then trap a tile Bolt must cross like (5,4) to block their advance.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, overclocked (2 ability uses), adjacent to Lattice at (5,5) facing N. Lattice's denial zone blocks cloak/breach but NOT basic attack. I need to move to (5,4) to get behind Lattice, then use breach (which requires being BEHIND enemy) — but wait, denial blocks breach too. So I must use basic attack. Move to (5,4) first to get behind, then attack Lattice. Actually denial blocks abilities including breach, but basic attack works. With overclocked I get 2 ability uses — but if denial blocks all abilities, I should move to (5,4) and attack twice... wait, overclocked gives 2 ability uses not 2 attacks. Let me re-read: denial means only basic attack/movement work. Move to (5,4) to get behind Lattice, use attack (basic attack works in denial zone) as first action. For second ability use — attack again? The system says 2 ability uses this turn, so I can use attack twice. Move to (5,4), then attack Lattice at (5,5), then attack again.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,2) ✓ → overclock(5,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bolt is wounded at (5,3) dist=2, not adjacent. I can move to (5,4) to get adjacent to Bolt, then use overclock on Bolt to boost damage output. (5,4) is also adjacent to Lattice at (5,5) though — that would block my abilities. Better to move to (4,3) or stay near Bolt without being adjacent to Lattice. Moving to (5,2) gets me adjacent to Bolt at (5,3) without being adjacent to Lattice at (5,5). From (5,2), Bolt is adjacent (dist=1), Lattice is at dist=3. Then overclock Bolt.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(5,5) ✓
  💭 I have OVERCLOCKED status giving me 2 ability uses. Lattice (vector) is at (5,5), distance 2, healthy. I'm at (5,3) which is exactly 2 tiles away — safe from denial range. Orders say to use precision_shot on most wounded; Lattice is the only target and is healthy. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. With 2 ability uses, I can fire precision_shot twice on Lattice for 4 total damage. I must stay at current position to avoid moving adjacent to Lattice.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(5,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 2HP - very low. Bolt is at (5,3) dist=2, wounded. Doc is at (5,2) dist=3, wounded. I can attack Bolt with pulse (hits all within 1 tile - Bolt is dist=2, too far for pulse). I can use attack on Bolt (adjacent only - Bolt is dist=2, not adjacent). Bolt is in range=2 which matches my range. I can use trap or pulse. Pulse range is 1 tile AoE - Bolt is at dist=2, out of pulse range. I should place a trap between them and me to slow their advance, or attack Bolt directly. Wait - my attack is adjacent only, Bolt is dist=2. My ranged attack is range=2 so I can attack Bolt. Let me check: ability 'attack' is range adjacent only. So I need to move closer or use trap. Trap range is ≤2 tiles - I can place on (5,4) to block Bolt's path north. That forces damage if Bolt advances. With 2HP I should stay back and place trap, then consider moving away.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded at 3/5 HP but patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I should stay adjacent to Bolt and use overclock to boost their damage output since I can't heal. Bolt is at (5,3), I'm at (5,2) — already adjacent. Use overclock on Bolt, then wait or move to maintain position.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✗ Out of range → precision_shot(4,5) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Lattice is critical and in range at dist=3. I'm overclocked so I get 2 ability uses. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire twice at Lattice to finish it off.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 At 2HP I need to be cautious. Both enemies are wounded. Bolt is at (5,3) moving north, Doc at (5,2) moving south. I should place a trap on (5,4) which is already marked as a trap tile - wait, that's an existing trap. Valid moves include (5,4) but that has a trap. Bolt is moving north from (5,3), could step to (5,4) where there's already a trap. I should move to threaten with pulse or place another trap. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer but still safe. From (4,4) I can place a trap on (5,4)... but there's already one there. Let me place trap on (4,3) or (5,5) to cut off paths. Actually, moving to (3,5) keeps me back and I can trap (4,4) or (4,3) to block approach. With only 2HP, staying safe is priority. Move to (3,5), then trap (4,4) to deny the path enemies would take approaching from east.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bolt is critically wounded at 2/5 HP and adjacent to me at (5,3). Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). I should use overclock on Bolt to give them 2 abilities next turn - they're my damage dealer and need to act aggressively. Lattice is far away at dist=5, so no immediate threat to my ability use. I'll stay adjacent to Bolt and overclock them.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 1HP - critical. Lattice is at (3,5), distance 4, out of my range 2. I have overclocked (2 ability uses) but no enemies in range. I need to close distance to get Lattice in range without going adjacent. Moving to (4,4) puts me at distance ~2 from (3,5) - let me check: from (4,4) to (3,5) is sqrt(1+1)=1.41, so dist=2 tiles (Chebyshev). That's within range 2. But I'm at 1HP so I must be careful. Moving to (4,4) then using precision_shot on Lattice (critical = low HP, secure the kill). From (4,4) to (3,5): not adjacent (diagonal distance >1), so precision_shot should work. I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg - but Lattice is critical so 1dmg should finish it.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. Doc is at (5,2) dist=5, wounded. I need to control approach paths. Move toward center to get better trap placement, then lay a trap on a likely approach tile. Doc is moving south, so paths through (4,3) or (3,3) are likely. I'll move to (4,4) to reposition and trap (4,3) to catch Doc's approach.
  State: Doc 7/12, Lattice 1/9 | Dead: Bolt, Wraith, Bulwark, Shade

### Turn 13 — player
- **Doc** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No heals remaining, so patch is unavailable. No wounded allies visible. Lattice is at (4,4), dist=3, so I'm safe from denial. Orders say use overclock on damage dealer if all healthy. I should move closer to allies and use overclock. Moving to (5,3) to stay positioned, then wait since no ally coordinates are visible to overclock.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - extremely vulnerable. Doc is at (5,2) dist=3, wounded. There's already a trap at (4,3) which blocks direct approach. I should move away from danger and place another trap to further block Doc's path. Moving to (3,5) puts distance between me and Doc while staying useful. Then place a trap at (4,4) or somewhere on Doc's approach path. Valid moves include (3,5). I'll move to (3,5) to increase distance, then place a trap at (4,4) - my current position - to block Doc's advance route.
  State: Doc 7/12, Lattice 1/9 | Dead: Bolt, Wraith, Bulwark, Shade

### Turn 14 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies listed in range or nearby. Lattice is at dist=5, not a threat this turn. I should move toward Lattice to close distance and support, while looking for allies to overclock. Moving toward (4,4) to close gap with Lattice at (3,5).
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded at (4,4) distance 2 - within trap range and attack range. I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. Doc is wounded so finish them off. I can place a trap at (4,4) or attack directly. Attack does 1dmg to adjacent only - Doc is dist 2 so not adjacent. Trap does 2dmg on step. Place trap at (4,4) to finish Doc if they step on it, or I could move adjacent and attack. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Doc at (4,4) for a direct attack. But at 1HP moving closer is risky. Better to place trap at (4,4) directly - that's 2 damage and Doc is wounded. Let me check: trap requires empty tile at range ≤2. Doc is AT (4,4) so I can't trap occupied tile. Move to (4,5) to get adjacent, then attack for 1dmg. Or place trap somewhere Doc must pass. Actually I should just move adjacent and attack to finish the wounded Doc.
