## Squads
### Player
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
### Opponent
- **Weaver** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Weaver at (1,4) is closest and could deny my cloak/breach if I get adjacent, so I'll move toward (2,4) to close distance while staying out of Weaver's denial range. Insight is at (2,5) directly north — moving to (2,4) puts me one tile from Insight next turn.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(1,0) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist=6 > 4). I need to advance to get scan range on them. Moving south toward enemies while staying behind front line. Allies Longshot at (4,4) and Weaver at (1,4) are ahead of me. I'll move to (2,2) to close distance — that puts me dist=3 from Watcher at (1,0) and dist=3 from Lattice at (3,0), both within scan range. Then I can scan Watcher for intel.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,2) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Insight is in scan range at distance 3. Weaver is at distance 4 but currently at (1,4) - I need to check if moving north would put me adjacent to Weaver. I'm at (1,0), Weaver is at (1,4) - distance 4, not adjacent. I can scan Insight now to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. After scanning, I should reposition to maintain distance. Moving to (0,2) would keep me away from enemies while staying in range for future scans.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Watcher is at dist 6, Lattice at dist 5. I need to close distance to get into range 2. Moving toward center to get closer to Lattice (3,0) while maintaining positioning. Move to (4,2) gets me to dist 3 from Lattice - still not in range. Move to (3,3) gets me closer to both. Best option is to advance toward (4,2) to close on Lattice, then wait for next turn to engage.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are at dist 3-6. I should advance to control the center and lay a trap on a key approach path. Moving to (3,2) puts me in a good central position with denial range threatening the mid-board. I'll lay a trap at (4,3) to block Longshot's likely advance path.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at distance 3-4. I should move toward center to cover approach paths and place a trap on a likely enemy advance route. Watcher at (0,2) will likely push north or toward our backline. Moving to (1,2) gets me closer and lets me trap (0,2) or (1,1) area. Better: move to (2,3) to cover center, then trap (1,2) which is between Watcher and our backline.
  State: Wraith 4/4, Watcher 5/6, Lattice 9/9, Longshot 5/5, Weaver 9/9, Insight 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and adjacent to Weaver (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities. I need to move away from Weaver first to enable breach. I'm already behind Weaver at (2,4) — they face S so I'm north of them, meaning I'm actually in front. Wait, behind check says I AM behind Weaver from (2,4). But DENIAL blocks abilities when adjacent. I should move to (4,3) which is behind Longshot and use breach on Longshot — but that's a trap tile. Instead, move to (3,3) to break from denial zone, then shadow_strike or breach Weaver won't work since I'd no longer be adjacent. Better: move to (3,4) to escape denial, then I still have cloak this turn. Actually cloak expires after this turn. My best move: step to (3,3) to exit denial zone, then breach Weaver from adjacent position — but I'd need to be adjacent and behind. From (3,3) Weaver is at (2,3), dist=1, and Weaver faces S so behind tile is (2,4) — I'd be to the east, not behind. Let me just shadow_strike Weaver now while adjacent — shadow_strike keeps cloak! But denial blocks abilities. So I must move first. Move to (3,4), then shadow_strike Weaver at (2,3) from dist=2? No, shadow_strike is adjacent only. Move to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Weaver at (2,3) and outside denial... wait, denial is based on adjacency to Vector. At (3,3) I'm adjacent to Weaver at (2,3), so still in denial. I need to get 2+ tiles away from Weaver. Move to (3,4) — Weaver at (2,3), dist= sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still adjacent diagonally? Dist=2 tiles Manhattan. That should escape denial. Then I can't shadow_strike from dist=2. Move to (4,4) — dist from Weaver=3, safe from denial. Cloak expires this turn anyway. Best play: move to (4,3) behind Longshot (trap there though — risky), or (4,4) and wait for next positioning. Actually (4,3) is a trap — avoid. Move to (3,4) to get distance, then wait since no ability in range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is already scanned. Weaver at (2,3) is a priority target — scanning it reveals its prompt and deals 1 dmg. Weaver is 3 tiles away (in scan range) and not adjacent to me, so scan is not blocked. I should scan Weaver this turn. No need to move first — I can scan from current position. After scanning, I'll wait or stay put since moving adjacent to Weaver would block future scans.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone which blocks abilities except basic attack and movement. I need to move away from Lattice first to escape the denial zone, then I can use scan on Wraith (the specter) to reveal their prompt and track them after cloak. Moving to (2,4) puts me at distance 2 from Wraith and away from Lattice's denial zone. From there I can scan Wraith at dist=2 which is within range 4.
- **Longshot** (striker): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (3,2) which has DENIAL active, blocking my precision_shot. I need to move away to use precision_shot. Moving to (5,2) puts me 2 tiles from Lattice (dist=2, outside denial zone) and keeps good positioning. From (5,2) I can use precision_shot on Lattice at dist=2 for 2dmg (haven't moved yet — wait, I'd be moving first so it would be 1dmg). Actually, move first then shoot = 1dmg due to movement penalty. Or I could basic attack Lattice now for 1dmg without moving, but that's wasteful. Best plan: move to (5,3) or (5,2) to escape denial, then precision_shot Lattice at range 2 for 1dmg (moved penalty). Alternatively, attack Lattice now (adjacent, 1dmg) then move away. Attack first (no movement yet = full damage? No, attack is just 1dmg regardless), then move to safety. Let me attack Lattice first for 1dmg then move to (5,2) to reposition.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (2,3) dist=2 and Longshot is at (5,2) dist=2. I need to stay out of Weaver's adjacent denial range. Moving to (4,2) keeps me away from Weaver while maintaining range on Longshot. From (4,2) I can trap (4,3) which already has a trap — better to trap a new chokepoint. The trap at (4,3) is already placed. I should trap somewhere enemies will pass through. Insight is at (2,4) moving toward our backline. Trapping (3,3) blocks the path between Weaver/Insight and our backline. I'm currently at (3,2). If I move to (4,2) first, then trap (3,3) — that's within range 2. This places denial pressure on Longshot while blocking enemy advance paths.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (3,4), distance 2 and in range. I can trap the path between us to deter advance. Placing a trap at (3,3) covers the direct approach route Wraith would take moving south toward our backline. Then I can hold position — no need to move since I'm at good medium range and Lattice is 3 tiles away so no denial threat yet.
  State: Wraith 3/4, Watcher 5/6, Lattice 8/9, Longshot 5/5, Weaver 8/9, Insight 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(2,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Insight is adjacent at (2,4) — prime shadow_strike target. I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't maintain cloak, but it deals damage and keeps pressure. After striking, I should reposition away from Weaver's denial range. Move to (4,4) or (4,5) after striking to stay mobile and avoid the traps at (3,3) and (4,3).
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✗ Cannot use scan — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Weaver is at (2,3) distance 3 — already scanned. Insight is at (2,4) distance 4 — exactly at scan range but distance check shows outRange. I need to get closer to Insight. Moving to (1,3) would put me distance 3 from Insight at (2,4), well within scan range. From (1,3) I can scan Insight. Weaver has denial on adjacent only so as long as I don't move adjacent to Weaver at (2,3), I'm safe. (1,3) is distance 2 from Weaver — not adjacent, so scan won't be blocked. Let's move to (1,3) then scan Insight at (2,4).
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Watcher will scan (2,3) — targeting Weaver. I should recalibrate Weaver to warn them or interfere. But more useful: Lattice is at dist=4, just in scan range from current pos. Lattice prompt unknown — scan it for intel before it lays more traps. Also Foresight shows Lattice moving to (4,2) then trapping (3,3) — trap is already there per Traps list, so Lattice may be placing another. I'm at (2,4). I can scan Lattice at dist=4 — but wait, scan requires ≤4 tiles AND scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Lattice is a vector at (4,2), dist=4, not adjacent to me so not blocking. But the range check shows Lattice outRange=true from current position — distance is 4 which should be within ≤4. Let me reconsider: dist=4 means exactly 4, which is ≤4, so scan should work. However the recon says outRange for Lattice. I'll trust the recon data. Instead: both Wraith and Watcher are in range (dist=2). Wraith is already scanned. Watcher is already scanned too. I should recalibrate Weaver (adjacent at (2,3)) to warn about Watcher scanning them and the trap at (3,3). Weaver is at (2,3) which is adjacent. Recalibrate Weaver with intel about the threats, then move to safety away from the (3,3) trap zone.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, so precision_shot is blocked. I can only use basic attack or move. Lattice is right next to me at (4,2). I should move away first to escape denial zone, then attack or use precision_shot. Moving to (5,4) puts me 3 tiles from Lattice and gives me range on Wraith at (4,4) which is dist 2 from (5,4) — within precision_shot range. Let me move to (5,3) first to escape denial, then use precision_shot on Lattice or Wraith. From (5,3): Lattice at (4,2) = dist 2, Wraith at (4,4) = dist 2. Both in range! Wraith is higher priority target. Move to (5,3) then precision_shot Wraith.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(2,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (1,3) - perfect pulse target. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Watcher for 1 damage. After pulse, move to (3,4) to stay at medium range, away from the trap at (3,3), and maintain denial pressure while positioning to cover the backline approach. Avoid (3,3) trap. Lattice is at distance 3 so no denial concern.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(5,1) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (5,3) distance 2, in attack range. There's already a trap at (4,3) between us. I should attack Longshot directly for 1 damage. I could also move to (5,2) to get adjacent and use pulse, but that risks taking melee hits. Better to stay at (4,2) and attack Longshot at range, then consider placing a trap to further block approaches. Actually, trap at (3,3) already exists. I can place a trap at (5,1) or (4,1) to control southern approaches. Let me attack Longshot first (in range at dist 2), then place a trap on a key approach tile like (5,1) to cut off flanking.
  State: Wraith 2/4, Watcher 4/6, Lattice 8/9, Longshot 5/5, Weaver 8/9, Insight 4/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 2HP adjacent to Weaver who has DENIAL active — my abilities are blocked here. I need to escape the denial zone first. Moving to (3,3) puts me behind Weaver (their south) and removes me from denial. From (3,3) I can then breach Weaver — they're facing N so (3,3) is behind them, and it's adjacent. Breach Weaver to take them out of the fight or use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying hidden. But I'm not cloaked, so shadow_strike won't apply cloak bonus. Best play: move to (3,3) to get behind Weaver and exit denial zone, then breach Weaver (0 uses spent, cooldown ready). This neutralizes the denial threat and potentially turns Weaver against their own team.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical and needs help. I already know Insight's prompt. Longshot is at dist=4 but outRange for scan. Priority: recalibrate Wraith to buff them since they're critical. Wraith is at (3,3) — that's 2 tiles away, not adjacent. I need to move adjacent to Wraith first. Valid moves include (2,3) which would put me 1 tile from Wraith at (3,3) — adjacent. Then recalibrate Wraith. But wait — (3,3) has a trap! Recalibrate is range:adjacent only. From (2,3) I'd be adjacent to Wraith at (3,3). Also need to watch Weaver at (3,4) — if I move to (2,3) I'm dist=2 from Weaver, not adjacent, so scan not blocked. Move to (2,3) then recalibrate Wraith at (3,3) — but trap is there, recalibrate doesn't require moving onto the tile. This is valid. Good addendum: warn Wraith about the trap at (3,3) and advise repositioning.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is in scan range at (2,3), dist=3. I've already scanned Watcher so no need to rescan. Wraith is at dist=4 which is out of scan range. My priority should be recalibrating allies or positioning. Longshot is healthy, Weaver is healthy. I'm at 4/6 HP — wounded. Watcher will likely try to scan me or move. Wraith is critical and was heading toward (4,4) last turn. I should move closer to support allies while staying safe. Moving to (2,4) puts me closer to action but risks Watcher scan. Moving to (1,3) keeps me back but closer to the trap at (1,2). Best play: move to (2,4) to close distance, then recalibrate Weaver at (3,4) — adjacent after move. Weaver could benefit from tactical guidance against the enemy vector/specter threats.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical and at dist=2 - perfect for precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn so full 2dmg applies. Lattice is at (4,2) which is 2 tiles away (not adjacent), so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire on Wraith to finish it off, then wait.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at dist=2 and in range. I have traps at (4,3) and (3,3) already placed. Weaver is at dist=3 — must avoid moving adjacent or my abilities get blocked. I can attack Longshot from current position. But better: move to (5,2) to stay at range, then attack Longshot at (5,3) from adjacent. Or stay and use pulse to hit Longshot (dist=2, pulse only hits within 1 tile — too far). Attack has range adjacent only, dist=2 so not adjacent. I need to close to adjacent for attack. Move to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (5,3) — but that's dist=1, which enables attack. However moving to (5,2) keeps me away from Weaver (who is at 3,4, dist would be ~2-3). Let me check: from (5,2) to (3,4) = |5-3|+|2-4|=2+2=4, safe. Place trap at (5,1) — already trapped. Place trap somewhere useful. From (5,2) I could trap (4,2) or (5,3) area. Actually trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy Vector — Weaver is at dist 3+ so fine. Move to (5,2), then trap at (4,3) — already trapped. Trap at (5,3) where Longshot is? Can't trap occupied tile. Trap at (4,4) to block Weaver approach path. Move to (5,2), trap (4,4).
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (2,3), dist 2 — in range for trap or attack. Orders say trap paths to backline and avoid center (3,3). I should move east to pressure and stay away from Lattice. Move to (4,4) to stay at medium range from Watcher while pushing east. Then place a trap at (3,3) to block the center path enemies must use — wait, orders say avoid (3,3). Place trap at (4,3) instead to block eastern approach. Watcher will scan me this turn but I'm already revealed. Pulse isn't useful yet — Watcher is alone at dist 2.
  State: Watcher 4/6, Lattice 8/9, Longshot 5/5, Weaver 8/9, Insight 4/6 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (2,3) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Watcher is an oracle not a vector, so scan should work. However, Watcher is already scanned. I could attack (1dmg) or recalibrate an ally. I'm at 4/6 HP and Watcher is adjacent which is dangerous. I should move away to safety first, then recalibrate an ally. Moving to (3,4) keeps me in range of allies. Weaver is at (4,4) adjacent to (3,4) so I could recalibrate Weaver. Or I could attack Watcher first then move. Attack does 1dmg from adjacent, then move away to (3,5) or (1,5) to create distance. Let me attack Watcher then retreat to (1,4) to stay safe.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(5,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 At 3/6 HP I need to be careful. Insight is at dist=2 and already scanned. Longshot is at dist=3 and unscanned — scan them to reveal their prompt. I should avoid moving adjacent to Weaver (currently at 4,4). Traps at (3,3) and (4,3) — avoid those tiles. I can scan Longshot from current position (dist=3, within range 4). After scanning, move away from Insight who is at (1,4) — moving to (2,2) keeps distance from enemies and avoids traps.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone, so precision_shot is blocked. I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Valid moves: (5,4) moves me north away from Lattice (dist becomes 2), clearing the denial zone. From (5,4) I can then use precision_shot on Lattice at (5,2) — dist=2, within range, no movement penalty since I moved before shooting... wait, precision_shot does 1dmg if moved. Still, Lattice is healthy so 1dmg is better than nothing. Alternatively, move to (4,2) to get dist=2 from Lattice and potentially get LoS on Watcher at (2,2) dist=~2.8 still out of range. Best plan: move to (5,4) to escape denial, then attack Lattice with basic attack... no, that requires adjacent. From (5,4) Lattice is at (5,2) dist=2, so use precision_shot for 1dmg (moved penalty). That's the best available action.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(5,3) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Longshot is at (5,4), dist=2, in range for attack. Trap at (5,3) would block Longshot's approach path toward me and my backline. I'm at (5,2), Longshot is at (5,4) — placing trap at (5,3) cuts off that column approach. (5,3) is a valid move tile so I can reach it, but I need to check if I can trap from current position: trap range ≤2, (5,3) is dist=1 from me, valid. Place trap at (5,3) first to deny that corridor, then attack Longshot for 1 damage since it's in range at dist=2.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher will scan me this turn. No enemies in range for pulse. Lattice is at (5,2) — dist 3, so I must not move adjacent. Orders say push east to pressure. Move to (5,3) puts me adjacent to Lattice at (5,2) — bad, that would deny my abilities. Move to (4,5) keeps distance. Actually (5,3) is adjacent to Lattice(5,2) — avoid. Best move: (4,5) to stay safe and away from center trap at (3,3). Then place a trap to block enemy approach paths. Trap at (4,3) already exists. Place trap at (3,4) to block western approach toward our backline.
  State: Watcher 3/6, Lattice 7/9, Longshot 4/5, Weaver 8/9, Insight 4/6 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → scan(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/6 HP and Longshot will prioritize me as a wounded enemy. Insight is within scan range (dist:3) but I already have their prompt. Priority: move away from danger and recalibrate Lattice who is healthy but could use tactical guidance. Wait - recalibrate requires adjacent range only, and Lattice is at (5,2) which is too far. I can scan Insight again for 1 damage since they're in range, but I already know their prompt. Better to reposition - move north away from potential Longshot threats, and scan Insight for chip damage since they're the only enemy in range. Moving to (2,4) gets me further from Longshot's precision_shot targeting wounded enemies. From (2,4), Insight at (1,4) is still adjacent (dist:1) - that would block scan due to Vector adjacency rule... no, that's only Vector adjacency that blocks scan. Insight is an oracle not a vector. So I can scan Insight from (2,4) at dist:1 for 1 damage. This weakens their scanner. Let me move to (2,4) then scan Insight at (1,4).
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (2,4) - wounded enemy oracle. I'm at 3/6 HP so I need to be careful. Scan is blocked when adjacent to Vector, but Weaver is at (4,5) - not adjacent to me, so scan should work. I can scan Watcher to deal 1 damage (already know their prompt but damage is useful). However, scan requires target within 4 tiles and Watcher is at dist=1, so scan works. Actually, attack also works at adjacent range. Watcher is wounded - finishing them off or further damaging them is priority. Attack deals 1 damage and they're wounded. Scan also deals 1 damage AND reveals prompt (already known). Either ability works at dist=1. I should move away first to get distance from Watcher (they're adjacent = dangerous for me), then scan from safe distance. Move to (0,4) or (0,5) to increase distance, then scan Watcher at dist=2-3. Wait - if I move to (0,4), dist to Watcher becomes 2, still in scan range. That's safer. Let me move to (0,5) first, then scan Watcher from there - dist would be sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, in range. Or move to (2,5) - dist to Watcher = sqrt(0+1)=1... no. Move to (0,4): dist to Watcher at (2,4) = 2. Valid. Then scan Watcher for 1 damage.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is wounded at dist=3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 is out of range for precision_shot which requires ≤2 tiles). Lattice is at dist=2, healthy. I need to prioritize killing Watcher but dist=3 is outside precision_shot range. Lattice is adjacent-ish at dist=2 — I must not move adjacent to Lattice or precision_shot gets blocked. Current position (5,4): Watcher at (2,4) is dist=3, out of precision_shot range. I could move to close on Watcher but valid moves near Watcher: (4,4) would be dist=2 from Watcher at (2,4) — that's valid. But (4,4) is also dist=... Lattice is at (5,2), moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=2 from Lattice — safe (not adjacent). From (4,4), Watcher at (2,4) is dist=2 — in range for precision_shot! Also (4,3) is a trap. Move to (4,4), then precision_shot Watcher.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → pulse(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5). Watcher is at (2,4) dist=3, critical but out of range. Lattice is at (5,2) dist=4. No enemies in range. Orders say to trap enemy paths and pressure east. Trap at (3,4) already exists. I should move toward Watcher to get in range, but (3,4) has a trap so avoid it. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to Watcher at dist=2 which puts them in pulse range. Then I can trap a path tile. From (3,5), Watcher at (2,4) would be dist=2, in pulse range (1 tile AoE - no, pulse hits within 1 tile). Watcher is critical, I need to get adjacent or within 1 tile. Move to (3,5) puts Watcher at dist=2, still out of pulse range. Move to (2,5) would put Watcher at dist=1, in pulse range! Valid moves include [2,5]. From (2,5) Watcher at (2,4) is dist=1 - pulse hits all within 1 tile. That would finish Watcher (critical). But orders warn about Watcher scanning me. Let me move to (2,5) and pulse Watcher.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with traps already at (4,3), (3,3), (5,1), (5,3). Longshot is at (4,4) heading west - they'll likely move toward my position. I need to place traps to intercept approach paths. (4,1) would be a good trap location to cover southern approach. I can move to (4,2) to get closer and place a trap, but (4,3) already has a trap. Let me place a trap at (5,4) to cover the northern flank where Longshot might approach, or move to cut off paths. Actually, I should trap (4,1) to cover the lower corridor. Move to (4,2) first to be in range, then trap (4,1)... but wait, valid moves include (4,3) which already has a trap. Let me move to (4,2) and place trap at a useful uncovered tile. From (4,2) I can trap tiles within 2 range. Target (3,4) or (4,5) to intercept Longshot's westward movement. I'll move to (4,2) then trap (3,4) to block Longshot's path.
  State: Lattice 7/9, Longshot 4/5, Weaver 8/9, Insight 3/6 | Dead: Wraith, Watcher

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → recalibrate(2,5) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at dist=6, out of scan range. No enemies in range for attack. I'm at 3/6 HP so I should stay safe. Weaver is adjacent at (2,5) — I can recalibrate them to boost effectiveness. Move closer to get Lattice in scan range next turn, but avoid traps at (1,2),(4,3),(3,4). Moving to (2,4) puts me closer while staying safe. Then recalibrate Weaver at (2,5) to give tactical intel.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice(vector) is at (4,2), distance 2 — exactly in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Lattice is healthy but 2dmg is significant. I'm not adjacent to Lattice so no denial block. Fire precision_shot first, then hold position (no need to move, staying out of adjacent range).
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (4,2) heading west, wounded. I need to control the approach paths. Trap at (3,4) is already placed (enemy or mine). Valid moves include (3,5) which keeps me at medium range and lets me place a trap on the western approach path. Moving to (3,5) then placing trap at (3,3) would be ideal but warning says avoid (3,3). Instead, place trap at (2,3) to cover the central approach corridor — enemies heading west-northwest would hit it. My position (2,5) is fine but moving to (3,5) pushes east per orders and extends my trap coverage range.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (4,4), distance 2 — within attack range. I'm at (4,2). Traps already at (4,3) and (3,3) blocking direct approach paths. Longshot is directly north at (4,4), so attack is viable. I should attack Longshot for 1 damage, then consider repositioning. Moving to (3,2) would keep me at medium range and open trap placement options for Weaver's approach path. Actually, I can attack Longshot now (dist 2, range 2) and then move west to (3,2) to avoid being adjacent to Weaver if they close in.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Lattice is wounded and in scan range at dist=3. Scanning will reveal their prompt AND deal 1 damage, potentially finishing them off or giving team intel. I'm at 3HP so I need to stay safe. After scanning, I should move away from Lattice to avoid being adjacent. Moving to (2,5) keeps distance and gets me behind the front line.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice is wounded at (3,2), dist=3, which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). Wait — dist=3 means out of range for precision_shot (range≤2). I need to close to range 2. Moving to (4,2) would put me at dist=2 from (3,2) (|4-3|+|2-2|=1, actually dist=1 — adjacent! That would block precision_shot). Moving to (5,3) gives dist=|5-3|+|3-2|=3, still out of range. Moving to (4,3) has a trap. Moving to (5,4) gives dist=|5-3|+|4-2|=4. I need to be exactly 2 tiles away without being adjacent. Tile (4,2) is dist=1 from (3,2) — adjacent, blocks precision_shot. Tile (5,2) not in valid moves. Tile (3,3) has a trap. Tile (2,4) gives dist=|2-3|+|4-2|=3. Hmm. Actually wait — current dist is 3 and inRange shows Lattice is 'inRange:true'. Let me re-check: from (4,4) to (3,2): |4-3|+|4-2|=1+2=3. precision_shot range ≤2 tiles means dist≤2. But the recon says inRange:true... I'll trust the recon data. So I can fire from current position. No movement needed — just use precision_shot on wounded Lattice.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 4HP, moving W. Enemies are all at dist 3-4, none in range. Traps already at (4,3),(3,3),(5,1),(5,3). I need to control the approach paths. Weaver is at (3,5) heading toward my position — the path down column 3 is already trapped at (3,3). Longshot at (4,4) might push through (4,3) which is also trapped. I should move to (2,2) to stay at medium range and away from Weaver's denial zone, then place a trap at (2,3) or (2,4) to catch enemies funneling around the existing traps.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (2,2), wounded and distant. No enemies in range. Traps at (3,3) and (3,4) — must avoid both. Valid moves exclude (3,3) but (3,4) is listed as valid — it has a trap so I should avoid it too. I'll move to (4,5) to maintain distance from center traps and pressure east. From (4,5) I can place a trap on a likely approach path — (4,3) already has a trap, so I'll target (3,5) area or place at (5,4) to cover eastern approach. Actually, trap at (5,4) would block enemy advances along the east flank.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice is wounded at (2,2), distance 3 — within scan range and not adjacent, so scan is viable. I've already scanned Lattice so prompt is known. Better to recalibrate an ally with useful intel. Longshot failed precision_shot last turn due to range — recalibrate Longshot at (4,4) but they're not adjacent to me at (2,5). Distance to Longshot is 2 tiles, recalibrate requires adjacent. I can move closer to Longshot first. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,4)? Distance from (3,5) to (4,4) = sqrt(1+1) = ~1.4, that's diagonal, likely adjacent. Then recalibrate Longshot to help with targeting. Lattice is wounded — a scan would deal 1 more damage but prompt already known. I should move toward Longshot to recalibrate, helping them target effectively. Traps at (3,4) and (3,3) — avoid those. Move to (3,5) is safe (not in trap list), and (3,5) is adjacent to Longshot at (4,4) diagonally. Recalibrate: tell Longshot that Lattice is wounded at (2,2), avoid traps at (3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(5,4), and to position for a clean shot.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 Lattice is wounded at (2,2) but dist=4, out of my range-2 precision_shot. Valid moves include (4,2) which gets me to dist=sqrt(4+0)=2 from (2,2)? No: dist from (4,2) to (2,2) = sqrt(4+0)=2. That's exactly range 2! But (3,3) and (3,4) are trapped. (4,2) is safe and closes to exactly range 2. Move to (4,2), then precision_shot Lattice at (2,2). Must check: not adjacent to Lattice (dist=2, not adjacent), and I haven't moved before shooting... wait, I move first then shoot — precision_shot deals 1dmg if moved. Lattice is wounded so even 1dmg may finish it. Let's do it.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 3/9 HP, low health. Longshot is at (4,2) distance 2, in range. I have traps at (2,3) and (3,3) already blocking northern approach. I need to avoid taking more damage. My trap ability is blocked if I'm adjacent to an enemy - Longshot is at dist 2 so I can trap. I should place a trap on (3,2) to block Longshot's approach path, then move west to (0,2) to create distance and stay alive. Actually (3,2) is in valid moves list so I can move there, but better to trap it from current position. Let me trap (3,2) to block Longshot, then move to (1,2) to increase distance.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Lattice is far at dist 7, no enemies in range. Traps at (3,4), (4,3), (5,4) block several move options. Valid moves: (2,5), (5,5) are safe. (5,4) is trapped. I should place a trap to deny approach paths. Moving to (5,5) pushes east as ordered and keeps me safe from center traps. From (5,5) I can trap (5,4) — wait, that's already trapped. I could trap along the enemy approach corridor. From current position (4,5), I can trap within range 2: any empty tile ≤2 away. Enemy approach from west means corridors through y=4,5 rows. Trap at (2,5) would block western approach along top row. Move to (5,5) first, then trap at (3,5) to cover the approach lane toward Insight.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → recalibrate(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/6 HP and need to stay safe. Lattice is at distance 6, out of scan range (max 4). Weaver tried to place a trap at my position last turn - I should move to give Weaver room to place traps. There are traps at (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,4) - many squares around me are trapped. I can move to (4,4) which is valid and not trapped, then recalibrate Weaver at (5,5) - but (5,5) is adjacent to (4,5) not (4,4). Let me reconsider. From (4,5) I could reach Weaver at (5,5) adjacently. Move to (4,5) then recalibrate Weaver to advise them not to trap my position. Actually (5,4) is trapped. Move to (2,5) to stay safe and away from trapped zones, keeping range options open. From (2,5) I can't reach Weaver adjacently. Best play: move to (4,5) - valid, not trapped - then recalibrate Weaver at (5,5) since they're adjacent, telling them to avoid trapping ally positions.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(0,2) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (0,2), distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close to range 2 or less. Moving to (2,2) gets me adjacent (bad - denial). Moving to (3,2) puts me at distance 3, still out of range. Best valid move toward Lattice without getting adjacent: (3,1) or (3,2). Wait - valid moves include (2,2) but that's adjacent to Lattice at (0,2)? No, Lattice is at (0,2), (2,2) is distance 2 from Lattice - that's fine for precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles). But (2,2) is also listed as a valid move tile. From (2,2), distance to Lattice at (0,2) is 2, within range! And not adjacent. No traps at (2,2). Move to (2,2) then precision_shot Lattice to finish it off.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(0,4) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,2) with only 2HP - critically low. Longshot is at (2,2), distance 2, within my range. I need to be careful. I can't use trap while adjacent to an enemy, but Longshot is at distance 2 so I'm not adjacent. I should lay a trap on a key path tile to block Longshot's advance, then move away to safety. Trap at (1,2) would block the direct path, or I could trap (2,3) but that's already trapped. Let me trap (1,3) to block approach from the north, then move to (0,4) to create distance while staying in a defensive position. Actually, Longshot is at (2,2) heading west - likely to move toward me. I should move first to get distance, then trap a chokepoint. Move to (0,4) to gain distance, then trap (1,3) to block the corridor.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 8/9 HP. Lattice is far away at (0,4), dist=6, out of range. No enemies in range currently. There's a trap at (5,4) so I need to avoid that. Valid moves: (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (5,4) — but (5,4) has a trap, avoid it. I should place a trap to control enemy approach paths. Moving to (4,4) gives me a better central position to threaten with pulse later, but I need to avoid the trap at (4,3). From (4,4) I can trap nearby corridors. Actually, I can trap from current position first, then move. Let me trap (4,4) to deny that approach path — wait, I should move first to a safer spot, or trap first. I'll trap at (4,4) to block that approach corridor (enemies coming from west must pass through center), then move to (3,5) to reposition. Actually trapping (4,4) then I can't move there. Let me trap a useful tile that's not my move destination. Trap at (5,3) would be useful — south approach. Then move to (4,4) to maintain pressure. But (4,3) has a trap already. Trap (3,5) to block northern approach, then move to (4,4).

### Turn 11 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(3,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP (critical), Lattice is at distance 5 and out of scan range. No enemies in range. Weaver is adjacent at (3,5) and could use recalibrate to improve tactics. The trap field is dense around (3-5, 3-4) area. I should recalibrate Weaver to coordinate against Lattice, then move to (5,5) to stay safe and maintain range. Weaver is adjacent to me at (3,5) - wait, Weaver is at (3,5) and I'm at (4,5), so Weaver IS adjacent. I'll recalibrate Weaver first to push aggressive tactics against Lattice, then move to (5,5) to safety.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(0,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (0,4), distance 4, currently out of range. I need to close to range 2. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer - dist from (1,3) to (0,4) is sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, adjacent, which triggers denial. Moving to (2,4) puts me at dist=sqrt(4+0)=2 from (0,4) - exactly range 2, avoids adjacency. Check traps: (2,4) is not listed as a trap. From (2,4) I can precision_shot Lattice at (0,4) - dist=2, within range. Lattice is critical so this should finish it.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(0,5) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/9 HP — critical condition. Longshot is adjacent at dist=2 and can likely finish me. I need to escape. Move to (0,5) to put more distance, then use pulse on Longshot if still in range (dist would be 3 from (0,5), out of pulse range). Actually pulse range is 1 tile AoE — only hits units within 1 tile. Longshot at (2,4) is dist=2 from me now, dist=3 from (0,5). Better to move away and place a trap on a path tile to slow pursuit. Move to (0,5), then trap (1,4) which is a key corridor tile enemies would cross.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(1,5) ✓
  💭 Lattice is critical at (0,5) and 3 tiles away — out of range for pulse or attack. I need to move closer to get in range, but must avoid getting adjacent (denial). Valid moves include (2,5) which gets me to dist=1 from Lattice — too close, denial risk. Move to (1,5) is dist=2 from (0,5), still adjacent risk. Best: move to (2,5) puts me at dist=2 from (0,5) — not adjacent, so denial doesn't apply. From (2,5) I can use pulse targeting myself to hit Lattice at (0,5)? No, pulse is 1-tile AoE from my position, and (0,5) is 2 tiles away. Can't reach with pulse. Attack is adjacent only. I can't kill Lattice this turn from any valid move without getting adjacent. Better to place a trap on Lattice's likely path. Lattice is at (0,5) heading north — nowhere to go on top row. It may move south or east. Trap at (1,5) could catch it moving east. Move to (2,5) first, then trap (1,5) to block Lattice's eastward escape. (1,5) is not in my trap list and is empty — valid trap placement from (2,5) which is within range 2.
