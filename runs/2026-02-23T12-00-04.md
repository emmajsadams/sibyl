## Squads
### Player
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(3,0) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Moving to (3,3) gets me 3 tiles closer to Warden while staying central.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(2,5) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders. Then move toward Hawk at (2,1), closing distance to 1 so I can shadow_strike next turn while cloaked. Best move is toward (2,2) to close distance to 3, setting up approach.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist 6 and 8, need ≤4). I need to advance toward them to get scan range. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer but still won't reach. Best move is (4,2) to close distance - from there Hawk at (2,1) would be dist 3, within scan range next turn. No allies need recalibrate (both healthy). Will move closer then wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is in range at distance 3 from current position. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers. Oracle is high-value. I can use precision_shot on Lens without moving (range ≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 which exceeds range 2). Need to move closer. Moving to (3,2) puts me at dist=2 from Lens at (4,2), within precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet so no penalty. Warden is out of range at dist 4.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (3,2), distance 2 — closing fast. I'm at (3,4). Moving to (3,3) puts me directly between Hawk and my allies Shade(2,2) and Lens(4,2). From (3,3) Hawk will be adjacent next turn. I didn't move far so Fortify won't apply, but I can use shield_wall facing South to protect allies behind me from Hawk's likely advance.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,0) facing N. Allies Phantom@(3,3) and Hawk@(3,2) are ahead. Enemies Warden@(3,4) and Lens@(4,2) are out of range. My orders are to hold the front line between allies and enemies. Moving to (2,1) gets me closer to the action and between my allies and the enemy cluster. No enemies in range to attack yet, so I'll advance and wait.
  State: Bastion 10/10, Phantom 5/5, Hawk 5/5, Warden 10/10, Shade 5/5, Lens 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → breach(4,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — must use it wisely this turn. Lens (oracle) is higher priority than Warden (sentinel). I can move to (4,3) which is directly behind Lens at dist=1, then use breach to take control of the dangerous oracle. This burns my cloak approach well. Warden is facing S so I'm already in front of it — not ideal for breach. Lens is the bigger threat and I'm already behind it from (4,3).
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Orders: move away from allies and toward edge, then stay still next turn. Currently at (4,2). Allies are at (3,4) and (2,2). Edge tiles available: (5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4) are on the east edge, away from allies. Move to (5,4) gets me to edge and away. But Phantom is at (4,3) adjacent — scan it first would reveal info but orders say move. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not Phantom. I can scan Phantom (dist=1, in range). But orders say move away and stay still next turn. I'll scan Phantom for intel (deals 1 dmg too), then move to edge tile (5,4) to get away from allies.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. I need to use it wisely. Hawk is a high-value striker adjacent to me. I can move to (3,1) to get behind Hawk, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This keeps me invisible and eliminates the striker threat. Bastion is a sentinel (low priority vs striker). Move to behind Hawk at (3,1), then shadow_strike Hawk at (3,2).
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Shade (specter) is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot. Priority: move away from Shade to enable precision_shot, then target Warden (sentinel, high-value). Moving to (4,2) increases distance from Shade to 2 and keeps Warden at range 2. From (4,2), Shade is at dist=2 and no longer adjacent, so precision_shot is unblocked. Warden is the priority target per orders (sentinels are support). I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (3,1) — attack immediately for free damage while fortified. Stay in place to maintain 50% damage reduction since I didn't move last turn and should hold the line.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with Fortify active. Phantom is at (4,3) dist=2, closest threat. I should move toward Phantom to close distance and get adjacent for attack. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Phantom at (4,3) - I can then attack. This also positions me between Lens at (5,4) and the enemy cluster. Moving loses Fortify but enables attack.
  State: Bastion 10/10, Phantom 3/5, Hawk 4/5, Warden 10/10, Shade 4/5, Lens 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge, stay still next turn. I'm at (5,4), allies at (4,4) and (3,1). Moving to (5,5) gets me to the corner edge, away from Warden at (4,4). That's a valid move tile. Then wait as ordered.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Warden is adjacent at (4,4). I'm at 3HP and uncloaked. Shade is at (3,1) facing S — I can reach behind position (3,2) in one move. Engaging Warden with shadow_strike now keeps me stealthy and deals damage, but Warden is a tanky sentinel and I need to set up better positioning. Better play: shadow_strike Warden (free damage, no cloak break), then move to (3,4) to threaten Shade next turn from behind. Actually, shadow_strike requires adjacent — Warden is adjacent. Strike Warden first, then reposition behind Warden at (3,4) to set up breach when cooldown ends next turn.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,0) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (2,1) facing N, but I'm not behind it. I can move to (2,0) to get behind Bastion, then use breach to take control of this healthy sentinel. That's high value — a breached sentinel with shield_wall could block for my team. Alternatively, shadow_strike Bastion now for 1 damage while staying cloaked... but I'm not cloaked. Phantom is wounded at (3,4) and reachable via (3,3) behind. Hawk is healthy at (4,2) and I'm already behind it from (3,2). Best play: move to (2,0) to get behind Bastion and breach it — a healthy sentinel under my control is massive value. Breach is ready, I'm not adjacent to a Vector, so no blocking.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is in range at dist=2. Orders say precision_shot high-value targets — Warden is a sentinel, not highest priority, but it's the only target in range. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot does full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to any Vector so precision_shot isn't blocked. After shooting, I'll reposition to maintain distance — Warden is at (4,4), I'm at (4,2). Moving to (3,2) or (5,2) keeps distance. Stay at current position and shoot first, then move to (5,2) to keep range while watching for Shade approaching from (2,0).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Warden at (4,4) and use shield_wall. Shade is adjacent at (2,0) but orders prioritize moving toward Warden. Best move toward (4,4) is (4,1) — max distance covered. From there I can't reach Warden with shield_wall (dist still 4). No adjacent allies to shield_wall either. I'll move toward Warden and wait since no valid shield_wall targets.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded — attack to finish them off. I'm fortified so staying put preserves damage reduction. Attack first, then shield_wall west to block any incoming threats from that direction.
  State: Bastion 10/10, Phantom 2/5, Hawk 4/5, Warden 8/10, Shade 4/5, Lens 5/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → scan(5,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge, then stay still next turn. I'm at (5,5) which is already near the top-right corner. Valid moves include (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4). Moving toward edge means staying on x=5 or y=5. (5,3) moves me south along the right edge, away from Warden at (4,4) and Shade at (2,0). Hawk is at (5,2) and used precision_shot on (4,4) last turn — staying on x=5 column might put me in line but orders are orders. I'll scan Hawk since it's in range (dist=3) to reveal its prompt and deal 1 damage before moving, or move first. Actually orders say move away from allies — Warden is at (4,4), so I should move away from (4,4). (5,3) is closer to Warden than (4,5). (4,5) keeps distance from Warden better. But 'toward edge' — (4,5) is still on y=5 top edge. I'll move to (4,5) to stay on the top edge while slightly away. Actually, Hawk at (5,2) used precision_shot on (4,4) last turn — scanning Hawk is valuable intel. Scan costs my ability slot. Orders say move + stay still. I'll move to (4,5) and scan Hawk for intel.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining). Bastion is the closest enemy at dist 3. I can reach (3,1) which is directly behind Bastion — adjacent and behind. Move to (3,1), then shadow_strike Bastion for 1 damage while staying stealthy.
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) which is already behind Warden at (4,4) facing E. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Warden is healthy and adjacent. I can shadow_strike Warden (keeps cloak if I have it, but I'm not cloaked). Actually, I should use breach on Warden since I'm behind them - that takes them out of the fight for a turn and costs no HP. Breach cooldown is ready. Then I can move toward Lens for next round. Warden is the immediate threat since it's adjacent and healthy. Using breach: I'm at (3,4), Warden at (4,4) facing E, and I'm behind them. After breach, move to (5,5) to get behind Lens for a shadow_strike next turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is a specter (high mobility, damage dealer) at dist 3 - priority target. I'm at 3/5 HP so maintaining distance is wise. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Shade at (3,1) is in range from current position (5,2). Fire precision_shot on Shade, then wait to maintain position.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,2) W ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Warden at (4,4) and use shield_wall to protect teammates. Shade is adjacent at (3,1) - a threat to my wounded allies. I can move to (4,3) to get closer to Warden, but I won't be adjacent to any ally to use shield_wall effectively. Hawk is at (5,2) - if I move to (4,2) I'd be adjacent to Hawk and could shield_wall. But orders prioritize moving toward Warden. Moving to (4,3) puts me closer to Warden and adjacent to Hawk at (5,2) - I can shield_wall Hawk from Shade's direction (W or S). Actually Hawk is at (5,2), from (4,3) that's adjacent diagonally - no, adjacency is cardinal only. From (4,3): north=(4,4)=Warden enemy, south=(4,2), east=(5,3), west=(3,3). Hawk at (5,2) is not adjacent. From (4,2): north=(4,3), south=(4,1), east=(5,2)=Hawk, west=(3,2). Adjacent to Hawk! I can shield_wall east to protect Hawk. But orders say move toward Warden. (4,3) is one step closer to Warden. I'll move to (4,3) to follow orders, losing fortify but getting closer. No adjacent ally from (4,3) for shield_wall. Better to move (4,2) to be adjacent to Hawk and shield_wall protecting Hawk, then next turn close on Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. My allies are Shade at (3,1) and Lens at (4,5). Enemies are to the south and east. The map edge furthest from combat and allies would be the west or south edge. Valid moves include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,4). Moving to (2,4) gets me furthest west, away from the eastern enemies and away from Lens at (4,5). Then I can wait.
  State: Bastion 9/10, Phantom 2/5, Hawk 3/5, Warden 8/10, Shade 4/5, Lens 5/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(4,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (4,5) and I'm already behind them (I'm at 5,5 which is their behind tile). I have 2HP so I need to deal damage fast. Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack deals 1dmg and Lens is healthy. I'll shadow_strike Lens first (adjacent, behind them) for 1dmg. Then I need to consider my second action - I can't breach (used up), so I'll shadow_strike again if possible or wait. Actually shadow_strike is one ability per turn. I'll use shadow_strike on Lens, then wait since I have no second ability. Or I could move to a safer position after. At 2HP I'm vulnerable - after attacking Lens I should move to safety. Move to (4,4) or (5,4) to get distance.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 4HP (wounded). Phantom just used breach to move to (5,5) and is now adjacent distance 1 — very dangerous as it could shadow_strike me. Hawk at (5,2) is wounded. Bastion at (4,2) is healthy and unscanned. Priority: scan Bastion (healthy, unknown prompt, dist=3 — good value target). I should also reposition away from Phantom who is at (5,5) and dangerous uncloaked. Moving to (3,5) keeps distance from Phantom and Hawk while keeping Bastion in scan range (dist would be sqrt(1+9)=~3.2... wait, from (3,5) to (4,2): dx=1, dy=3, dist=4, still in range). From (3,5) Bastion dist = |4-3|+|2-5| = 1+3 = 4, still in scan range. Move first to (3,5) to gain distance from Phantom at (5,5), then scan Bastion at (4,2).
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → breach(4,2) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (4,2) facing N, and (4,1) is both behind them and adjacent — perfect breach position. I can move to (4,1) and breach Bastion. This wastes their turn and sets up Hawk for elimination. Breach cooldown is ready and I have 1 use left.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,1) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at dist=2 and in range. I'm at 3/5 HP, not adjacent to Shade (dist=2), so precision_shot is valid. Orders say prioritize high-value targets — Shade is a specter (damage dealer), so it's a valid target. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Bastion is nearby at (4,2) providing some cover. I'll fire precision_shot on Shade first, then consider repositioning. Moving to (5,3) puts me further from Shade while keeping range.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. I'm at (2,4). Allies are at (4,1) and (3,5). Enemies are to the east. Moving west toward the edge is the right call. Valid moves include (0,4) which is the western edge. I'll move there in two steps: first to (1,4), then to (0,4).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from Hawk (at 5,3) and toward own baseline. Shade is adjacent at (4,1) — I should attack first to deal damage while fortified, then move toward baseline (lower y). Moving to (4,0) puts me at baseline and away from Hawk. Losing fortify is acceptable since I'm moving to baseline.
  State: Bastion 8/10, Phantom 2/5, Hawk 3/5, Warden 8/10, Shade 1/5, Lens 4/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (3,5) facing W, and (4,5) is behind them and reachable. I'm at (5,4) with 2HP — I need to strike Lens who is healthy but isolated. Move to (4,5) to get behind Lens, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked (if I were cloaked — I'm not). Actually I'm not cloaked, so shadow_strike still works adjacent. Move to (4,5) puts me adjacent and behind Lens. Then shadow_strike Lens at (3,5).
- **Shade** (specter): attack(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 1HP — critical situation. Bastion is adjacent at (4,0) and I'm already behind them (facing S). Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). Shadow_strike deals 1 damage while I'm cloaked, but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack also deals 1 damage but breaks cloak (not relevant). Bastion is healthy so I can't kill them in one hit either way. However, I should still attack Bastion since they're adjacent and I have no other options — dealing damage is better than waiting. I'll use attack on Bastion, then wait since I have no other viable targets in range and moving away risks exposure.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → recalibrate(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 3/6 HP. Phantom is adjacent at (4,5) — that's dangerous, especially since Phantom used shadow_strike last turn. I need to escape and scan Hawk who's wounded and not yet... wait, Hawk IS already scanned. All enemies are already scanned. My priority is to avoid Phantom (adjacent, dangerous specter) and support allies. Shade is critical at (4,1). I can recalibrate Shade but Shade is not adjacent — too far. I should move away from Phantom to avoid shadow_strike, then scan... but all enemies are scanned. I could recalibrate Warden or Shade if adjacent. Neither is adjacent. Best play: move away from Phantom to safety, then wait or recalibrate if possible. Moving to (2,5) puts me 3 tiles from Phantom. Or (2,4). Shade is at (4,1) — not adjacent after any move. Warden is at (0,4) — I could move toward Warden to recalibrate. From (3,5) moving to (1,4) gets me adjacent to Warden at (0,4)? Distance would be 1 — yes, adjacent! Then recalibrate Warden to buff them. That's a solid play: move to (1,4), recalibrate Warden at (0,4).
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 Shade is critical and in range at distance 3. I'm at 3/5 HP so maintaining distance is wise. I can use precision_shot on Shade from current position (dist=3, within range 2? No, range is ≤2 tiles). Shade is at dist=3, out of precision_shot range. I need to close to dist≤2. Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Shade at (4,1) — that's dist=1, but being adjacent to enemy Vector blocks precision_shot. Wait, Shade is a specter not a Vector. The warning is about Vector class specifically. So I can use precision_shot at dist=1 against Shade. Move to (4,2) to get dist=1 from Shade, then precision_shot for 2dmg to finish the critical Shade.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from Hawk and toward own baseline. I'm already at y=0 (baseline). Hawk is at (4,2). Moving to (2,0) puts maximum distance from Hawk while staying on baseline. This exposes me to allied fire as ordered.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. I'm at (0,4) facing W, already near the west edge. Valid moves include (0,2), (0,3), (0,5) along the edge, or (2,4) toward center. To move away from ally Lens at (1,4) and toward the edge/away from combat, I should move to (0,2) or (0,5). (0,5) moves north along the edge, away from Lens. Then wait as second action.

### Turn 7 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 2HP, no breach available. Lens is wounded at (1,4) facing W — I can reach (2,4) which is behind Lens and adjacent. Move to (2,4) then shadow_strike Lens for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Warden is healthy and far, not a priority.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → recalibrate(0,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with only 2HP — critically low. Phantom is adjacent at (2,4) and wounded. Foresight shows Phantom will move to (4,5) then shadow_strike (3,5), so it's moving away from me this turn. I need to survive. Scan is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Phantom is a specter not a Vector, so scan should work. However, scanning adjacent targets deals 1 dmg and reveals prompt — Phantom is already scanned. I should move away from Phantom to safety first, then recalibrate Warden at (0,5) who is adjacent. Move to (0,4) puts me adjacent to Warden at (0,5) and safe. Then recalibrate Warden to boost effectiveness. This keeps me alive and supports ally.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Lens at dist 6, Warden at dist 7). Orders say maintain distance. Moving toward enemies to get Lens in range - need to close to 2 tiles. From (4,2), moving to (3,3) gets me closer to (0,4) Lens (dist ~4.2, still out of range). Best move is toward enemies. Move to (3,3) to close distance while staying mobile. Still won't be in range this turn, so I'll move twice - wait on ability.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from Hawk and toward own baseline. I'm at (2,0), Hawk is at (3,3). Moving toward (4,0) increases distance from Hawk and stays at baseline. No enemies in range so no ability use.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → shield_wall(0,4) E ✓
  💭 Phantom is moving to (4,5) and is a key threat. I should move to (2,5) to get closer and position between Phantom and allies. From (2,5) I can use shield_wall toward the East to protect Lens at (0,4) from Phantom's shadow_strike.
  State: Bastion 7/10, Phantom 2/5, Hawk 3/5, Warden 8/10, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, wounded and need to be careful. Warden is adjacent at (2,5) and healthy - dangerous to stay here. Lens is wounded at (0,4) and I'm already behind them per the data. I can move to (1,4) which is behind Lens and adjacent, then shadow_strike Lens for 1 damage while staying cloaked. This eliminates a wounded enemy safely. Shadow_strike keeps cloak so I remain hidden after.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → recalibrate(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Phantom is adjacent at (1,4) and will shadow_strike me. I need to flee. Foresight shows Phantom moving to (2,4) then striking (1,4) — so Phantom ends at (1,4) after their turn. I go first (tied speed, but I'm listed after Phantom who acts first this round per order). Wait — order shows Phantom acts first, then me. So Phantom will move to (2,4) and shadow_strike my current position (1,4)... but I'm at (0,4). The strike targets (1,4) which is where I am? No — I'm at (0,4). Phantom shadow_strikes (1,4) which is adjacent to me. I need to move away from Phantom. Best escape: move to (3,4) to get distance from Phantom, then scan Hawk who is at dist 4 from (3,4) — dist from (3,4) to (3,3) is 1, well in range. Actually Hawk is already scanned. All enemies already scanned. I should recalibrate Warden who is at (2,5) — adjacent if I move to (2,4) or (1,5). Move to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Warden at (2,5). But Phantom moves to (2,4) per foresight — collision? Phantom acts before me, so Phantom would be at (2,4) when I try to move there. Move to (1,5) instead — Warden is at (2,5), adjacent. Then recalibrate Warden. This gets me away from Phantom and buffs our sentinel.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → precision_shot(1,5) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is critical and high-value target but out of range at dist=4. Warden (sentinel) is in range at dist=3. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers — oracle is critical so worth prioritizing. I can move toward Lens to bring it into range (dist=4, need dist≤2 for precision_shot). Moving to (2,4) puts me at dist=3 from Lens still. Moving to (1,5) would be adjacent to Warden which blocks precision_shot. Best play: shoot Warden with precision_shot now (in range, healthy sentinel but present target), then consider positioning. Actually, Lens at critical HP is the priority kill — if I can get adjacent to finish it... but orders say maintain distance. Move to (3,5) reduces dist to Lens to 2 (from (3,5): Lens at (1,5) = dist 2), keeping distance from Warden. Then precision_shot Lens for the kill.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is at (2,5), dist 7 - out of range. Allies Phantom and Hawk are both wounded at (1,4) and (3,5). I need to advance toward the enemy to position between allies and Warden. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while staying in a supportive position. I'm currently fortified but moving will break that - worth it to close distance and protect wounded allies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent at (3,5) and wounded — attack to finish. Stay put to keep Fortify active for damage reduction. Phantom is at (1,4) dist=2, not adjacent so can't attack it this turn.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) facing W with 2HP. Warden is at (2,5) facing E — I'm already behind them (behind check confirms). Position (1,5) is adjacent to Warden and behind them. I can move to (1,5) then shadow_strike Warden — shadow_strike keeps cloak if I'm cloaked, deals 1 damage, and works from adjacent. This is a clean offensive play. Breach is unavailable anyway.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,5) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel not a Vector, so I should check: the warning says precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Warden is a sentinel, so precision_shot should work. However, I moved last turn (→N indicator), so precision_shot does 1dmg. Better to move away first to create distance, then use precision_shot for full 2dmg. Move to (4,5) to get distance=2 from Warden, then precision_shot for 2dmg since I won't have moved this turn relative to the shot.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (1,5) and wounded — attack to finish them. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Phantom first, then wait to maintain fortified status.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,2) with 7HP. Allies Phantom is critical at (1,5) and Hawk is wounded at (4,5). Enemy Warden is at (2,5), dist=5. I need to close distance to protect allies. Moving toward (4,4) gets me closer to both allies and the enemy threat zone. Stay fortified isn't ideal since I need to advance. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (4,5) and closer to Warden. I can shield_wall toward W to cover Hawk from Warden's direction.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, adjacent to wounded Warden who is facing E and I'm already behind them. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage — but I'm not cloaked. Still, I can use shadow_strike for 1 damage since Warden is adjacent. That would finish or heavily wound them. With only 1HP I need to strike and hope allies finish the job.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at distance 2 — exactly in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. That should finish or critically wound them. Stay put to maintain range and LoS.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → shield_wall(2,5) W ✓
  💭 Phantom is critical at (1,5), Hawk is wounded at (4,5), Warden is at (2,5) dist=3. I need to move closer to intercept Warden and shield my allies. Moving to (3,5) puts me between Warden and allies, then I can shield_wall West toward Warden to protect Phantom.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(1,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 4HP, fortified, facing Bastion (healthy) at (3,5) and Phantom (critical) at (1,5). Phantom is critical — attacking it could finish it off. I should attack Phantom first to eliminate the threat, then attack Bastion or shield_wall. If I don't move, fortify stays active (50% dmg reduction). Staying put and using both actions on attacks maximizes damage while keeping fortify.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at distance 2 — perfect range for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved yet so full damage applies. I'm at 2HP so staying put is risky, but Warden is also wounded. Fire first to potentially finish them, then move to (5,5) to maintain distance.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) E ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 3HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Bastion is adjacent at (3,5) wounded. I should attack Bastion while fortified to deal damage, then use shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Hawk and any threats from that direction. Staying in place preserves fortify bonus.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,5). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack the wounded Warden to finish them off, then shield_wall west to block any follow-up threats.
