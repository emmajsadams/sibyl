## Squads
### Player
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
### Opponent
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Remedy** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 - cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Ghost enemy is at (0,0) facing N - I'm at (0,5). I'll cloak first, then move to (0,2) to close distance while staying invisible.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — activate cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Moving to (0,3) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying on the flank away from enemies.
- **Remedy** (medic): overclock(2,5) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Both enemies are far away. Bastion is my frontliner at (2,5) adjacent to me. I should move forward carefully while staying behind Bastion. Ghost is at (0,2) and not adjacent. I can overclock Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn, which would be powerful for a sentinel. Move toward a position adjacent to Bastion first, then overclock them.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Remedy at dist 5, Bastion at dist 7). Need to advance to get Remedy in range (need dist ≤ 2). Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while staying off the front line. Still won't be in range after move, so wait as second action.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✗ Position occupied → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Round 1, overclocked so I get 2 ability uses. Enemies are 5 tiles away, no one in range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move south toward enemy cluster at (2,4) to close distance. Then use shield_wall facing S toward Rampart at (2,0) to protect allies Remedy and Ghost as we advance. Second ability use: shield_wall again or save — use shield_wall facing S to block incoming fire from Rampart's direction.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Push forward aggressively per orders. Enemies are to the north - Remedy at (2,3) and Bastion at (2,5). I can move up 2 tiles to (2,2), closing distance. Then shield_wall facing N to block incoming damage from the enemy cluster directly ahead.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 8/8, Ghost 4/4, Remedy 16/16

### Turn 2 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Rampart is adjacent at (2,2) - I'm a medic with low damage output and my patch ability is blocked when adjacent to enemies. I should move away from Rampart to avoid being blocked, then use overclock on Ghost (specter) who can benefit from 2 abilities next turn. Moving to (1,3) puts me 1 step away from Rampart and keeps me near allies. From there I can overclock Ghost at (0,2) if adjacent, but dist=2 so not adjacent. Better to move to (1,3) to get closer to Ghost, then try to overclock.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(1,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Remedy is adjacent and I can get behind them by moving to (2,3) - the tile behind Remedy (facing W, so east side is behind). From (2,3) I can use breach on Remedy to control them next turn. This is an excellent opportunity - Remedy is a medic and controlling them prevents healing. Move to (2,3) then breach Remedy.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. Rampart is behind-reachable at (2,1) — that's my best target. Move to (2,1) to get behind Rampart, then breach them. This uses breach on a sentinel which is valuable to remove their shield/block capability. Ghost is facing E so I can't get behind them this turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost(specter) at (2,1) is dist=3, just out of precision_shot range (≤2). I need to close distance. Moving to (3,1) puts me at dist=2 from Ghost, enabling precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Ghost is healthy at 4HP so 2dmg won't kill but it's optimal pressure.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge. Allies are at (2,3) and (3,1). Moving to (4,2) takes me toward the east edge and away from both allies. Then I can attack the enemy Ghost at (2,1) — wait, after moving to (4,2) Ghost at (2,1) would be dist=3, out of melee range. Better to attack Ghost first while adjacent, then move to (4,2) to reach the edge.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Enemy Ghost is at (2,3), 2 tiles south. Orders say push forward aggressively. I can move to (2,4) to close distance, then shield_wall facing S toward the enemy Ghost. This advances position and sets up defense facing the threat cluster.
  State: Ghost 4/4, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 8/8, Ghost 2/4, Remedy 16/16

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(1,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with 2HP, uncloaked. Longshot is adjacent at (3,1) and in range. Breach is on cooldown. I can shadow_strike Longshot for 1 damage without breaking cloak — but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack would deal 1 damage. Better: move to (3,2) which is behind Longshot AND behind Rampart, then shadow_strike Longshot from behind. Wait — shadow_strike requires being adjacent and I'd be at (3,2) which is adjacent to Longshot at (3,1). Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. I should just attack Longshot since he's right there at dist=1. Or move to (3,2) first to get behind him, then shadow_strike (still deals 1dmg). Either way it's 1 damage. I'll shadow_strike from current position since Longshot is already in range at dist=1, dealing damage without risk. Actually shadow_strike needs cloak active — I'm not cloaked so I should use regular attack. Longshot is at dist=1, use attack for 1 damage, then move away to safety.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Remedy (facing W, I'm at 2,3 which is their behind tile). Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining), so I can't use it. Shadow_strike works from adjacent and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked. I can use shadow_strike on Remedy (adjacent, dist=1) to deal 1 damage without breaking cloak. Actually I'm not cloaked at all, so shadow_strike vs regular attack — shadow_strike keeps cloak (irrelevant now) but still does 1 dmg adjacent. Remedy is a medic and a healer, priority target. I'm already in position behind them. Use shadow_strike on Remedy for 1 dmg. Then I could move or wait. Bastion is also adjacent at (2,4) but sentinel is tankier. Taking out/pressuring Remedy is higher value. After shadow_strike on Remedy, I can move to (2,5) to get behind Bastion for next turn's breach (once cooldown clears).
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the front line. I'm at (1,3). Allies are at (2,4) and (1,0). Enemies are at (2,5), (3,1), (4,2). The front line seems to be toward the center-right. I should move toward the enemies while staying useful. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to the front line and toward enemies. No abilities are useful right now - Ghost needs a heal but is at dist=3, not adjacent. I'll move toward the front line.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,0) ✓ → precision_shot(1,0) ✓
  💭 Remedy is healthy at dist=2, Ghost is wounded at dist=3. Priority is killing wounded Ghost with precision_shot. I haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg - Ghost has wounded status so 2dmg should finish it. Ghost is at (1,0), dist=3 which is within range=2? Wait, range is ≤2 tiles but dist=3, so Ghost is OUT of range from current position. Remedy at (3,3) dist=2 is in range. I should shoot Remedy with precision_shot for 2dmg, or move toward Ghost first. If I move to (2,0), Ghost at (1,0) would be dist=1 - in range, and I could precision_shot for 2dmg to kill wounded Ghost. Moving to (2,0) then precision_shot Ghost is the best play - kills wounded enemy.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → shield_wall(2,5) N ✓
  💭 Enemy Ghost is adjacent at (2,5) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack the adjacent Ghost first, then shield_wall facing North to protect against further attacks while keeping fortify-like positioning.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge. Allies are at (2,5) and (2,0) — both to the west. Moving east toward the edge (x=5) satisfies both conditions. I can move 2 tiles. Moving to (5,2) gets me to the east edge. I'll lose fortify by moving but orders are clear.
  State: Ghost 3/4, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 3/4, Bastion 8/8, Ghost 1/4, Remedy 15/16

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): breach(2,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) directly behind Bastion at (2,4) who faces S. I have breach ready and I'm in the behind position. Breaching Bastion would make them obey me next turn — very valuable on a healthy sentinel. Then I can shadow_strike to deal damage while maintaining cloak. Priority: breach Bastion first (dangerous adjacent enemy, behind position available), then shadow_strike for damage.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Longshot is adjacent at (2,0). I need to move to (2,1) to get behind Longshot (facing S), then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Shadow_strike keeps cloak, so I survive the turn. This is the best play: reposition behind, then strike without breaking cloak.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward front line. I'm at (3,3). Allies are at (2,4) and (2,1) - they're to the west. Enemies are at (2,5), (5,2), and (2,0). Front line seems to be toward the enemies. Rampart is at (5,2) to the east/southeast. Moving east toward (5,3) or (4,3) pushes toward Rampart. I'll move to (5,3) to advance toward the enemy front line while moving away from allies.
- **Longshot** (striker): attack(2,1) ✓ → move(1,0) ✓
  💭 Enemy Ghost is adjacent at (2,1) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent. I'm at 2HP so need to be careful. Ghost is critical, so one hit kills it. I can move first to (1,0) to break adjacency and gain distance of 2, then use precision_shot on Ghost at (2,1) for 2 damage (no move penalty if ability is second action after move... wait, I moved so it's 1dmg). Actually: move to (3,1) puts Ghost at dist=2, then precision_shot for 1dmg (moved). Or: use attack first (adjacent, 1dmg) to finish critical Ghost, then move away from Bastion threat. Attack at range:adjacent only — Ghost at (2,1) is adjacent. Use attack first to kill Ghost, then move away.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward own backline. I'm at (2,4), ally Remedy is at (5,3). My backline would be away from enemies — enemies are north at (2,5) and far away. Moving south/east gets me away from Ghost and toward my team. I'll move to (4,4) which is away from Ghost and closer to Remedy. No ability needed if just repositioning.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map. I'm at (5,2) facing E. Allies are at (2,5) and (1,0), so moving south toward (5,0) gets me furthest from them and to the map edge. Valid moves include (5,1) and (5,0). I'll move to (5,0) — that's the corner edge, maximum distance from allies. No ability needed given the orders.
  State: Ghost 3/4, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 2/4, Bastion 7/8, Remedy 15/16 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 5 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the front line. Rampart is at (5,0) to the south, distance 3. I'm at (5,3). Moving south toward Rampart while staying away from Bastion at (4,4). Move to (5,1) gets me closer to Rampart. No healing needed this turn since patch is blocked if adjacent to enemies and Bastion is not adjacent anyway.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked and need to use shadow_strike. Bastion is at (4,4) facing E. The behind tile is (3,4) which is adjacent and reachable. I can move to (3,4) which puts me behind Bastion and adjacent, then use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Remedy at dist 5, Bastion at dist 7). I need to advance toward Remedy who is closer. Moving to (3,0) gets me closest to Remedy at dist=2 from (3,0) to (5,1) - wait, that's still dist 3. Let me check: (3,0) to (5,1) = |5-3|+|1-0| = 3. Still out of range. Best move is toward Remedy. At (3,0) I'm at dist 3 from Remedy. Not enough to shoot this turn but better positioning for next round.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(5,1) ✓ → shield_wall(5,1) N ✓
  💭 Remedy is right next to me at (5,1) — adjacent, in range. Attack the medic to deny healing. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Stay put to keep fortify active, attack Remedy first, then shield_wall facing North to protect against the enemy cluster up the board.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward own team's backline. I'm at (4,4) facing E. Ally Remedy is at (5,1) — so moving toward (5,4) or (5,5) keeps me near the east side but away from Remedy who is south. Ghost is adjacent at (3,4) — I should attack before moving to punish them, then reposition to (5,5) to head toward backline while staying fortified bonus may drop since I move.
  State: Ghost 2/4, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 2/4, Bastion 6/8, Remedy 14/16 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 At 2/4 HP, I need to be aggressive. Bastion is at (5,5) facing N, and (5,4) is directly behind them and adjacent. I can reach (5,4) in one move (dist=2 from current pos). From there I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Move to (5,4) first, then shadow_strike Bastion.
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(5,0) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at 5/8 HP and needs healing, but is 4 tiles away - out of reach this turn. Rampart is adjacent at (5,0) threatening me. I need to move toward Bastion while staying safe. Moving to (5,3) gets me closer to Bastion (dist=2) without being adjacent to Rampart. From (5,3) I still can't reach Bastion at (5,5) with patch (adjacent only). Let me move to (5,3) to close distance, and attack Rampart first since it's currently adjacent.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Remedy at dist 5, Bastion at dist 7). I need to close distance to get Remedy in range (need dist ≤2). Moving to (4,1) gets me closer while staying off the bottom edge. From (4,1) Remedy is still at dist ~3, still out of range. Best I can do is move to (4,1) to advance toward Remedy. Still won't be in range this turn, so I'll wait after moving.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,0) with fortify active, but orders say push forward aggressively. Enemies are Remedy at (5,3) dist=3 and Bastion at (5,5) dist=5. Moving to (5,2) closes distance to Remedy to dist=1 (adjacent), letting me attack. Ghost at (5,4) is wounded and needs pressure taken off. Pushing up column 5 is the right move. After moving to (5,2), Remedy at (5,3) is adjacent - attack it.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward own backline. I'm at (5,5), allies are at (5,3) and below. Moving west toward (3,5) or (4,5) moves me away from the Ghost at (5,4) and away from Remedy at (5,3). (3,5) is furthest from current position and allies. I'll move to (3,5) and wait since I have no useful targets in range there.
  State: Ghost 2/4, Rampart 7/8, Longshot 2/4, Bastion 5/8, Remedy 13/16 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(5,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP, cloaked. Remedy is adjacent at (5,3) — easy shadow_strike target that won't break cloak. After striking Remedy, I can move to (4,5) which puts me behind Bastion. Shadow_strike Remedy first to damage the healer, then reposition.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at 5/8 HP and needs healing, but is at distance 4 - not adjacent. Rampart enemy is adjacent at (5,2). My patch and overclock are blocked when adjacent to an enemy. I need to move away from Rampart to unblock abilities, then try to get closer to Bastion. Moving to (4,4) gets me away from Rampart and closer to Bastion (dist would be ~2). From (4,4) I'm not adjacent to any enemy so abilities are unblocked. But Bastion is still at (3,5) - distance 2 from (4,4), still not adjacent. Best I can do is move toward Bastion. Move to (4,4) reduces distance to Bastion to 2. Still can't heal. Or move to (3,4) - distance to Bastion at (3,5) would be 1, adjacent! That lets me patch Bastion. (3,4) is in valid moves. From (3,4) no enemies are adjacent (Rampart at (5,2) is dist 3, Ghost at (4,5) is dist 2). So I can move to (3,4) then patch Bastion at (3,5).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range at dist 4-5. I need to close distance to get Remedy in range (dist 2). Moving to (4,3) brings me 2 closer on y-axis, putting Remedy at dist 2 and Bastion at dist 3. From (4,3) Remedy at (3,4) would be distance ~1.4 tiles - within range 2. Let me move north to (4,3) to get into precision_shot range of Remedy.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,5) and wounded — attack to finish it. Then shield_wall facing East to protect Remedy at (3,4) from the enemy cluster (Longshot at (4,3), Rampart at (5,2)). Staying put preserves Fortify.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Ghost is critical at (4,5) and Bastion is nearby at (3,5) - I need to push forward to protect Ghost and engage the enemy cluster. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer and in range next turn. Longshot is at (4,3) so I should move to (5,4) to advance while staying near allies. Actually, moving to (5,4) then shield_wall facing W/N toward the enemy cluster at (3,4)-(3,5) to protect Ghost and Longshot from Bastion. Shield_wall requires an adjacent ally target - Longshot is at (4,3), so if I move to (5,4), Longshot won't be adjacent. Move to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,3), then shield_wall N to protect against Bastion coming from north.
  State: Ghost 1/4, Rampart 7/8, Longshot 2/4, Bastion 8/8, Remedy 11/16 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): overclock(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at full HP so no healing needed. Ghost is critical and adjacent to Bastion at (4,5). I'm at (3,4). I can move to (4,4) to get adjacent to both Bastion and potentially attack Ghost, but patch is blocked when adjacent to enemies. Staying at (3,4) keeps me safe. Bastion is healthy so overclock would be useful - but Bastion is a sentinel at spd1, not ideal for overclock. No friendly striker/specter in range. I have no adjacent allies to overclock from current position - Bastion is at (3,5) which is adjacent to me. I can overclock Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn which could be useful for the sentinel. Orders say to overclock striker or specter when no healing needed, but no friendly striker/specter is adjacent. Overclock Bastion as the best available option.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(3,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, cloaked, behind Bastion at (3,5). I'm already in position — shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. Use shadow_strike on Bastion now, then move to (4,4) to get behind Remedy for next turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy is at dist=2, in range for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved yet so no penalty. At 2HP I need to deal damage fast. Remedy is healthy but a medic kill denies enemy healing. I'll stay put and use precision_shot on Remedy, then wait since I have no other viable high-value action.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is at (4,4), dist=2, critical HP — need to close to adjacent to attack. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Ghost at (4,4). With OVERCLOCKED I get 2 ability uses. Attack Ghost to finish them off, then shield_wall facing S toward the enemy cluster (Longshot at (4,3), Rampart at (4,2)).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 3, out of attack range. Longshot is wounded at (4,3) just north of me. I should push forward toward the enemy cluster. Moving to (4,4) gets me adjacent to Longshot and closes distance to Bastion at (4,5). From (4,4) I can attack Bastion. Let me move north to (4,4) and attack Bastion.
  State: Rampart 7/8, Longshot 2/4, Bastion 6/8, Remedy 10/16 | Dead: Ghost, Ghost

### Turn 9 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → patch(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at (4,5) with 6/8 HP and needs a heal. I'm at (3,4) and Bastion is dist=2, not adjacent. Rampart is adjacent at (4,4) — patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I need to move away from Rampart first to get patch unblocked, then get adjacent to Bastion. Moving to (3,5) puts me dist=1 from Bastion at (4,5) and no longer adjacent to Rampart. Then I can patch Bastion.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 2HP, Bastion is at (4,5) distance 2 - in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Bastion is healthy so 2dmg won't kill, but it's the best damage available. Remedy is at (3,5) distance 3 - out of precision_shot range (max 2). I should fire precision_shot at Bastion first (full 2dmg since I haven't moved), then consider repositioning. Actually, if I shoot first then move, I avoid the 1dmg penalty. Shoot Bastion with precision_shot for 2dmg, then move to (5,3) to maintain distance from threats.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) S ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (4,4) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Rampart is directly south, Longshot is at (5,3) — both are south/southeast. I should attack Rampart (adjacent, in range) and then shield_wall facing south to block incoming damage while staying fortified. If I don't move, I keep fortify passive. Attack first, then shield_wall S to cover both enemies to the south.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,5) - attack immediately. I'm fortified (50% DR) and only at 6/8 HP. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. After attacking Bastion, use shield_wall facing North to protect against further attacks from the enemy cluster above. Longshot is wounded at (5,3) and could benefit from shield coverage.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): patch(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at 6/8 HP and adjacent to me at (4,5). I have 1 heal remaining. Rampart is adjacent to Bastion at (4,4), which means Bastion is in danger. I should patch Bastion to keep the frontliner alive. The patch range requires adjacency - Bastion is at (4,5) and I'm at (3,5), so we are adjacent. However, Rampart at (4,4) is distance 2 from me, not adjacent, so patch is not blocked. I'll patch Bastion first, then wait since I'm already in a good support position.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✗ Out of range → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 2HP, Bastion is at (4,5) dist=3 which is in range. Bastion is healthy so precision_shot for 2dmg is ideal. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire at Bastion first, then consider repositioning.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,5) to my north. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Remedy is also at (3,5). I should attack Bastion and then shield_wall facing north to protect against both enemies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) S ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (4,4) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing S to protect Remedy behind me and block Rampart's attacks.
  State: Rampart 5/8, Longshot 2/4, Bastion 7/8, Remedy 10/16 | Dead: Ghost, Ghost

### Turn 11 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): overclock(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Bastion is wounded at (4,5) but I can't heal. Rampart is adjacent to Bastion at (4,4). I should overclock Bastion to help them deal with Rampart. I'm at (3,5), Bastion is at (4,5) - adjacent, so overclock is valid if no enemy is adjacent to me. Rampart is at (4,4), dist=2 from me, so not adjacent to me. Overclock is available.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5 and 6). I'm at 2HP so need to be careful. Moving toward enemies to get in range - Bastion is at (4,5), moving to (4,2) gets me closer (dist 3) but still out of range 2. Let me move to (4,2) to close distance while maintaining some safety. Still won't be in range after move. Best I can do is advance toward the cluster at (4,5)/(3,5).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,5). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing North to protect against further advances from that direction. Both enemies are to my north.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) S ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (4,4). I'm fortified with overclocked (2 ability uses). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing south to protect Remedy from Rampart and Longshot's direction. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): overclock(4,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Bastion is wounded at (4,5) and needs help, but I cannot heal. I can overclock Bastion to give them 2 abilities next turn — this is valuable since they're a frontliner in combat. I need to be adjacent to Bastion to use overclock. I'm at (3,5) and Bastion is at (4,5), so we're already adjacent. However, Rampart is at (4,4) which is adjacent to me at (3,5) — dist=2 means not directly adjacent, so overclock should not be blocked. I'll use overclock on Bastion first, then move to a safer position away from Rampart.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (4,5), dist=3, which is out of my range-2 abilities. I need to close to range 2 or less. Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist=2 from Bastion at (4,5), enabling precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Bastion is healthy so 2dmg won't kill but it chips away. Ally Rampart is at (4,4) between me and Bastion - need to check LoS. Moving to (3,3) gives dist=2 from Bastion and avoids being directly behind Rampart. Actually (4,3) is directly south of Rampart at (4,4) and Bastion at (4,5) - LoS should be clear since I'm shooting through open space to Bastion. Let me move to (4,3) to get in range, then precision_shot Bastion.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent to the north at (4,5). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Longshot is wounded behind me at (4,3) and needs protection. I should attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing North to block damage to myself and protect Longshot from Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction and overclocked for 2 ability uses. Rampart is adjacent at (4,4) and wounded — I should attack twice. Staying in place keeps fortify active. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing south to protect against the cluster at (4,3)-(4,4).

### Turn 13 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → overclock(4,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is exhausted (0/3). Bastion is wounded at (4,5) dist=2, not adjacent. I need to close distance to use overclock on Bastion. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (4,5), then I can overclock them to help them fight better next turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded and at distance 2 — exactly in precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Bastion is wounded so this likely kills it. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire first, then assess.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/8 HP but fortified (50% DR) and overclocked (2 ability uses). Rampart is adjacent at (4,4) and wounded. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I'll attack Rampart twice with both ability uses to finish them off or heavily wound them. No need to move — staying put preserves Fortify bonus and keeps me in attack range.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 At 1HP I'm critical but fortified gives 50% damage reduction. Bastion is adjacent at (4,5) and wounded - attack now to finish them. Stay in place to keep fortify bonus. Shield_wall facing N to protect Longshot behind me at (4,3) doesn't help since enemy is N of me. Attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing N toward enemy cluster.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is critically wounded at 2/8 HP adjacent to me, but I have 0 heals remaining — patch is unavailable. Overclock would give Bastion 2 abilities next turn, but with only 2HP they may not survive. I can't heal, so I should try to attack Rampart (critical, dist=2 from my position) to help protect Bastion. Rampart is at (4,4), I'm at (3,5) — that's distance 2, within my melee+1 reach. Wait, my attack range is adjacent only (dist=1). I need to move closer to attack. Moving to (4,5) would put me adjacent to both Bastion and Rampart. But Bastion is already at (4,5). I can move to (3,4) to get adjacent to Rampart at (4,4). Then attack Rampart to help finish them off. Overclock on Bastion could help but Bastion is almost dead. Best play: move to (3,4) to be adjacent to Rampart, then attack Rampart to try to eliminate the threat.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at critical HP at distance 2 — priority target for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved, so no penalty. No adjacent enemies blocking the shot. Fire on Bastion to eliminate, then wait or hold position.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 1HP I'm critically low. Longshot is 2 tiles away at (4,3) and I'm fortified for 50% damage reduction. Moving to (4,4) closes to adjacent range so I can attack, but losing fortify is dangerous at 1HP. Better to stay fortified and use shield_wall facing S to protect Remedy at (3,4) from Longshot's fire. Staying put preserves fortify and my 50% reduction may keep me alive one more round.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → overclock(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at 1/8 HP and critically wounded, but patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I cannot heal. Bastion is at (4,5), distance 2. I should move adjacent to Bastion to use overclock, giving them 2 abilities next turn to potentially finish off Longshot or survive. Move to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (4,5) and also adjacent to Longshot at (4,3) — risky. Move to (3,5) is distance 1 from Bastion at (4,5), adjacent. Then overclock Bastion. But wait — overclock is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Longshot is at (4,3). If I move to (4,4), I'm adjacent to Longshot which blocks overclock. If I move to (3,5), distance to Longshot is sqrt((4-3)^2+(3-5)^2)=sqrt(5)~2.2, not adjacent, so overclock works. Move to (3,5), then overclock Bastion at (4,5).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Bastion is critical and only 2 tiles away at (4,5). I can use precision_shot for 2dmg to finish them off. I haven't moved yet so no penalty. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is not blocked. After killing Bastion, I should reposition away from Remedy.

### Turn 16 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies adjacent to overclock. Enemy Longshot is at dist=4, out of my melee range. I should move toward allies to support with overclock when possible. Moving south/toward center to stay useful.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Remedy is at (3,3), distance 2, healthy. I'm at (4,2) with 2HP. I have clear LoS and haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Remedy is healthy (likely 3-4HP for a medic), so 2dmg won't kill but will wound. No adjacent enemies blocking precision_shot. Best play: precision_shot Remedy first, then evaluate position. After shooting, I can reposition if needed.

### Turn 17 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies adjacent to overclock. Longshot is out of range at dist 3. I should reposition to stay near Remedy (my frontliner) to support with overclock when possible.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy is wounded and in range at distance 2. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire now to finish them off.

### Turn 18 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). No allies adjacent to overclock. Longshot is the only enemy, wounded at (5,2), distance 2. I should attack if possible. Attack range is adjacent only (dist 1), so I need to move adjacent to Longshot first. Move to (5,3) to get adjacent, then attack.
- **Longshot** (striker): suppressing_fire(5,3) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Remedy is adjacent at (5,3), distance 1. precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I can use attack (1dmg, adjacent only) but Remedy is wounded - need to check HP. With 1HP myself I need to kill fast. Attack deals 1dmg. Suppressing_fire deals 1dmg at target in 2-tile line range ≤2 tiles - Remedy is at dist 1 so in range, and suppressing_fire is NOT blocked by adjacency unlike precision_shot. Use suppressing_fire on Remedy to deal 1dmg and slow. If Remedy is wounded (low HP), this might finish them.
  State: Longshot 1/4, Remedy 7/16 | Dead: Ghost, Rampart, Bastion, Ghost

### Turn 19 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm a Medic with 0 heals remaining and suppressed (movement reduced to 1). I'm at (5,3) facing E, with Longshot at (4,2) critical and adjacent-ish. No patch available. I should try to use overclock on an ally if adjacent, but checking - Remedy(medic) is the other unit in order. I need to check if any ally is adjacent. My valid moves are (4,3), (5,2), (5,4). Longshot enemy is at (4,2) critical - if I move to (4,3) I'd be adjacent to the enemy which would block overclock. I don't see any allies listed as adjacent. Best to wait or move away. Moving to (5,4) keeps distance from enemy. Since no allies are adjacent for overclock and no heals remain, I'll wait to conserve position.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 Remedy is wounded at (5,4), dist=3 which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 means out of range for precision_shot which needs ≤2 tiles). I need to close distance. Moving to (5,3) puts me dist=1 from Remedy, but I'm at 1HP - risky. Moving to (4,3) gives dist=2 from (5,4) which is exactly range 2 for precision_shot. From (4,3) to (5,4): dx=1, dy=1, dist=sqrt(2)≈1.4, so within 2 tiles. I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg - but Remedy is wounded so likely low HP. Take the shot from (4,3).
