Scanning Hawk again would reveal nothing new (already known) but deals 1dmg to a critical unit, potentially helping. Actually scan does dmg even on known targets — worth using on Hawk to chip it.

I can move to (4,2) to get closer and place a trap, but that puts me adjacent to Warden enabling Denial but also risking attack. Better to stay at range and place trap on (4,2) which Warden must pass through to reach me, or (5,1) to cover southern approach.

Grid is at (5,3), so (5,2) would be adjacent — that's fine per the CAUTION note which says Grid's abilities block MY abilities if I'm adjacent, but I can still move there. Actually the CAUTION says 'avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked' — so I should not go to (5,2). Instead move to (4,2) or (5,1) to advance without going adjacent. Moving to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Grid at (5,3) — avoid that. Move to (4,3) to advance while staying 2 tiles from Grid at (5,3) (dist = sqrt(1+0)=1... no, (4,3) to (5,3) is dist 1, also adjacent).
