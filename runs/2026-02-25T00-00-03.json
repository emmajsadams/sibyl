Phantom is critical at (3,3) — killing it is high value. I need to move away from Aegis first to get range, then use precision_shot on Phantom. Moving to (5,4) puts me at dist 2 from Phantom (3,3) — sqrt((5-3)^2+(4-3)^2)=sqrt(5)~2.2, actually dist=2 tiles away. Wait, dist is Chebyshev: max(|5-3|,|4-3|)=max(2,1)=2. So Phantom at (3,3) would be at dist 2 from (5,4). Aegis at (3,4) would be at dist 2 from (5,4) — no longer adjacent. Precision_shot at range ≤2 works. But I moved, so it does 1dmg. Phantom is critical — even 1dmg should finish it. Move to (5,4) first, then precision_shot Phantom at (3,3).",
