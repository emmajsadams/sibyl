Better to attack from current position at range 2, and consider moving to safer ground. Actually, attack hits at range=adjacent only (1 tile). Pulse hits all within 1 tile AoE. Rampart is at dist=2 - not in pulse range from current pos. I can move to (3,5) to be adjacent to Rampart (dist=1), then pulse to hit Rampart for 1dmg (could finish a critical unit).

Trap at (3,5) could catch movement. Actually with 2HP I need to eliminate threats fast. Move to (3,5), then pulse - Rampart at (2,5) is within 1 tile, deals 1dmg.
