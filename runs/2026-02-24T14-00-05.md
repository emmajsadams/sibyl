## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Seer** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Snare** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(0,1) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are far away (dist 6-8), so I should cloak first then advance toward the center/enemy side. Moving to (0,4) gets me closer to enemy lines while staying on the left flank. Cloaked movement will let me infiltrate safely.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → recalibrate(4,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist=5, max=4). I need to close distance to get them in scan range. Moving south toward enemies would help, but I must stay behind allies and avoid getting adjacent to enemy vectors. Phantom is at (4,5) and Snare at (2,5) - I'm already behind them at (3,4). Moving to (3,2) gets me closer while keeping allies between me and enemies. Then I can recalibrate Phantom (specter) to boost effectiveness since they're my damage dealer.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(4,5) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, tip says to cloak now. Both enemies are 7 tiles away, out of range. I should cloak immediately and move toward Hawk at (1,1) to close distance while invisible. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer while staying on the board.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Seer is at dist=3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles? No, dist=3 exceeds range 2). Need to move closer. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist=2 from Seer at (3,2), enabling precision_shot. I won't be adjacent to any enemy Vector (Snare is far away), so precision_shot is not blocked.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(2,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far. Hawk is at (2,2) moving north toward me at (2,5). Most likely path for Hawk is straight up column 2. I should move down to (2,3) to stay near allies at (3,3) and (3,2), then place a trap at (2,2) or (2,1) to intercept Hawk's advance. Actually Hawk is already at (2,2) so I should trap a tile they'll move through next turn. If Hawk moves north toward me, (2,3) or (2,4) are likely paths. I can move to (2,3) first, then trap (2,4) — but wait, I'd be standing at (2,3) and trapping (2,4) which is within 2 tiles. Or I stay at (2,5) and trap (2,3) which is 2 tiles away (dist=2, within range). That blocks the approach corridor. Viper is at (2,0), far away. Let me trap (2,3) from current position — that's exactly 2 tiles south, within trap range.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1 opening. I'm at (2,0) facing N. Seer is at (3,2) dist=3, Snare is at (1,4) dist=5. Both out of range. I should move toward the center to establish control and place a trap on a chokepoint. Moving to (2,1) puts me closer to center. Then I can trap (3,2) or a tile between enemies and allies. Seer is at (3,2) so trapping (3,1) would be a chokepoint they might cross. Move to (3,1) to get closer, then trap (3,2) to threaten Seer's position.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Ghost 4/4, Viper 9/9, Snare 9/9, Phantom 4/4, Seer 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper which blocks my scan ability. I need to reposition to escape the denial zone. Moving to (3,4) gets me away from both enemies and keeps me behind Phantom at (3,3). From there I can scan next turn. I cannot use scan now due to Viper's denial zone. I'll move away and wait since no abilities are usable.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining - I need to use it this turn before it expires. Priority target is Hawk at (2,2). I can move to (2,1) which is behind Hawk (they face N, so behind = south of them). From (2,1) I'm adjacent and behind, so I can use breach on Hawk. But wait - there's a trap at (2,3). Moving to (2,1) requires passing through (2,3) which has a trap. Let me check valid moves - (2,1) IS in valid moves list, so I can reach it. Move to (2,1) first, then breach Hawk from behind. Breach makes them obey me next turn, which is powerful. I'm currently cloaked and cloak breaks on attack but NOT on breach - so I can breach while cloaked and stay invisible! This is ideal.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and adjacent to Snare (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities. I cannot use shadow_strike or breach here. I should move to (1,5) which puts me behind Snare, then next turn I can breach or shadow_strike from behind. Moving to (1,5) first gets me out of the denial zone and positions me behind Snare for a breach next turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,1) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (2,1) — this blocks precision_shot per Vector denial rules? No, Phantom is a specter, not a Vector. The warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Snare is the Vector at dist=3, not adjacent. So precision_shot is available. However, Phantom is at dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles but deals 1dmg if I moved. If I don't move, I get full 2dmg on Phantom. Phantom is healthy so won't kill, but 2dmg is good pressure. I'll use precision_shot first without moving, dealing 2dmg to Phantom at (2,1). Then I can move away to create distance — move to (3,2) or (2,3) to get range on other targets while avoiding Snare adjacency.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(2,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (2,1) - my Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. I can attack Phantom for 1dmg, or use pulse to hit them. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Phantom is at dist 1, so pulse would hit them. Attack also works at adjacent range. I want to move to control the corridor between enemies. Moving to (4,2) or (4,1) puts me in a better position to drop a trap covering approaches from Snare at (1,4). Actually, Phantom is right next to me - I should attack them and then reposition. Let me attack Phantom first, then move to (4,1) to place myself where I can trap the approach path next turn. Or: move first to (2,2) then attack Phantom who would be at dist 1 from (2,2). Actually from current pos (3,1), Phantom at (2,1) is adjacent - I can attack now. Then move toward chokepoint. Let me attack Phantom then move to (4,2) to set up trap coverage next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(1,4) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (1,5) - that's a prime pulse target. I'm at (1,4) so pulse hits Ghost directly. There's already a trap at (2,3). I should pulse Ghost now for 1 damage, then move to reposition. Moving to (0,3) or (0,4) keeps me away from Ghost while I can place a trap on a likely path. Ghost is at (1,5) moving south likely toward allies. I'll pulse first to damage Ghost, then move south-west to (0,3) to place a trap on (1,3) next turn or deny the corridor.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Ghost 3/4, Viper 9/9, Snare 9/9, Phantom 2/4, Seer 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,1) with 2HP, cloaked. Priority target is Hawk at (3,3). Behind-Hawk position is (3,2) which is reachable and adjacent. I can move to (3,2) to get behind Hawk, then use breach to take control. This is ideal — breach from behind, make Hawk waste their turn. Viper is at (4,2) which is adjacent to (3,2), but breach cooldown is ready and I need to check if Viper blocks it. Viper denial range is adjacent — (3,2) is adjacent to (4,2), so breach would be blocked there. Alternative: move to (3,1) instead, which keeps distance from Viper while still being close to Hawk. From (3,1), Hawk at (3,3) is dist=2, but I need to be adjacent for shadow_strike or behind for breach. (3,2) is the only behind+adjacent tile for Hawk but Viper blocks abilities there. I'll move to (3,2) and use shadow_strike instead — shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1 damage. Wait, is Viper adjacent to (3,2)? Viper is at (4,2), and (3,2) is 1 tile away — yes, adjacent. So cloak/breach blocked. But shadow_strike is not blocked by Vector denial (only cloak/breach are blocked). Shadow_strike from (3,2) on Hawk at (3,3) — that's adjacent, valid. Move to (3,2), shadow_strike Hawk. This deals 1 damage and keeps cloak.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) uncloaked with 3HP. Snare is at (0,3) facing S — behind tile is (0,4) which is reachable in 1 move. If I move to (0,4), I'll be adjacent and behind Snare, enabling breach. But Snare is a Vector — moving adjacent will block cloak/breach. Wait, the caution says avoid moving adjacent because abilities will be blocked. So breach at (0,4) adjacent to Snare would be blocked by Vector denial. Shadow_strike is still an attack though — it keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. I can't shadow_strike without cloak benefit anyway. My best option: move toward Snare's behind tile to set up for next turn, staying out of Vector denial range. Actually (0,4) is adjacent to Snare at (0,3) — Vector blocks abilities when adjacent. So I can't breach from there. I need to reconsider. Phantom at (3,2) is wounded — best target but unreachable this turn. Seer at (3,4) has no reachable behind options. I should reposition toward Phantom or Seer. Move to (2,4) gets me closer to Seer at (3,4) — dist would be 2. Or move to (2,3) to be closer to both Phantom and Seer. Let me move to (2,4) to close distance on Seer, then next turn potentially get behind them.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with Hawk adjacent at (3,3) and Ghost adjacent at (2,4). Viper is 3 tiles away at (4,2) — must avoid getting adjacent to Viper. I need to scan a priority target to reveal their strategy. Ghost and Hawk are both in scan range at dist=1. I should scan Ghost (specter) since spectres are stealthy and unpredictable. Then I should move away from Hawk who is adjacent and threatening. Moving to (4,4) keeps distance from Viper (who would be 2+ tiles away) and gets me away from Hawk. Actually, moving to (4,5) puts me further from Viper at (4,2) — that's 3 tiles away still safe. Or (5,4) — Viper at (4,2) would be dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, not adjacent, safe. Let me move to (4,5) to reposition safely while scanning Ghost first.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent (dist=1) at (3,2), which means precision_shot is blocked by adjacency rules for Striker vs Vector — wait, that's for Vector enemies, not Specter. Phantom is a specter at dist=1 (adjacent). precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and LoS, but I need to check if being adjacent blocks it. The warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — Phantom is a specter, so no block. Phantom is wounded, so 2dmg from precision_shot should finish it. I'm at (3,3), Phantom at (3,2) — dist=1, within range. Fire precision_shot at Phantom first to eliminate it, then move to (3,4) to gain distance from Snare and improve positioning.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is critical and adjacent at (3,2). Attack to finish them off. Then place a trap at (3,3) to cover the approach between allies at (3,4)/(2,4) and enemy positions.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at (0,3), no enemies in range. There's already a trap at (2,3). Ghost is wounded at (2,4) moving south - likely to step through (2,3) trap already placed. Hawk is at (3,4) moving toward us. I should move northeast to get closer and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (1,4) gets me closer to Ghost and Hawk's approach corridor. Then place a trap at (2,4) or nearby - Ghost is at (2,4) so I can't place there. Place trap at (1,3) or advance and trap (2,3) area. Actually (2,3) already has trap. Move to (1,3) and place trap at (2,4) - but Ghost is there. Move to (0,4) and place trap at (1,4) to intercept Hawk/Ghost movement southward.
  State: Hawk 3/4, Ghost 2/4, Viper 9/9, Snare 9/9, Seer 5/6 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): attack(1,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare with DENIAL active, so cloak and breach are blocked. I can only use basic attack or move. With 2HP I need to be careful. Snare is right next to me at (1,4). My ally Hawk is at (3,4) also adjacent to Snare. Best play: shadow_strike Snare (it works through denial as it's a basic-adjacent attack? Actually denial blocks abilities — but shadow_strike IS an ability). So I'm limited to basic attack or move. I'll attack Snare with basic attack to deal 1 damage, then move to (1,3) to get behind Snare for a potential breach next turn. Wait — attack breaks cloak but I'm not cloaked. Attack Snare first, then move to (1,3) behind Snare.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is in scan range at dist=2 and hasn't been scanned yet - revealing their strategy is high priority. Viper is at dist=3 so I'm not adjacent (safe from denial). I should scan Hawk to reveal their prompt. After scanning, I can recalibrate Snare who is my ally damage dealer - but Snare is at (1,4) which is not adjacent to me at (4,5). I could move closer to Snare to recalibrate, but staying at range is safer. Scanning Hawk is the clear first move. For second action, I'll move to (5,5) to maintain distance from Viper and stay safe.
- **Hawk** (striker): suppressing_fire(1,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 2HP, facing Snare(vector) at (1,4) dist=2 and Seer(oracle) at (5,5) dist=3. Snare is healthy so precision_shot won't finish it, but I can use suppressing_fire to slow Snare and keep it at bay. Seer is out of range (dist=3, max range=2). I need to avoid moving adjacent to Snare or my precision_shot gets blocked. Suppressing_fire on Snare from current position: target (1,4), fires a 2-tile line. This will deal 1dmg and slow Snare. I should stay put or move away from Snare. Moving to (4,4) keeps distance from Snare and stays safe. Actually, I can fire suppressing_fire first from current position at Snare, then move away to (4,5) to increase distance from threats.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2), no enemies in range. There's already a trap at (3,3). Orders say to place traps between enemy positions and allies. Snare is at (1,4) and Ghost is at (1,3) - they're adjacent, so Ghost is in danger. Seer is at (5,5), Hawk is at (4,5) - Seer threatens Hawk. I should move north toward (4,4) to get closer to the action, then place a trap at (4,4) or (5,4) to create a chokepoint between Seer and the battlefield. Moving to (4,4) puts me closer to both threats and I can trap the approach path from Seer.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(1,3) ✓ → trap(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed (movement reduced to 1) and Ghost is adjacent at (1,3) - wounded and right next to me. There's already a trap at (2,3). I should attack Ghost directly since it's in range and wounded. Then I can place a trap to deny further movement. Moving to (0,4) or (2,4) would give me positioning options but Ghost is the immediate threat. Attack Ghost first, then place a trap on a tile it might retreat through. Ghost is at (1,3) moving south - if it retreats it might go to (0,3) or (1,2). I'll attack Ghost (it's wounded, might finish it or soften it), then place a trap at (1,2) to block its escape route southward.
  State: Hawk 2/4, Ghost 1/4, Viper 9/9, Snare 7/9, Seer 5/6 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 5 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded — but I'm an Oracle and attack only does 1dmg at adjacent range. Viper is at dist=2, so I'm not adjacent to it (safe from denial). I already have Hawk and Ghost scanned. Viper is healthy and unscanned at dist=2 — scanning it would reveal its strategy. I should scan Viper (dist=2, within range 4, not adjacent to Viper so scan isn't blocked). Then I need to reposition away from Hawk who is adjacent and will likely target me. Valid moves: I can move to (3,5) or (3,4) to create distance from Hawk while staying away from Viper. Move to (3,5) keeps me at range from Hawk and away from Viper at (4,4). Order: scan Viper first, then move to (3,5) to create distance.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(1,4) ✓ → attack(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 1HP, adjacent to Snare at (1,4) who has DENIAL active blocking cloak/breach. I'm already behind Snare (facing N, I'm at (1,3) which is south of them). With only 1HP I need to eliminate Snare fast. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked. Basic attack deals 1dmg. Snare is healthy so needs multiple hits. I should use shadow_strike on Snare (adjacent, no cloak required to use it, just keeps cloak if already cloaked). Actually shadow_strike range is adjacent only — Snare is adjacent. Use shadow_strike first, then if Snare survives, attack. Wait — shadow_strike says range:adjacent only. Snare is at dist=1 so adjacent. Use shadow_strike on Snare to deal 1dmg without breaking any cloak state. Then attack for another 1dmg to finish them (they're healthy = full HP which for vector is likely 3HP). Actually I only have 1HP so I need to act offensively. Shadow_strike then attack on Snare.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Seer is adjacent at (3,5). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Seer is an oracle, not a vector. However, precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2, and Seer is at dist=1. But wait - precision_shot deals 1dmg if I moved. Best play: use precision_shot first (no move penalty, full 2dmg) on adjacent Seer. Then move away to (5,5) to create distance and avoid being adjacent next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(1,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical and adjacent at (1,3) - perfect target for attack to finish it off. Traps at (2,3) and (0,3) already block flanking routes. After attacking Ghost, I should move away from the trap at (0,3) and stay mobile. Viper is 3 tiles away so no denial threat yet. Priority: kill Ghost with attack, then reposition.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4). Snare is at (2,4) dist=2, Seer at (3,5) dist=2. Trap at (3,3) already placed. I should place a trap at (5,4) - wait, that's already a trap too. Valid moves include (4,5) and (5,3). I need to control the space between enemies and Hawk at (5,5). Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Seer at (3,5) which risks denial if they're a vector - but Seer is oracle, not vector, so no denial concern. Actually Snare is the vector with denial. Moving to (3,4) would put me adjacent to Snare and get denied. Stay at (4,4) and place a trap at (4,5) to block path to Hawk. Or pulse Snare+Seer if they cluster. Both enemies are dist=2 so pulse won't reach them. Best: place trap at (4,5) to block enemy advance toward Hawk, since Hawk is at (5,5) wounded. Trap at (4,5) covers the approach.
  State: Hawk 2/4, Viper 8/9, Snare 5/9, Seer 4/6 | Dead: Ghost, Phantom

### Turn 6 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(2,4) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and within scan range at distance 2 (already scanned, prompt known). Foresight shows Hawk used precision_shot on my position (3,5) last turn - dangerous. Viper placed a trap at (4,5) last turn. I should avoid (4,5). My ally Snare is at (2,4) wounded and is a damage dealer I should recalibrate. I'm already at (3,5), Snare is adjacent at (2,4) - I can recalibrate Snare to boost effectiveness against Hawk. Then move to maintain safety. Recalibrate range is adjacent only - Snare at (2,4) is adjacent to me at (3,5)? Distance is 1 tile diagonally... checking: |3-2|=1, |5-4|=1, so Chebyshev distance = 1, which counts as adjacent. I'll recalibrate Snare with attack priority on Hawk, then move away from Hawk's precision_shot range while avoiding trap at (4,5).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,5) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is in range at dist 3 and healthy. Snare is wounded but out of range at dist 4. I'm at 2/4 HP so I need to be careful. Priority is precision_shot on Seer since they're in range. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2 damage. No enemies adjacent to me, so precision_shot isn't blocked. After shooting, I should consider repositioning but staying to shoot is valuable.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 5/9 HP. Hawk is wounded at (5,5) and is the priority target, but dist=4 so I need to close. Valid moves include (4,4) which gets me to dist=2 from Hawk. I should move to (4,4) to close distance. From there I still can't attack Hawk (need adjacent for attack, range 2 for trap). I can't place a trap at my current position (2,4) since I need to move first. After moving to (4,4), I'm still not in range of either enemy for abilities. Let me place a trap at (4,5) - wait, orders say avoid (4,5). Instead, place trap at (3,5) or (3,4) to cover enemy approach paths. Actually from (4,4) I can place trap at range ≤2, so (4,5) is warned off, but (3,5) or (5,4) would be good chokepoints. Moving to (4,4) puts me dist=2 from Hawk. I'll move to (4,4) then place trap at (3,5) to cover the approach corridor.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (4,4) dist=2, wounded. Seer is far at (2,5). There's already a trap at (5,4) and (4,5). I should place a trap to control the area while staying out of Snare's denial range (adjacent only). I can place a trap at (4,3) to block Snare's movement south, then stay at current position or move to safety. Valid moves include (4,3) but that would put me adjacent to Snare at (4,4) - dangerous. I can pulse from current position (5,3) to hit Snare at (4,4) since pulse hits all within 1 tile - wait, dist=2 so pulse won't reach. I could place a trap at (4,2) after moving there, or place trap at (3,3) from current... but trap range is ≤2 tiles. (3,3) is dist=sqrt(4+0)=2 from me, valid. I'll place trap at (4,3) from current position - that's within range 2. Then wait or move to maintain pressure without getting adjacent to Snare.
  State: Hawk 2/4, Viper 8/9, Snare 5/9, Seer 4/6 | Dead: Ghost, Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and within scan range (dist 3, ≤4). Already scanned Hawk so no need to rescan. Viper is out of range at dist 5. Snare is wounded at (4,4) — recalibrate could help them. I'm at (2,5), Snare at (4,4). Recalibrate is adjacent only, so I'd need to be next to Snare. (3,4) is adjacent to Snare at (4,4) and is a valid move tile. But (3,5) has a trap. Moving to (3,4) puts me closer to Viper (dist ~3) but Viper is at (5,3), so (3,4) would be dist ~3. Viper's denial blocks adjacent abilities — at (3,4) I'd be distance ~2.8 from Viper, not adjacent. Recalibrating Snare to focus on Viper (the healthy threat controlling chokepoints) would be valuable. Move to (3,4) then recalibrate Snare at (4,4). This keeps me away from Hawk's precision_shot angle and boosts Snare.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is wounded at (4,4), distance 2 — precision_shot can finish it. I haven't moved yet so no movement penalty. Snare is not adjacent so no Vector block. Fire first, then wait or reassess.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with Snare at (4,4) wounded and dist=2. Traps are already at (3,3),(5,4),(4,3),(4,5). Snare is wounded - pulse would hit it for 1dmg since it's within 2 tiles... wait, pulse hits within 1 tile (adjacent). Snare is at dist=2, so not in pulse range. I can't place a trap adjacent to an enemy vector (Snare blocks trap). I need to move first to get away from Snare's denial range if I want to use trap. Moving to (5,2) gets me further from Snare. Then I could place a trap at (4,2) or similar to cut off routes. Actually, (5,4) already has a trap. Let me check valid moves: [3,3],[4,2],[4,3],[5,1],[5,2],[5,4]. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist=sqrt(0+4)=2 from Snare at (4,4), which is fine. From (4,2) I could place trap at (3,2) or (4,3) - but (4,3) already has a trap. Let me move to (5,2) and place trap at (4,2) to block Snare's movement path southward. Snare is wounded so I want to pressure it. Actually from (5,2) I can place trap at (4,2) which is within 2 range and not adjacent to me. This creates more area denial between Snare and our side.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(5,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded and in range from current position (dist=2). I can attack Hawk now without moving. After attacking, I should move to (5,4) to stay adjacent to Hawk for follow-up pressure, but (4,5) has a trap warning. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,5) which is good for next turn. Viper is at dist=3, not adjacent, so no denial risk. Attack Hawk first, then move to (5,4) to close in.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → recalibrate(5,4) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Hawk used precision_shot on (4,4) last turn. Hawk is wounded at (5,5) and within scan range (dist 3). I already know Hawk's prompt, so scan would be wasted there. Viper is at dist 4, out of range. My ally Snare is wounded at (5,4) — Hawk will likely target Snare again. I should recalibrate Snare to boost their effectiveness, but Snare is at (5,4) and I'm at (3,4) — not adjacent. I could move toward Snare to get adjacent, but (4,4) was targeted by Hawk last turn via precision_shot, so moving there is risky. Moving to (4,5) would put me adjacent to Snare and still within scan range of Hawk. But (3,5) has a trap — avoid. I can move to (4,5) which is valid (it's in valid moves list) and then recalibrate Snare at (5,4) — but wait, recalibrate is adjacent only, (4,5) to (5,4) is dist ~1.4, not adjacent (requires same row/col or diagonal? typically adjacent means distance 1 including diagonals). Distance from (4,5) to (5,4) is sqrt(2) — diagonal, so adjacent. That works. But Viper has denial on adjacent enemies — Viper is at (5,2), adjacent to (5,3) not to (4,5) or (5,4). So denial shouldn't block recalibrate there. Move to (4,5), then recalibrate Snare to attack Hawk.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone which blocks precision_shot. Both Snare and Seer are wounded and adjacent. I need to move away from Snare's denial first, then use precision_shot on a wounded enemy. Moving to (4,4) gets me away from Snare's denial zone, and from there I can target Seer at (4,5) with precision_shot for 2dmg (no move penalty if I shoot after moving... wait, I moved so it's 1dmg). Actually Seer is wounded so even 1dmg might finish them. Let me check: move to (4,4), then precision_shot Seer at (4,5) - dist=1, in range, LoS clear, not adjacent to Vector. That deals 1dmg (moved penalty) which may kill wounded Seer. Alternatively, basic attack Snare now while adjacent, then move away. Attack does 1dmg to wounded Snare which could kill them, freeing me from denial. Attack Snare first, then move to (3,5) to reposition safely.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Snare is at (5,4) critical and 2 tiles away - I need to avoid moving adjacent or my abilities get blocked. I can place a trap at (4,3) which is between Snare and my ally Hawk at (3,5), cutting off their path. Then I'll pulse Snare since they're within range 2 - wait, pulse only hits within 1 tile. Snare is 2 tiles away so pulse won't reach. Best play: place trap at (4,2) to block the chokepoint, then move to (4,1) to stay safe and maintain positioning. Actually (4,2) is listed as a valid move tile and also has a trap already. Let me place a trap at (4,1) - that's accessible. Better: place trap first at (4,3) from current position (5,2) - dist to (4,3) is 2, within trap range. Then move to (5,1) to get away from Snare's denial range while maintaining control.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (3,5) wounded and critical — priority kill. Orders say Hawk is at (5,5) but recon shows Hawk at (3,5). Valid moves include (5,5) which is adjacent to (3,5)... wait, (5,5) is in valid moves. From (5,5) Hawk at (3,5) is dist=2, still out of adjacent range for attack. Let me reconsider: I'm at (5,4), Hawk is at (3,5) dist=3. Moving to (5,5) puts me at dist=3 from (3,5). Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=2 from (3,5) — still not adjacent. I can't reach Hawk this turn. Viper is at (5,1) dist=3, also not reachable for attack. I should move closer to Hawk and place a trap on a likely path. Hawk is wounded/critical — moving toward us likely. (4,5) is noted as a trap to avoid (Seer is there). Moving to (4,4) closes distance to Hawk and I can place a trap at (3,4) or (4,3) to intercept Viper's likely northward movement. Viper at (5,1) moving north would pass through (5,2),(5,3). I can trap (5,3) from (5,5) or (5,2) from current. Move to (5,5) then trap (4,5)? No, avoid (4,5). Move to (5,5) and trap (5,3) — but (5,3) is 2 tiles from (5,5), within range. That blocks Viper's path north.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 3HP, critical. Hawk is adjacent at (3,5) and critical - dangerous. I need to move away from Hawk to avoid being attacked. Moving to (4,4) keeps distance from Hawk while staying near Snare at (5,5) for recalibrate. After moving, I can recalibrate Snare to boost their effectiveness against Viper who controls traps at chokepoints. I cannot scan Hawk since they're adjacent (scan blocked when adjacent? No, scan blocked when adjacent to Vector, not Striker). Actually scan is blocked by adjacent Vector - Viper is at (5,1), not adjacent. But Hawk is already scanned. I should recalibrate Snare since they're adjacent and critical - give them guidance to target Viper's traps or attack Viper. Move away from Hawk first, then recalibrate Snare.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 1HP - critical condition. Snare is at (5,5) dist=2 and critical, Seer is at (4,4) dist=2 and wounded. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Snare is critical - one precision_shot kills it. I'm not adjacent to Snare (dist=2) so precision_shot isn't blocked. Fire at Snare first to eliminate it, then I'm out of actions. No need to move since both targets are in range from current position.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 1HP - critical condition. Hawk is at (3,5) critical health, distance 2, within my attack range. Priority is to kill Hawk before Viper gets a turn. Attack range is ≤2 tiles (rng2), so Hawk at dist=2 is in range. Attack Hawk first. Note trap at (5,3) and (4,5) warning - avoid moving there. After attacking, I could wait or move but with 1HP I should focus on the kill shot. Valid moves are (4,5), (5,3), (5,4) - but (5,3) has a trap! (4,5) was warned to avoid. (5,4) is safe if needed. Attack Hawk now - if it's critical, one hit should finish it.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 4, out of range. Ally Hawk is at (3,5) critical. Traps already placed at (3,3),(4,3),(4,2). Move to (5,3) to close distance, then place a trap at (4,3) area or (5,4) to block enemy approach path toward Hawk. Moving to (5,3) brings me closer to the action. I'll place a trap at (4,4) wait - Seer is at (4,4) so I can't place there. Place trap at (5,4) to block the corridor between enemies and Hawk.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(5,5) ✓ → scan(3,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is critical and already scanned — Snare is also critical and needs support. Viper is adjacent threat blocking scan if I get too close. I'm at (4,4), Hawk is at (3,5) dist=2, Viper at (5,3) dist=2. I should recalibrate Snare at (5,5) which is adjacent to me — boost them to finish off Hawk. Then scan Hawk to deal 1 damage and potentially finish the critical target. Wait — Snare is at (5,5), I'm at (4,4), that's diagonal distance 1 (adjacent). Recalibrate requires adjacent. Yes, Snare is adjacent. Recalibrate Snare first to boost their attack on Hawk, then scan Hawk for 1 damage to help finish them.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2) → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Snare is critical at (5,5) dist=2, Seer is wounded at (4,4) dist=2. I have a trap at (5,4) already between me and Snare. I can pulse from current position to hit both Seer at (4,4) and potentially Snare — but pulse only hits within 1 tile, so neither is in range. Better to move to (5,4) — wait, that has a trap. Move to (4,3) — also trapped. Move to (5,2) to stay safe, then place a trap at (5,4) to block Snare's path... but (5,4) already has a trap. Let me reconsider: I'm at (5,3). Snare is critical at (5,5). If I move to (5,4) I'd be adjacent to Snare — dangerous and triggers my own trap. Seer at (4,4) is wounded. I can pulse from (5,3) — pulse hits all within 1 tile. Seer at (4,4) is dist=2, not in pulse range. Best play: place a trap at a clean tile to further deny movement. Valid moves include (5,2), (5,1). Place trap targeting a path tile. I'll trap (5,4) — already trapped. Try trapping near Seer's path. From current pos (5,3), I can trap tiles ≤2 away: (5,5) is 2 away — put trap there to finish Snare if they step on it, but Snare is already on (5,5). Can I trap an occupied tile? Likely not. Try (4,4) — Seer is there. Try (3,4) — empty, blocks Seer movement west. Or attack Seer at dist=2 within attack range? Attack is adjacent only. Use pulse — range 1 tile AoE, neither enemy in range. Best: move to (4,2) to reposition away from traps, then trap (4,3) or place at a strategic spot to control approach.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm Snare (vector) at (5,5) with 1HP — critically wounded. No enemies in range from current position. Viper is 3 tiles away at (5,2), out of range. Valid moves: (3,5),(4,5),(5,3),(5,4). Moving to (5,3) closes on Viper and gets me in attack range. But I have only 1HP — any hit kills me. Orders say attack Viper at (5,1)/(5,3) and move south. Moving to (5,3) puts me adjacent to Viper at (5,2) — I can then attack for 1dmg. But wait, trap at (4,5) warned to avoid. (5,3) is listed as a valid move tile. Move to (5,3) to get adjacent to Viper at (5,2), then attack.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(5,2) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 3HP, critical condition. Viper is at (5,2), distance 3 - within scan range and not adjacent so scan is not blocked. Already scanned Viper last turn but I can scan again for damage. Snare is critical at (5,3). My orders say scan priority targets. Viper is 3 tiles away so I must NOT move adjacent. I should recalibrate Snare to boost effectiveness since they're critical and need help, OR scan Viper for damage. Snare is adjacent at (5,3) - I can recalibrate them. Let me recalibrate Snare first to boost their effectiveness as damage dealer, then scan Viper to deal 1 damage. Wait - Foresight shows Viper tried to trap (3,4) last turn. I should avoid (3,4). My current position (4,4) is safe. Recalibrate Snare at (5,3) - they're adjacent? Distance from (4,4) to (5,3) is |5-4|+|3-4|=1+1=2, so NOT adjacent (need distance 1). So recalibrate won't work on Snare. Scan Viper at (5,2) distance 3 - in range, not adjacent to Viper so not blocked. I'll scan Viper for 1 damage. Then wait or move to maintain positioning. I should stay away from traps at (2,3) and (0,3). Stay at (4,4) or move to (4,5) to stay safe.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(5,2) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 1HP, adjacent to Viper at (5,2) who has DENIAL active blocking my trap ability. I'm wounded and critical. Viper is wounded too — I should attack it to try to eliminate it. I cannot use trap due to DENIAL. Attack Viper first, then if alive consider moving to safety or attacking again. Basic attack works even under DENIAL.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,1) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 4HP, enemies Snare@(4,4) and Seer@(4,5) both out of range. There are already traps at (5,4) and (4,3) blocking some paths. I should place a trap to control the approach corridor. Moving to (5,3) puts me closer but risks stepping on trap at (5,4)... wait, (5,3) is a valid move and not a trap location. Actually I need to place traps to funnel enemies. If I move to (5,1) and place a trap at (5,3) or (4,1), I create coverage while staying safer. Better: move to (4,1) and place trap at (4,2) which is a valid move tile — this blocks the southern approach. Actually (4,2) already has a trap. Let me move to (5,3) — no wait, traps are at (5,4) so moving to (5,3) is safe. From (5,3) I could trap (4,3) but that already has traps. Best: stay and trap (5,4) — but (5,4) already has a trap. Move to (3,2) and place trap at (4,2)? (4,2) already trapped. Move to (5,1) and trap (5,3) to block vertical corridor — (5,3) is valid and not trapped. This creates a barrier between me and enemies approaching from north.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(4,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Snare is critical and adjacent to me at (4,4). Viper is at (5,1), dist 5, out of scan range. My priority: recalibrate Snare to boost their effectiveness since they're my damage dealer and in critical condition. Then move to maintain positioning. Can't scan Viper (out of range, need ≤4 tiles). Recalibrate is adjacent only — Snare is at (4,4), I'm at (4,5), that's adjacent. Give Snare guidance to focus on Viper and avoid trap at (5,3).
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 1HP — extremely vulnerable. Viper is at (5,1), dist=4, out of range. No enemies are in attack range. Valid moves include (5,3) but that's a trap location — avoid it. I can move to (5,4) to close on Viper, then place a trap on (5,3) to deny that tile... wait, trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy Vector, and Viper has denial range only when adjacent. Viper is at (5,1), far enough away. But trap at (5,3) is already placed per orders. I should move toward Viper to engage. Move to (5,4) gets me closer. Then I could trap (5,3)... but orders say avoid (5,3) trap already there. Move to (5,4), then place trap at (5,2) to cut off Viper's movement northward — that's within 2 tiles of (5,4). Actually with 1HP I should play carefully. Move to (5,4) to threaten Viper next turn, and place trap at (5,2) to deny escape.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with 4HP. Seer is at (3,5), distance 6 - out of range. Traps already at (5,3) and nearby. I should move toward the enemy and place a trap to control the approach path. Moving to (5,3) is blocked by existing trap. Move to (4,2) to advance and then place a trap at (5,3) or (3,3) area to control chokepoints. Actually (4,2) is valid and from there I can trap to extend denial zone. Let me move to (4,2) and place trap at (4,3) - wait, (4,3) already has traps. Move to (5,2) and trap at (4,2) to cover approach. Better: move to (4,1) to advance, then trap at (4,2) to block the corridor toward allies.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(4,1) ✓
  💭 Viper is at (4,1), distance 5 — out of scan range (max 4). I have 3HP and need to be careful. Foresight shows Viper placed a trap at (4,2) last turn, so traps are at (2,3), (0,3), (5,2), (4,2). I should move closer to get Viper in scan range without getting adjacent. Moving to (3,2) puts me at distance 3 from (4,1) — within scan range. But (3,2) requires passing through (3,3) and (3,4) — check if path is clear of traps. No traps on those tiles. (3,2) is also not trapped. From (3,2), Viper at (4,1) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41, so distance 2 tiles — in range. Actually let me recalculate: dist from (3,2) to (4,1) = |3-4|+|2-1| = 1+1 = 2. That's in scan range. But wait — I need to avoid being adjacent to Viper (scan blocked). Distance 2 is not adjacent (adjacent = 1). Good. Move to (3,2), then scan Viper.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded at (3,2) distance 2 - within attack range. I'm at 3/9 HP so I need to be careful. Seer acts first this round (spd3 vs my spd1), so I should position to deal damage after their move. Attack Seer directly since they're in range and wounded. Move to (3,1) to stay close and maintain pressure, then attack Seer at (3,2).

### Turn 14 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper at (3,1) which blocks my scan ability. Priority: escape the denial zone first. Moving north to (3,3) gets me away from Viper and avoids trap at (2,3). From (3,3) I can then scan Viper — wait, Viper is already scanned. I should move away to re-enable abilities and avoid Viper's attack next turn. Move to (3,3) to escape denial zone, then wait or scan if any other target exists. No other enemies visible to scan. Move away, then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded at (3,3), distance 2 - within attack range. I'm at (3,1) moving west. I can attack Seer directly from current position since dist=2 and my range is 2. But wait, attack range is adjacent only (range:adjacent only). So I need to close to adjacent (dist=1). Valid moves include (3,2) which would put me adjacent to Seer at (3,3). Move to (3,2) then attack Seer to finish them off.
