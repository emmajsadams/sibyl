I can move first to escape, then recalibrate isn't possible. Best play: move to (0,5) to escape Hawk's precision_shot range (dist would be ~4 tiles from (1,4) to (0,5) = still in range at 4). Move to (1,5) puts me dist 3 from enemy Hawk. Actually I need to check - enemy Hawk has precision_shot range likely 3-4. I should move as far as possible. (0,5) is distance ~4 from (1,4). Let me move to (1,5) first which is valid, then I have no useful ability since I can't scan (enemy Vector Lattice is not adjacent but scan would be wasted at 1HP - survival first). Move to (0,5) to maximize distance from enemy Hawk at (1,4) - dist = sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 no wait (0,5) to (1,4) = |1|+|1|=2 tiles. That's still close. Best escape: (1,5) then maybe scan enemy Prophet who is wounded to finish? No, scan only does 1dmg and I'm at 1HP. I need to just flee. Move to (1,5) - dist from enemy Hawk (1,4) is 1, too close. Move to (0,5) - dist from enemy Hawk is 2. Hmm. All escape routes keep me in range.
