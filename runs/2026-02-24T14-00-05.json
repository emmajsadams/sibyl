Shadow_strike is still an attack though — it keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. I can't shadow_strike without cloak benefit anyway. My best option: move toward Snare's behind tile to set up for next turn, staying out of Vector denial range. Actually (0,4) is adjacent to Snare at (0,3) — Vector blocks abilities when adjacent.
