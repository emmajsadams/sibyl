Moving to (3,5) keeps me away from Marksman's likely shot trajectory. Marksman is the priority target per orders. From (3,5), dist to Marksman (5,3) = sqrt(4+4)≈2.83 which is ≤3 tiles but precision_shot only has range≤2 tiles. Need to check: precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Marksman at (5,3) from (3,5) = dist 2.83 — OUT of range. From (5,4), dist to Marksman (5,3) = 1 — in range but adjacent to enemy means precision_shot blocked if Vector adjacent (no Vector here). From (5,4) I can precision_shot Marksman. But moving to (5,4) keeps me near Marksman's position. Orders say maintain distance but also eliminate Marksman. Move to (5,4) to get adjacent range on Marksman — but that's very close. Actually at (5,4) dist to Marksman=1, that's adjacent, precision_shot needs LoS but not adjacency-blocked (only blocked by adjacent Vector). So move to (5,4), fire precision_shot on Marksman for 2dmg (but I moved, so 1dmg). Alternatively stay and fire: currently at (4,5), Marksman at (5,3) dist=sqrt(1+4)=2.24 which is >2 tiles. Out of range. Move to (5,4): dist to Marksman=1, fire precision_shot for 1dmg (moved penalty). Move to (4,4): dist to Marksman=sqrt(1+1)=1.41≤2, fire precision_shot for 1dmg (moved). Move to (4,3): dist to Marksman=1≤2, fire precision_shot for 1dmg (moved). Best option: move to (4,4) — repositions away from (4,5) to dodge Marksman's shot, stays within precision_shot range of Marksman (dist≈1.41≤2), and I can fire for 1dmg.

Valid moves include (4,5) which puts me at distance 2 from Marksman (5,3) — still in range but I've moved so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2. More importantly, priority target is Patch (medic) healing Bulwark, but Patch is at dist 3 from current pos and would still be dist 3+ from (4,5). Marksman is the immediate threat targeting our oracle. From (4,5): Marksman at (5,3) is dist sqrt(1+4)=~2.2 — out of range 2? No, range is tile distance (Chebyshev or Manhattan). Dist to Marksman from (4,5): |5-4|+|3-5|=1+2=3 — out of range. From (5,4): Marksman at (5,3) dist=1, Bulwark at (3,3) dist=3 out of range, Patch at (3,2) dist=4 out. From (5,5): Marksman dist=|5-5|+|3-5|=2 in range, but I've moved so precision_shot deals 1dmg. Best plan: move to (4,5) to dodge Marksman's precision_shot (they'd need to re-target), then use precision_shot on Marksman from (4,5). Marksman at (5,3) from (4,5): Manhattan dist=|5-4|+|3-5|=1+2=3 — out of range 2. So I can't hit Marksman from (4,5). Move to (5,4): Marksman at (5,3) dist=1 — adjacent, so precision_shot blocked if Marksman is Vector? No, Marksman is striker. But precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and dist=1 is adjacent — check if precision_shot works at adjacent range. It says range ≤2 tiles, adjacent is 1 tile, should work. But I moved, so 1dmg. From (5,4) I can hit Marksman at dist=1. Let me move to (5,5) instead to not be adjacent: Marksman at (5,3) dist=2, exactly in range, moved so 1dmg. Or move to (4,5) and use suppressing_fire on Marksman — suppressing_fire range ≤2 tiles. From (4,5) to Marksman (5,3): dist=3, out of range. Best: move to (5,4), precision_shot Marksman for 1dmg (moved penalty). This damages Marksman and I've repositioned away from (4,4).",
