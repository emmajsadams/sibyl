## Squads
### Player
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Patch** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,4) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1: activate cloak for stealth advantage, then move toward enemy backline to prepare for breach/shadow_strike next turn
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1: activating cloak as instructed. No enemies in range. Will cloak first, then advance north to close distance while invisible.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,4) ✗ Position occupied → wait ✓
  💭 All allies at full HP. Wraith is our damage dealer at (2,2). Move closer to stay adjacent to threatened ally (Wraith likely to engage soon). Position at (2,4) to be 2 tiles from Wraith.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies at full HP. Move forward to support position and stay within movement range of allies.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies out of scan range (dist 5 > 4). Move south toward (1,3) to close distance to 3 tiles from Lens, enabling scan next turn. Stay behind allies.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,1) ✓ → scan(1,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Lens oracle at (1,3) is in scan range (dist=3). Scanning now to reveal their prompt gives our team intel. Will move north first to (1,1) to maintain distance while staying in scan range.
  State: Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Patch 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent and facing N. Move to (3,1) behind Patch, then breach to take control.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → breach(1,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Lens is at (1,3) facing S. I'm at (2,4) already behind them. Move to (1,4) to get adjacent behind, then breach to take control.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Enemy Lens is at (1,3), currently 3 tiles away. Orders are to focus fire on enemy Lens at (1,1) but that position is incorrect - enemy Lens is at (1,3). Moving to (2,2) gets me within attack range (adjacent) of Lens at (1,3). Then attack Lens to follow focus fire orders.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,2) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith at (3,1) is in scan range and healthy. Foresight shows it cloaked and moved to (2,4) last turn. Scanning it now reveals its prompt and helps track it after future cloaks. Move north to (1,2) to maintain safe distance from enemy Wraith while staying in range of both enemy Wraith and Lens.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(1,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move to (2,3) and use mind_spike on enemy Wraith at (3,1), but mind_spike doesn't exist for Oracle. Only scan, recalibrate, attack available. Enemy Wraith is at (1,4) not (3,1). Ally Wraith is at (3,1). Orders appear corrupted. Will move to (2,3) as ordered and scan enemy Wraith at (1,4) to reveal their prompt.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies at full HP. Moving to (2,4) to stay adjacent to Lens and closer to Wraith. Will overclock Wraith next turn when adjacent.
  State: Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Patch 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Enemy Lens is directly behind me at (2,3) and reachable. I can move to (1,3) to get behind Lens and use breach to convert them. This is a high-value target to flip.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Patch is at (2,2) facing W. I'm at (3,1) facing S. Position (3,2) is directly behind Patch and adjacent. Move to (3,2), then breach Patch to turn them against their team.
- **Patch** (medic): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say focus fire enemy Lens at (1,1), but recon shows enemy Lens at (2,3). Enemy Lens is adjacent and in melee range. Both allies are full HP so no healing needed. Attack enemy Lens.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is the only enemy not yet scanned and is in range (dist=3). Scanning the enemy medic reveals their healing priorities and positioning strategy. This intel helps our team focus fire and predict enemy movements. I'll scan Lifeline first, then move to (0,2) to maintain range and avoid the enemy Wraith at (3,2).
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(0,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say mind_spike on enemy Wraith at (3,1), but that ability doesn't exist for Oracle. Available abilities: scan, recalibrate, attack. Enemy Wraith is at (1,3) not (3,1). Lens at (0,2) is unscanned and in range. Should scan Lens to reveal their prompt, then move closer to support team.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✓
  💭 Lens is wounded at (3,3) with 7/8 HP and needs healing. Move to (3,4) to get adjacent, then use patch to heal.
  State: Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Patch 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Lens at (3,3) facing E — I'm at (1,3) which is directly behind them. Move to (2,3) to get adjacent and behind, then breach to turn them against their own team.
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Patch (facing W at (2,2)) and adjacent. Perfect breach opportunity - taking control of their medic will swing the battle. Breach first, then stay in position.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Orders: move to (1,3) and attack Wraith at (3,2). After moving to (1,3), Wraith will be at distance 2 (not adjacent), so attack is out of range. Following orders as given.
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 All enemies scanned. Wraith breaches on cooldown. My ally Wraith is at (2,3), enemy Wraith at (3,2). Recalibrate my Wraith to focus the enemy oracle who is supporting their team.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(1,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith at (2,3) is adjacent and the primary threat. I should scan Patch at (1,3) to reveal their prompt (dist=2, within scan range), then move away from the enemy Wraith to avoid their melee range while maintaining position to support team.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP. Moving closer to support range. Enemy Wraith at (2,3) is closest threat. Will move to (2,4) to stay near allies and prepare to support.
  State: Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Patch 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Lens 8/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Lens at (1,2) facing E - I can reach behind at (0,2) in 1 move and shadow_strike while maintaining cloak. This is optimal: damage + stay hidden.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 Priority target is enemy oracle Lens at (4,3). Recon shows I can reach (3,3) which is behind Lens (facing E) and adjacent. Move there, then shadow_strike to deal 2dmg while keeping cloak intact.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (0,2) blocking my scan ability. I need to reposition to maintain range and continue providing intel. Moving to (2,2) puts distance between me and the Wraith while keeping allies in recalibrate range. Then scan the enemy Lifeline to complete intel gathering on all enemies.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → patch(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Lens(oracle,E) is wounded at 6/8 HP and needs healing. Move adjacent to Lens at (3,3), then use patch to heal them.
- **Patch** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move to (1,3) and attack Wraith. Already at (1,3). Wraith is at (0,2), dist=2, not adjacent. Cannot attack. Lens(oracle,A) is wounded at (2,2), dist=2. Should move adjacent to heal next turn, but orders conflict. Following orders: stay put, cannot execute attack.
- **Lens** (oracle): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (3,3) and is the primary threat per orders. I should attack it first to deal damage, then move away to range 2-3 to avoid being adjacent to their Vector (which would block my scan). Moving to (5,3) puts me at range 2 from Wraith for future scans.
  State: Wraith 4/5, Lens 6/8, Patch 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Lens 6/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 Breach unavailable (2/2 used). Two enemies at dist=2: Lens(2,2) and Patch(1,3). Position (1,2) is behind BOTH enemies and reachable. Move there, then shadow_strike Lens to deal damage while keeping cloak.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy oracle Lens at (5,3) is priority target. I'm at (3,3) facing E, cloaked. Recon shows (4,3) is behind Lens and adjacent. Move to (4,3), then shadow_strike to deal 2dmg while keeping cloak.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → recalibrate(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm wounded (4/8 HP) and adjacent to enemy Wraith. Enemy Lens tried to attack me last turn. I should retreat to safety and support from range. Moving to (3,3) gets me away from danger and adjacent to my Wraith for potential recalibrate support.
- **Patch** (medic): attack(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders: move to (1,3) and attack Wraith at (1,2). Already at (1,3), enemy Wraith adjacent at (1,2). Execute attack.
- **Lens** (oracle): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (4,3) and is the primary threat per orders. I can attack it directly (1 damage, adjacent range). Then move to (5,4) to maintain distance from threats while staying in range of allies.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,3) ✗ Position occupied → patch(1,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Wraith ally at (1,2) is wounded (4/5 HP) and closest. Move to (1,3) to be adjacent, then patch to heal 2HP.
  State: Wraith 3/5, Lens 4/8, Patch 6/6, Wraith 4/5, Lens 4/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Enemy oracle Lens at (5,4) is wounded and I'm already behind them. Move to (5,3) to get adjacent, then use shadow_strike to finish them off while maintaining cloak.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Patch (facing N, I'm at their south). Shadow_strike to damage without breaking cloak would be ideal, but I'm adjacent so I can only use shadow_strike or attack. Since breach is exhausted (2/2), I'll shadow_strike Patch for 2 damage while keeping cloak, then move to (3,2) which is behind enemy Lens for next turn positioning.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Lens is critically wounded at 2/8 HP and most threatened. Move adjacent to Lens at (3,3) by going to (3,4), then patch to heal them 2HP.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Enemy Wraith adjacent at (3,2) blocking my scan ability. Enemy Lifeline at (3,4) is keeping their team healthy. I need to move away from the adjacent Wraith to restore scan functionality, then attack the critical enemy Lens at (5,4) to finish them off.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Enemy Wraith is adjacent at (5,3) and wounded. I'm also wounded at 2/8 HP. Enemy oracle Lens at (4,3) just attacked me last turn. I should move away to safety since I'm dangerously low on HP and getting adjacent to enemies violates my orders. Moving to (5,5) puts distance between me and threats. Then attack the wounded Wraith at (5,3) since it's still in range (distance 2, within my range 4).
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens is critically wounded at 4/8 HP and my ally Wraith needs healing at 3/5 HP. Both are out of range. I need to move closer to heal them. Moving east toward (3,3) gets me closer to both wounded allies while staying behind the front line.
  State: Wraith 3/5, Lens 4/8, Patch 4/6, Wraith 4/5, Lens 2/8, Lifeline 6/6

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(3,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent and vulnerable. Enemy Lens at (4,3) is wounded and I'm behind them but can't reach behind position. I can shadow_strike Patch (keeps cloak if still active) or move behind Patch to (2,3) then shadow_strike. Since I'm facing E and Patch is N of me, I'll shadow_strike Patch directly (adjacent, 2dmg to healthy target), then move to (2,3) to get behind them for next turn positioning.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 Enemy oracle Lens at (5,5) is critical HP and I'm positioned behind them. Move to (5,4) to get adjacent, then shadow_strike to finish them while maintaining cloak.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → recalibrate(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Enemy Wraith at (2,3) is isolated and dangerous. Our wounded Wraith ally at (5,4) needs support. Move to (5,3) to be adjacent to wounded ally, then use recalibrate to give them tactical guidance to focus fire or retreat.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Two enemies adjacent (Wraith at 2,3 and Lifeline at 3,4) block healing. Wraith ally at 5,4 is critically wounded (3/5 HP). Must escape to heal. Move E to (4,3), then move E again to (5,3) to be adjacent to wounded Wraith.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Ally Wraith at (2,3) is wounded (4/5 HP). Orders: stay adjacent to most threatened ally and heal most wounded. Move to (2,4) to be adjacent to wounded Wraith, then patch to heal.
  State: Wraith 3/5, Lens 4/8, Patch 2/6, Wraith 5/5, Lifeline 6/6 | Dead: Lens

### Turn 9 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is in range at (2,4). Can reach behind tile (3,4) in 1 move. Since breaches are exhausted, use shadow_strike to deal damage while maintaining cloak. Move to (3,4) behind Lifeline, then shadow_strike.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is wounded at range 2. I can move to (4,4) which is behind Wraith and adjacent, then shadow_strike to finish them while keeping cloak. This eliminates their most mobile threat.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 My ally Wraith at (3,4) is critical and was just healed by enemy Lifeline. Enemy Wraith at (4,4) is healthy and adjacent to me. I should reposition away from the enemy Wraith to avoid their shadow_strike, then use recalibrate on my critical ally Wraith to help them survive or escape. Moving to (5,4) keeps me at range.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(3,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith ally at (3,4) is critically wounded with 1HP. Must heal immediately. Move adjacent to Wraith, then patch.
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 My ally Wraith is at full HP and doesn't need healing. Enemy Wraith is adjacent and wounded - I should attack. Then move to (3,5) to stay adjacent to my ally Wraith at (4,4).
  State: Wraith 2/5, Lens 4/8, Patch 2/6, Wraith 5/5, Lifeline 4/6 | Dead: Lens

### Turn 10 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith and Lens both wounded at dist 1. Wraith adjacent and I'm behind it. Shadow_strike for 2dmg kill, maintain cloak. Then shadow_strike Lens for 2dmg kill.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → overclock(4,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at full HP (5/5) so no healing needed. Move adjacent to Wraith at (4,4) to stay close to most threatened ally. Overclock Wraith to boost damage output since all allies healthy.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → patch(5,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is wounded at 2/8 HP and needs healing. Move adjacent to Lens at (5,4), then use patch to heal them.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,3) ✗ Position occupied → recalibrate(5,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent and threatening. I'm low HP (4/8) and vulnerable. Move south to (5,3) to stay with Patch and create distance from Wraith. Then recalibrate Patch who is wounded - give tactical addendum to help them survive.
  State: Lens 4/8, Patch 2/6, Wraith 4/5, Lifeline 4/6 | Dead: Wraith, Lens

### Turn 11 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Overclocked with 2 abilities. Lens wounded at range 1 (adjacent). Patch wounded at range 2, currently behind them at (4,3). Move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Patch, then shadow_strike Lens twice to finish them while keeping cloak.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → recalibrate(5,4) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Wraith just hit me twice with shadow_strike. I'm at 4/8 HP. Lifeline is healing/supporting Wraith. I should move away from Wraith to safety and use recalibrate on Patch to help coordinate against the cloaked Wraith threat.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(5,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent and I'm at 2/6 HP. Enemy medic Lifeline is at distance 3. Lens is wounded (4/8 HP) but not adjacent (distance 2). I have 1 heal remaining. Priority is survive - I need to heal myself since I'm critically wounded and threatened by adjacent Wraith. Then move toward Lens for mutual protection.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(4,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is wounded (4/5 HP) at distance 2. Move to (4,4) to become adjacent, then patch Wraith.
  State: Lens 4/8, Patch 4/6, Wraith 5/5, Lifeline 4/6 | Dead: Wraith, Lens

### Turn 12 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent at (5,4) and I'm already behind them. Shadow_strike deals 2dmg while keeping cloak. Lens is wounded at (5,5). Move to (5,3) to get adjacent to both, shadow_strike Patch, then shadow_strike Lens next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(5,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Patch depleted (0/3). Lens at 4/8 HP needs healing but I can't patch. Enemy Wraith adjacent at (5,3) — threat. Overclock Lens to give oracle 2 abilities for potential double-scan value. Then move away from Wraith to (4,5) for safety.
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(4,5) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✗ No unit at target
  💭 Overclocked with 2 abilities. Wraith at (5,3) is 2 tiles away, within scan range. Lifeline at (4,4) is also in range. Both enemies already scanned. Patch is wounded at (4,5). Should recalibrate Patch to help them survive/contribute better, then attack Wraith to pressure the specter.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → overclock(5,3) ✓
  💭 Patch depleted (0/3). Wraith full HP at (5,3). Enemy Patch adjacent at (4,5). Move to (5,4) to stay adjacent to Wraith, then overclock Wraith for 2 abilities next turn.
  State: Lens 3/8, Patch 2/6, Wraith 4/5, Lifeline 4/6 | Dead: Wraith, Lens

### Turn 13 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,5) ✓
  💭 Overclocked with 2 abilities. Move behind Patch at (4,4), then shadow_strike twice to finish wounded targets. Lens is also behind-able from (5,4) but Patch is closer and confirmed reachable.
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(5,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Wraith is wounded (4/5 HP) and adjacent. Patch is exhausted (0/3). Lens is adjacent, blocking overclock. Must attack Lens to enable future support or move to stay adjacent to Wraith.
- **Lens** (oracle): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP and adjacent to Lifeline. Wraith is cloaked at (4,4). I should attack the adjacent Lifeline to contribute damage, then move away to safety at range.
  State: Lens 2/8, Wraith 4/5, Lifeline 3/6 | Dead: Wraith, Patch, Lens
