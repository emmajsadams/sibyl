I need to move away first to avoid being adjacent, then use precision_shot. Valid moves: (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,4). From (5,4), Rampart at (5,3) is dist=1 still adjacent. From (3,2): Rampart(5,3) dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, Phantom(4,2) dist=1 still adjacent. From (4,3): Rampart(5,3) dist=sqrt(1+0)=1, still adjacent.
