Since I move first then use ability, moving to (3,5) puts me behind+adjacent to Weaver — but denial is based on adjacency to Weaver, and (3,5) is still adjacent to Weaver at (3,4). However, breach is what gets blocked by Vector denial — shadow_strike is a basic melee strike that might still work. The warning says 'only basic attack/movement work' in denial zone.
