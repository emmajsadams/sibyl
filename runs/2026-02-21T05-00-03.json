Alternatively suppressing_fire on Bastion to slow it. Actually suppressing_fire does 1dmg in a 2-tile line — targeting Bastion at (3,2) from (1,2) would fire east hitting (3,2) and (4,2) which has a trap. That's risky.

From (3,2): dist to (4,2)=1 (adjacent, blocks precision_shot). From (2,2): trap. No good firing position reachable this turn.
