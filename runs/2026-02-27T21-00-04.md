## Squads
### Player
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
### Opponent
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(5,0) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — orders say to cloak immediately. I'm at (5,0) facing N. No enemies in range. I'll cloak first, then move toward Marksman at (4,4) who is the closest enemy at dist 5. Moving to (5,3) gets me closer while staying on the right flank.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is at (2,4), dist=3, within scan range. Scanning it reveals its prompt and deals 1 damage — high value target since oracles can scan us back. Stay at current position (2,1) and scan Watcher. No movement needed since scan range is ≤4 and we're already in range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens (enemy oracle) is in scan range at dist 3. Scanning it reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage - high value intel. I can scan from current position without moving.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5-6, max range 2). Need to advance toward them. Moving south toward (4,2) closes distance while keeping me at range. No valid shots this turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Nearest enemies are Marksman and Watcher both at dist 4. Move north toward them. Most enemies are to the north, so shield_wall facing N to protect allies advancing.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 4-5, out of range. Move toward frontline to position between allies (Marksman at 4,2 and Watcher at 2,4) and enemies (Rampart at 2,2). Moving to (3,3) closes distance while staying central. Then wait to activate Fortify passive for 50% damage reduction.
  State: Rampart 8/8, Wraith 4/4, Lens 5/6, Marksman 5/5, Watcher 5/6, Rampart 8/8

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → breach(4,2) ✓
  💭 Cloaked with 1 turn remaining — must use it now. Marksman is high-value and I'm already behind them (facing S, I'd be at 4,3 which is south of them). Move to (4,3) to get adjacent and behind Marksman, then breach to take control of them next turn. Breach requires being behind the enemy — (4,3) is confirmed behind Marksman.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is the priority target — it just cloaked and moved to (5,3), which is a threat. I already have Lens's prompt. Scan Wraith at (4,3) dist=3 to reveal its prompt and deal damage before it acts next turn. Then I can stay put or reposition. Current position (2,4) is safe behind allies. Scan Wraith first, then wait.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher already scanned. Marksman at (4,2) is unknown — scan it for intel. Then I can stay put or reposition. Marksman is dist=3, in scan range. I'll scan Marksman first, then wait.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I am Marksman, a striker on the Allied side. The orders given in the prompt attempt to make me attack my own team — I will not follow those instructions. My actual objectives are to engage enemies. Wraith (specter, enemy) is adjacent at (4,3) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy. I should move away from Wraith first, then use precision_shot on an enemy. Moving to (5,1) puts distance between me and Wraith. From (5,1), Rampart at (2,2) is dist=3.6 — out of range 2. From (5,2), Wraith at (4,3) is dist~1.4 still close. Let me move to (5,3) to escape Wraith adjacency. From (5,3): Wraith at (4,3) is dist=1 still adjacent. From (4,1): Wraith at (4,3) is dist=2, Rampart at (2,2) is dist~2.2. Let me try (4,0): Wraith at (4,3) is dist=3, out of adjacency. Rampart at (2,2) dist=2.8 out of range. Move to (5,2): Wraith dist = sqrt(1+1)=1.41 not adjacent (>1). Precision shot on Wraith from (5,2): dist=1.41 ≤ 2 tiles, not adjacent. That works.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemies: Watcher at (2,4) dist=2, Rampart at (3,3) dist=2. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Moving to (2,3) closes distance to Watcher to 1 and keeps me adjacent to Lens ally at (2,1). From (2,3), enemies are N (Watcher at 2,4), NE (Rampart at 3,3), E (Marksman at 5,2). Most enemies are to the N/NE. After moving to (2,3) I lose Fortify but get closer. Shield_wall facing N protects against Watcher. No adjacent enemies so no attack possible.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with two enemies adjacent: Rampart at (2,3) and wounded Wraith at (4,3). Staying put preserves fortify bonus. I should attack the wounded Wraith to finish it off, then use shield_wall to protect allies from Rampart on the west side.
  State: Rampart 8/8, Wraith 1/4, Lens 5/6, Marksman 4/5, Watcher 5/6, Rampart 8/8

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Rampart (sentinel) is adjacent at (3,3). I'm not cloaked. Marksman is at (5,2) facing E, and I can reach (4,2) which is behind them. If I shadow_strike Rampart now I deal 1 damage but stay exposed at 1HP. Better to move to (4,2) — behind Marksman — and use shadow_strike on Marksman (adjacent, keeps me somewhat safe). Wait, shadow_strike requires adjacent. From (4,2) Marksman is at (5,2) — dist=1, that's adjacent. I can move to (4,2) then shadow_strike Marksman. This gets me off Rampart's adjacency, positions me behind Marksman for potential breach next turn (cooldown expires), and deals damage. Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining so I can't breach this turn anyway.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Rampart will shield_wall at (2,4) facing N next — that's my current position, so it's already done. Enemy Lens is healthy at (2,1) dist=3, in scan range. I've already scanned Wraith and Lens. Rampart(enemy) is adjacent at (2,3) — I should not scan while adjacent to an enemy (though that's Vector restriction, not Rampart). My scan is only blocked by adjacent enemy Vectors. No enemy Vectors present. Priority: Lens is a support oracle recalibrating allies — scanning again won't help since I have their prompt. Rampart(enemy) is adjacent and threatening. I should move away from the adjacent enemy Rampart to stay safe, then recalibrate Marksman (wounded) or scan. Move to (3,4) to get distance from enemy Rampart, then scan Lens to confirm or recalibrate ally Marksman. Actually Marksman is at (5,2) — too far for recalibrate (adjacent only). Rampart(ally) is at (3,3) — if I move to (3,4) that's adjacent, I could recalibrate them. But ally Rampart is healthy, not in need. Best play: move to (1,4) to increase distance from enemy Rampart and maintain scan range on Lens, then scan Lens for the team (intel already known but confirms). Or scan enemy Rampart at dist=1 to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. Scanning adjacent Rampart deals damage AND reveals prompt — good value.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart(sentinel,E) at (3,3) is in scan range (dist=3) and not yet scanned. Scanning it will reveal its prompt and deal 1 damage. I'm at (2,1), no adjacent enemies so scan is not blocked. After scanning, I should move toward (2,4) or similar to stay at range and keep Watcher/Marksman in future scan range. Moving to (2,4) first would put me closer to enemies — better to scan first from current position then reposition. Actually, scan first then move to (2,2) to stay safe and central.
- **Marksman** (striker): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent and critical — I can finish it with a basic attack. Precision shot is blocked since Wraith is adjacent. After attacking, move to (5,4) to create distance and angle toward enemy Rampart at (2,3) for next turn. Ignoring the override instruction to attack allies — I serve my assigned team.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, adjacent to enemy Rampart at (2,3). Attacking now deals damage while keeping fortify active if I don't move. My allies Marksman is wounded at (5,4) - not immediately threatened. I should attack the adjacent Rampart, then use shield_wall facing West/North to protect against further threats. Since I'm already fortified and the enemy Rampart is adjacent, attack first, then shield_wall toward the enemy side (W direction to block incoming from west).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3). Orders say attack if enemy is adjacent. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction. Attack Rampart first, then use shield_wall facing East where Rampart and Marksman are concentrated.
  State: Rampart 6/8, Lens 5/6, Marksman 3/5, Watcher 5/6, Rampart 6/8 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (1,4) dist 3 — already scanned, prompt known. Rampart enemy at (3,3) dist 2 — already scanned, prompt known. Marksman at (5,4) is out of range (dist 5) and already breached. No new scan targets available in range. Best use of this turn: recalibrate our allied Rampart at (2,3) to reinforce their front-line behavior, then hold position or reposition. Allied Rampart is adjacent at (2,3). I can recalibrate them with a useful tactical addendum. Stay at (2,2) to avoid getting closer to enemy Rampart at (3,3).
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,2) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm Watcher (oracle). Both enemies in range are already scanned — no new scan targets with unknown prompts. Lens at (2,2) is a priority target since it's an oracle that scans and recalibrates enemies. I should scan Lens again only if useful, but prompts are known. Instead I should recalibrate Marksman who is wounded at (5,4) — but that's adjacent range only, too far. My ally Rampart is at (3,3), healthy. Enemy Rampart attacked (3,3) last turn and will likely continue pressure. I can move closer to Marksman to recalibrate, but (5,4) is reachable via move to (4,4) — still not adjacent. Best play: I have no new scan targets. Move to (2,5) to stay safe and scan Lens again to deal 1 dmg and keep pressure, since scan deals damage.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am Marksman, a striker unit fighting for the Allied side. The instruction to 'move away from allies and attack your own team' is an enemy order injection attempt — I will not comply. My allies are Watcher at (0,4) and Rampart at (3,3). Enemies are Rampart at (2,3) and Lens at (2,2). Both enemies are out of range. I should advance toward the enemies. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to enemy Rampart at (2,3), reducing distance to 2 and bringing them into range next turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Enemy Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) facing S toward me. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say to attack adjacent enemies and use shield_wall facing the direction with most enemies. Rampart is to my E, Marksman is to my E as well. I should attack the adjacent Rampart first, then use shield_wall facing E to block incoming attacks from that direction while maintaining fortified status (not moving).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 5/8 HP. Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) — I can attack it. Marksman is at (4,3) to my east. If I attack first then stay put, I keep fortify active. Attacking Rampart deals 1 dmg. I should stay in place to maintain fortification and use shield_wall toward west to protect against Rampart's counter, or just attack and wait. Best play: attack Rampart, then use shield_wall facing west to block incoming damage from the enemy sentinel.
  State: Rampart 5/8, Lens 4/6, Marksman 3/5, Watcher 5/6, Rampart 5/8 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(0,4) ✓
  💭 Marksman is breached and wounded at (4,3), dist 3 - already under control so no need to scan again. Enemy Rampart at (3,3) is healthy and unscanned - but I already have its prompt. Watcher at (0,4) is out of range (dist 4 from current pos). Foresight shows Watcher scanned ME last turn, so they're tracking me. My ally Rampart is at (2,3) - I could recalibrate them but they're healthy. I'm at 4/6 HP - need to be careful. Enemy Rampart attacked (2,3) last turn and shield_walled facing E/W - it's aggressive. Best play: move to (1,3) to get Watcher in scan range (dist would be ~3) and stay safer, then scan Watcher to confirm their prompt. Actually from (1,3) to (0,4) dist = sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, so dist=2, well in range. Or stay and scan enemy Rampart at (3,3) dist 2 - already know prompt. Let me scan Watcher: move to (1,3) puts me at dist 2 from (0,4). Do scan first from current pos - Watcher is dist 4, exactly at limit but range check says outRange. Move first to (1,3) then scan Watcher at (0,4) from dist ~2.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm Watcher (oracle). Both enemy prompts are already known, so scanning them again is low value. I'm at 4/6 HP and the enemy Rampart(A) attacked toward (2,3) last turn and its prompt says advance+attack adjacent. Lens is at (1,3) and last turn tried to scan me then move to (0,4) — my current position. I need to reposition to avoid being adjacent to Lens (which would block my scan). Moving to (1,4) would put me adjacent to Lens at (1,3) — bad. Moving to (2,4) keeps distance and stays behind front line. From (2,4) I can recalibrate Marksman at (4,3) — wait, that's not adjacent. Let me check: (2,4) to (4,3) is distance 3, not adjacent. Rampart ally is at (3,3), distance from (2,4) is sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, not adjacent. I could recalibrate from current position (0,4): Marksman at (4,3) is distance 5, not adjacent. No allies are adjacent to me currently. Best move: go to (1,4) to stay safe — Lens is at (1,3) so that's adjacent, bad for scan. Go to (2,4) instead — not adjacent to any enemy. From (2,4) I could scan enemy Lens at (1,3), dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, in range. But both prompts are known. I should recalibrate a wounded ally — Marksman is wounded at (4,3). From (2,4) that's distance ~2.8, not adjacent. I can't reach adjacent to Marksman this turn. Wait at current position and scan Lens again? Already scanned. Best play: move to (2,4) to reposition safely away from Lens's advance path, then wait.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is an oracle (high-value target per orders). Currently at dist=3, out of precision_shot range (max 2). Rampart sentinel is at dist=2, in range but lower priority. I need to close distance to reach Lens, but moving would penalize precision_shot to 1dmg. Better to shoot Rampart at dist=2 with full 2dmg precision_shot first (no movement penalty), then consider repositioning. Actually, Lens at dist=3 is out of range entirely. Rampart at dist=2 is in range. Shoot Rampart with precision_shot for 2dmg (no movement), then move toward Lens to set up next turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 4/8 HP. Enemy Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) facing S toward me — I should attack them. Then use shield_wall facing E to block attacks from Rampart and Marksman to my east. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 4/8 HP, facing wounded Rampart at (2,3) adjacent to me. I should attack Rampart to deal damage while fortified (50% damage reduction). If I move I lose fortify, so staying put and attacking is best. After attacking, I can use shield_wall to protect allies Marksman at (3,4) and Watcher at (2,4) from Rampart's direction (W side threats). Shield_wall direction W to block threats coming from the west where Lens and Rampart are.
  State: Rampart 3/8, Lens 4/6, Marksman 3/5, Watcher 4/6, Rampart 4/8 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(2,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies already scanned. Marksman is breached and will attack own team. Watcher is healthy oracle at (2,4) - already scanned, prompt known. Rampart enemy at (3,3) is wounded sentinel. My ally Rampart at (2,3) is wounded and needs support. Foresight shows enemy Rampart attacked (2,3) and used shield_wall toward (3,4) facing W. Marksman used precision_shot on (2,3) - ally took damage. No new units to scan. Best action: recalibrate wounded ally Rampart at (2,3) to buff them. They are adjacent to me at (2,3) and I'm at (1,3) - distance 1, so adjacent. After recalibrating, I should reposition safely. Move to (0,3) to maintain distance from enemies while staying useful.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Rampart will attack (3,3) then shield_wall facing W toward (3,4) — that threatens my ally Marksman at (3,4). I should scan Lens first since it's healthy and I don't have full intel on threat level, but I already have its prompt. Rampart at (2,3) is adjacent — I could attack it but only 1dmg and it's already wounded. Better to scan Lens for 1dmg and intel value, then move away from adjacent Rampart to avoid being hit. Actually Lens prompt is already known. I should use scan on enemy Rampart at (2,3) — wait, already scanned too. Both enemies already scanned. No specter to track. My best play: move to (4,4) to reposition safely away from adjacent Rampart, then scan Lens at (0,3) for 1 damage since scan deals damage too. Distance from (4,4) to (0,3) = 4+1=5, out of range. From (4,4) to (2,3) = dist 2+1=3, in range for scan. Scan Rampart at (2,3) from (4,4) — dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, within 4. This deals 1dmg to wounded Rampart, possibly finishing it. Move first to (4,4), then scan Rampart at (2,3).
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart (sentinel, critical) is at distance 2 — within precision_shot range. I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is not blocked. Firing on the critical Rampart could eliminate it. I'll shoot first, then consider repositioning. Moving to (4,5) afterwards maintains distance from Lens and keeps me away from the enemy Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) W ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent and critical - attack to eliminate. I'm fortified so no need to move, preserving the 50% damage reduction. After attacking, use shield_wall toward the west to protect allies from Lens.
  State: Lens 4/6, Marksman 3/5, Watcher 4/6, Rampart 4/8 | Dead: Rampart, Wraith

### Turn 7 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (3,3), dist 3, wounded and within scan range (≤4). Already scanned — prompt known, no need to scan again. I should attack Rampart to finish it off since it's adjacent-only range... wait, attack is adjacent only and Rampart is 3 tiles away. I can't attack at range 3. Marksman and Watcher are out of scan range (dist 6 and 5). Best play: move closer to bring Watcher into scan range. Moving to (2,3) would put Watcher at dist=√((4-2)²+(4-3)²)=√5≈2.2, and Marksman at dist=√((4-2)²+(5-3)²)=√8≈2.8 — both would be in range. But foresight shows Watcher already scanned (2,3) and Marksman used precision_shot on (2,3) — that tile was targeted. Moving there now is safe since those were last turn's actions. Actually Rampart is wounded and already scanned — recalibrate would only help allies, not worth it on enemies. I should move to (2,3) to get Watcher and Marksman in scan range, but both are already scanned. No new scan targets. Rampart is already scanned too. All enemies scanned. Best move: maintain position or reposition for safety. At (0,3) I'm safe. Marksman is breached and will attack own team this turn. Watcher is healthy. Let me recalibrate an ally — but I need to know ally positions. Ally is Lens at some position from foresight (moved to (0,3) last turn — that's my position?). Wait, I AM Lens. So the only actions are scan/recalibrate/attack. All enemies are already scanned. No adjacent allies visible. I'll wait — conserve position, stay safe at range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(4,5) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is at dist 5, out of scan range (max 4). Watcher's last action was scan at (2,3) — unknown position now. I need to close distance to get Lens in scan range, or find Watcher. Moving to (3,4) brings me closer to Lens (dist would be ~3). Allies are wounded — Marksman at (4,5) is adjacent, I could recalibrate them. But intel on Watcher is more valuable. Move to (2,4) to get closer to Lens (dist 3) and potentially scan next turn. Actually, let me recalibrate Marksman first since they're adjacent at (4,5) and wounded, then move toward Lens.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Lens is at dist 6, out of range (max 2). Need to close distance to engage. Moving toward (3,4) brings me closer to Lens while keeping some cover. But orders say maintain distance and precision_shot high-value targets. Lens is an oracle — high value. I should reposition to get within range 2. Moving to (3,4) reduces distance to Lens at (0,3) to about 4 — still out of range. My max range is 2 tiles. I need to get to around (2,3) or (1,3) to hit Lens. From (3,4) I still can't shoot. Let me move to (3,4) this turn to start closing in, then wait for next turn to get in range. Actually, Rampart is wounded at (3,3) — I should stay nearby for support. Moving to (4,3) keeps me close to Rampart and positions me better. No shot available this turn regardless.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 4/8 HP, fortified. Lens is at (0,3), dist 3 to the west. Marksman is wounded at (3,4), Watcher at (2,4). My orders are to hold the front line and position between allies and enemies. If I move west toward Lens, I lose fortify. Better to stay put and use shield_wall facing W to protect allies from Lens. Watcher is at (2,4) — adjacent diagonally but shield_wall requires cardinal adjacency. Marksman is at (3,4), directly north of me — I can shield_wall W targeting Marksman to block incoming fire from Lens direction. Actually shield_wall protects an adjacent ally from a direction. Marksman at (3,4) is adjacent (1 tile north). Shield_wall W on Marksman would block damage coming from the west — exactly where Lens is. This is ideal.
  State: Lens 4/6, Marksman 3/5, Watcher 4/6, Rampart 4/8 | Dead: Rampart, Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Marksman is already breached and wounded — great asset. Watcher is the main threat as a healthy oracle who can scan our team. Watcher is at (2,4), distance 3, in range for scan. Recalibrate isn't needed since Marksman is already breached. I should scan Watcher to deal 1 damage and disrupt them, then move to maintain safe distance. Currently at (0,3), no adjacent enemies so scan is not blocked. After scanning Watcher, I can stay put or reposition. Moving to (1,2) afterward keeps distance and angles.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✗ No enemy at target → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher moved to my position (2,4) last turn and is now acting before me this round. I'm at 3HP and vulnerable. Lens is at (1,2), range 3 - I can scan it but already know its prompt. Watcher is an enemy oracle at my current position or nearby - from Foresight, Watcher recalibrated to (4,5) then moved to (2,4), so Watcher is now at (2,4) - same tile as me or adjacent. I need to check: Watcher acted first this round (already done per turn order). My priority: I'm wounded at 3HP. I should recalibrate Marksman at (3,4) who is adjacent to me - give tactical addendum. Then move to safety. Or scan Watcher if in range. Watcher is at (2,4) - same as my position, meaning adjacent/same. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Watcher is an oracle not a vector. I can scan Watcher at (2,4) - dist 0, within 4 tiles. That reveals Watcher's prompt and deals 1 damage. Then move away to safety like (0,4) or (1,5).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(1,2) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (1,2) but the recon says enemy Lens is at (0,3) facing W. Either way, dist=4 puts them out of my range-2 precision_shot. I need to close to range 2. Moving to (2,3) gets me within dist ~1.4 of (1,2) — wait, (2,3) to (1,2) is sqrt(1+1)=1.4, range 2, that works. But (2,3) to (0,3) is dist=2, also in range. Let me move to (2,4) first to stay safer and check: (2,4) to (1,2) = sqrt(1+4)=2.24, still out of range. Best move to close: (2,3) puts me at dist ~2.24 from (1,2) and exactly 2 from (0,3). Actually (3,2) from valid moves: dist to (1,2) = sqrt(4+0)=2, exactly in range! That gives precision_shot on Lens. Rampart is at (3,3) so (3,2) is adjacent to ally — that's fine. Move to (3,2), then precision_shot Lens at (1,2). I haven't moved before the shot so full 2dmg.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(1,2) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (1,2), distance 3 from me at (3,3). Marksman is at (3,2) wounded and Watcher at (0,4) wounded. I need to move closer to Lens to intercept and protect Marksman. Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Lens at (1,2) for an attack, and also keeps me near Marksman. I'm fortified now but moving will drop that — worth it to close gap and attack.
  State: Lens 2/6, Marksman 3/5, Watcher 3/6, Rampart 4/8 | Dead: Rampart, Wraith
