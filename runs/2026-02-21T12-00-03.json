Still worth it to get into position. Let me check: (2,2) to (3,3) = sqrt(1+1) ≈ 1.41, but game likely uses Chebyshev or Manhattan. If Chebyshev: max(1,1)=1, in range. If Manhattan: 2, in range.

Aegis is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded - I can attack for 1dmg. Bolt is at dist=2 and wounded. Pulse would hit Aegis (within 1 tile) for 1dmg and potentially finish them. Let me use pulse first to hit Aegis, then attack Aegis or move. Actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - that's just Aegis at dist=1. Pulse does 1dmg to Aegis. Then I can attack Aegis for another 1dmg. This could eliminate Aegis. I'm suppressed so only mv1 - staying put and using both abilities is best. Attack Aegis first (1dmg), then pulse to hit Aegis again (1dmg) - double hit on adjacent wounded Aegis.",
