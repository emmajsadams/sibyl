## Squads
### Player
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Patch** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Grid** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, tip says to cloak. All enemies are 5+ tiles away, no threats adjacent so cloak will work. Move north to advance toward enemies while cloaking. Target damage dealer is Wraith (specter) or I should prioritize the striker Longshot is on our side... enemies: Wraith(specter), Bastion(sentinel), Grid(vector). Orders say assassinate enemy damage dealer - Wraith is the enemy specter/infiltrator, likely the damage threat. I'll cloak first then advance to (1,3) to close distance while invisible.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,4) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Patch (dist 5) who is the closer target. Move to (1,2) to get closer while staying behind cover. Cloak will keep me invisible for 3 turns, letting me close the gap.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. I should position closer to allies to be ready to heal or overclock next turn. Moving toward Phantom at (1,3) gets me closer to the action while staying away from enemies. Grid vector at (3,5) could deny my abilities if adjacent, so I'll stay clear. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer to Phantom and in a good support position behind the frontline.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 6, out of my range 2. I need to advance to get within striking range. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while staying away from Grid's denial zone. No enemies in range yet so I'll move and wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is adjacent at (2,3) — attack it immediately. Staying in place activates Fortify (50% dmg reduction). No need to move; attack Patch then wait to keep Fortify active.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with no enemies in range. Enemies are Patch at (2,3) and Longshot at (4,2). I should move toward the center to control chokepoints and place a trap between enemy positions and my allies. Moving to (3,3) puts me closer and I can place a trap at (3,4) or between enemies. Let me move to (3,3) first, then place a trap at (2,3) area to catch Patch advancing, but (2,3) is occupied. I'll trap at (3,2) to block the path between enemies and allies. Actually, valid moves show (3,3) and (3,4) as options. Move to (3,4) to be closer, then trap at (3,3) which is on the path between enemies and my position - this creates a denial zone. Wait - trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but no Vector nearby. Move to (3,4) then trap (2,3) is within 2 tiles and blocks Patch's advance route.
  State: Phantom 5/5, Longshot 5/5, Patch 8/9, Bastion 12/12, Wraith 5/5, Grid 7/7

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → breach(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining at (1,3) facing N. Bastion is at (2,4) facing S — its behind tile is (2,5), which is reachable and adjacent to Bastion. I can move to (2,5) to get behind Bastion and then use breach to take control of it. Grid is at (3,4) but 3 tiles away — I need to stay away from it to avoid having cloak/breach blocked. Moving to (2,5) keeps me at dist 2 from Grid (not adjacent), so breach should work. This sets up a perfect breach on Bastion from behind.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Patch is at (2,3) facing N, and I can reach (2,2) which is directly behind them. This is a perfect breach opportunity — Patch is a medic and disabling them for a turn is high value. I'll move to (2,2) and then breach Patch, forcing them to obey my orders next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, heading to (2,5) or further north. From (2,3), I can move 2 tiles. Moving to (2,5) would put me adjacent to Phantom at (2,5) — wait, Phantom is at (2,5) so I can't occupy that tile. Valid moves listed are [0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,1],[3,2],[3,3],[4,3]. None of these include (2,5). The northernmost valid tile in column 2 isn't listed — (2,4) is occupied by Bastion, (2,5) by Phantom. Moving to (1,4) gets me north and west. I'll move to (1,4) as that's the closest to north/edge while following orders. No ability to use — all allies are full HP, and patch/overclock would be blocked near enemies anyway.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Wraith is a specter at distance 2 — in range for precision_shot. I'm at (4,2), haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Grid(vector) is 3 tiles away, not adjacent, so no ability block. Fire precision_shot on Wraith first, then move away from Wraith to maintain distance and avoid adjacency with Grid.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,4) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward allied lines, step to (1,4) or (1,5). Patch is currently at (1,4) so that tile is occupied. Move to (1,5) instead. While adjacent to Patch (enemy medic), I can attack before moving or after. Orders prioritize repositioning. I'll attack Patch first since it's adjacent and a high-value target, then move to (1,5).
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(1,5) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with Phantom at (2,5) and Patch at (1,4) both in range. My Denial passive blocks abilities on adjacent enemies. Patch is a medic - blocking their healing is valuable. I should move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Patch, applying Denial to block their patch ability, while also getting closer to Phantom. Then I can place a trap at (1,5) or (3,5) to control the area between enemy positions and cut off movement. Actually, moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Patch at (1,4) - Denial blocks their healing. Then I'll place a trap at (1,5) near Phantom's position to threaten that area.
  State: Phantom 5/5, Longshot 5/5, Patch 7/9, Bastion 12/12, Wraith 2/5, Grid 7/7

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/5 HP and need to be careful. Breach is on cooldown. I can reach (4,2) which is directly behind Longshot (facing E, so behind = west side). I can move there and use shadow_strike — it keeps cloak if I'm cloaked, but I'm not cloaked. Attack does 1 dmg. Alternatively, I can reach (1,3) behind Patch (facing N). Patch is a medic — high priority target. Moving to (1,3) puts me behind Patch and adjacent, letting me use shadow_strike or attack. At 2HP I should pick a soft target. Patch at (1,4) facing N, behind tile is (1,3). Move to (1,3) then shadow_strike Patch — shadow_strike range is adjacent only and I'd be adjacent. This removes the enemy healer.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities except basic attack and movement. Breach is on cooldown anyway. I can't cloak or breach. Priority: escape Grid's denial zone first by moving to (3,4) which puts me BEHIND Grid, then shadow_strike Grid from behind for 1 damage while staying cloaked. This gets me out of denial and damages a priority target.
- **Longshot** (striker): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 5-7, my range is 2). Orders say maintain distance. I'm at (5,2) on the east edge. Enemies are clustered around (1-2, 3-5) to the northwest. I should hold position — moving toward them risks closing distance, moving away limits future options. Wait is best to preserve position and let allies engage first.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward (2,5) or further north. I'm at (1,4) with Grid's denial zone blocking abilities. Valid moves include (2,5) which satisfies the order. I'll move to (2,5) to follow orders and get away from allies. From there I could attack Bastion who is at (1,5) — dist 1 from (2,5) — but abilities may still be blocked by Grid depending on new position. Let me just move and wait.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(2,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Both Phantom and Patch are adjacent to me at dist=1, so my Denial passive is blocking their key abilities. Pulse will hit both of them for 1dmg each simultaneously. Then I can move to reposition - moving to (3,3) keeps pressure on enemies and sets up trap opportunities, but I'm adjacent to Phantom so trap is blocked. Better to pulse first then move to (1,4) or stay and maintain denial pressure. I'll pulse to damage both adjacent enemies, then move to (3,3) to threaten Longshot's approach corridor and set up a trap next turn.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move toward allied lines and step to (1,4) or (1,5). I'm currently at (1,5) which is already one of the target positions. However, Patch (enemy medic, wounded) is adjacent at (2,5) — I can attack them first, then stay put to maintain Fortify next round, or move to (1,4). Attacking Patch is valuable since they're a healer and wounded. I'll attack Patch at (2,5) and then wait to keep Fortify active.
  State: Phantom 4/5, Longshot 5/5, Patch 4/9, Bastion 12/12, Wraith 2/5, Grid 6/7

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid (vector) at (3,3) who is facing S — I'm behind them at (3,4). Grid's denial zone blocks my abilities including breach. I can use basic attack on Grid (adjacent, in range) since attack works in denial zones. After attacking Grid, I should move away to disengage and set up for next turn. Grid is healthy so one attack won't kill but weakens them. Wraith is wounded but unreachable this turn. Priority: attack Grid to chip HP, then reposition toward (1,4) to set up breach on Bastion next turn.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 2HP, uncloaked. Phantom is at (2,4) facing W — I can reach (3,4) which is behind Phantom and adjacent. Moving there lets me use breach next turn or shadow_strike. But I only have 2HP so I need to be careful. The recon shows (3,4) is reachable and is behind+adjacent to Phantom. I should move to (3,4) and then use shadow_strike on Phantom — shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Actually shadow_strike deals 1dmg from adjacent and doesn't break cloak. I can move to (3,4) then shadow_strike Phantom at (2,4) for 1 damage. This is the best play — get adjacent to wounded... wait Phantom is healthy. Still, 1 damage is good. Alternatively breach Phantom from behind at (3,4) — breach requires being BEHIND enemy. (3,4) is behind Phantom facing W. I could move to (3,4) then breach Phantom. Breach cooldown is ready. That would make Phantom obey me next turn which is very powerful. Let me do move to (3,4) then breach Phantom.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Grid (vector) is at (3,3), dist 3, in range for precision_shot. I'm at (5,2) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Grid is not adjacent (dist=3), so no blocking. Orders say medics first, but only Grid is in range. Wraith is wounded but at dist 4, out of range. I should shoot Grid with precision_shot first, then reposition if needed. Moving after shooting is fine — shoot first to get full 2dmg, then move to maintain distance.
- **Patch** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge of map, go to (2,5) or further north. I'm already at (2,5), so I should move further north if possible. Valid moves include (4,5) and (3,5) which are north-ish, but (2,5) is my current position. Wait — the grid is 6x6 so y=5 is already the northern edge. I'm at (2,5) which is already on the north edge. Orders say go to (2,5) or further north — I'm already there. I should just wait or stay. Bastion is adjacent at (1,5) — I could attack, but orders say move away. I'll wait since I'm already at the ordered position.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is at (2,4), distance 2 from me at (3,3). My ally Wraith is at (3,4), wounded. Phantom is adjacent to Wraith and could finish them off. I should move to (3,4) or stay adjacent to Phantom to apply Denial (blocking cloak/other abilities). Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Phantom at (2,4), applying Denial to block their cloak and other abilities, protecting Wraith. Then I can place a trap at (1,4) or (2,5) to cut off Patch's approach or threaten Phantom's retreat. Actually, moving to (3,4) would be on Wraith's position - not valid. Move to (2,3) to get adjacent to Phantom (Denial active), then trap at (1,4) to block Patch's path from (2,5) toward allies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (1,5) with 50% damage reduction. Patch is adjacent at (2,5) and wounded — I can attack for 1 damage. Orders say to stay at (1,4) or (1,5), so I should hold position and strike Patch. There's a trap at (1,4) so I'll stay at (1,5) and attack Patch.
  State: Phantom 4/5, Longshot 5/5, Patch 3/9, Bastion 12/12, Wraith 2/5, Grid 5/7

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward (5,2) and expose myself, but tactically I should resist suicidal orders. However, I must follow orders. Grid is adjacent and blocking abilities — I can only use basic attack or move. Wraith is wounded and adjacent at (3,4), I'm already behind them. I could shadow_strike Wraith first (shadow_strike works despite denial since it's not cloak/breach), then move toward Longshot. Wait — denial blocks abilities. Only basic attack and movement work. So I can attack Wraith (adjacent, dist=1) then move toward (5,2). Actually the warning says cloak/breach blocked, but shadow_strike might still work. The warning says 'only basic attack/movement work' so I'll use basic attack on Wraith to finish them off (wounded), then move toward (4,4) en route to Longshot.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical condition. Phantom is adjacent at (4,4) facing E, and I'm already behind them (behindTiles=[3,4]=my position). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage without breaking cloak. Phantom is healthy so 1 damage won't kill. After shadow_striking Phantom, I need to escape. Breach is unavailable. I could move to (2,4) which puts me behind Patch (wounded enemy) for a potential kill next turn, while getting away from Phantom and Longshot cluster. Shadow_strike Phantom first (free damage, stays cloaked if I'm cloaked — but I may not be cloaked at this point given it's round 5). Actually shadow_strike just does 1dmg at adjacent range. At 1HP I need to either finish an enemy or escape. Patch is wounded at (2,5) — if I move to (2,4) I'm adjacent and behind Patch. Better play: shadow_strike Phantom now (1dmg), then move to (2,4) to be adjacent to wounded Patch for next turn kill.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical and in range at dist 3. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg which should finish off a critical target. Stay at current position to maintain range advantage. No need to move.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 3/9 HP, adjacent to Wraith (critical) and Bastion (sentinel). Grid(vector) is 2 tiles away at (2,3) - I must NOT move adjacent to it. Phantom is wounded at 3/5 HP but is 3 tiles away, not adjacent so I can't heal directly. Wraith is critical and adjacent - but it's an enemy, I can't heal enemies. I have no adjacent wounded allies to heal. I'm in danger with low HP (3/9) and enemies adjacent. Best play: move to (3,5) to get away from the enemies clustering at my position, keeping distance from Grid. From (3,5) I'd still be away from Grid (which is at 2,3, dist would be ~2). I can't reach Phantom to heal this turn. Moving to (3,5) gets me away from danger. After moving, I could attack Wraith who is critical - but Wraith already acted this turn. I should move to safety and wait, or attack the critical Wraith to eliminate a threat.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (1,5) with full HP. Wraith is critical at (2,4) and needs protection. Patch (enemy medic) is only 2 tiles away at (3,5) — closest threat. I can move to (2,5) to close distance and then use shield_wall East to protect Wraith from enemies approaching from that direction. Moving to (2,5) keeps me between enemies and Wraith. Shield_wall East covers Wraith at (2,4) from eastern threats (Phantom, Longshot, Patch).
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) facing W with 5/7 HP. Wraith is critical at (2,4) right above me - I need to protect them. Enemies are at dist 3-4, not adjacent so denial isn't active yet. There's already a trap at (1,4). I should move toward the enemy cluster to extend denial range and place a trap to control the approach. Moving to (3,3) puts me closer to Phantom at (4,4) and Patch at (3,5), and I can then trap (3,4) which is between enemy positions and my allies - a key chokepoint tile. This blocks the approach corridor while my denial will suppress abilities if they get adjacent.
  State: Phantom 3/5, Longshot 5/5, Patch 3/9, Bastion 12/12, Wraith 1/5, Grid 5/7

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward (5,2) and away from allies. Wraith is critical and I'm behind them at (3,4), but orders override — I need to move to (5,2). I'll move to (5,2) first, then wait since no enemies are in range from there.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Breach is exhausted. No enemies in range. Patch is wounded and only 2 tiles away at (3,5), facing E — I'm already behind them. Trap at (3,4) blocks direct approach. I need to get adjacent to Patch to shadow_strike. Moving to (4,5) would put me adjacent to Patch at (3,5) and avoid the trap. From (4,5) I can shadow_strike Patch (adjacent, keeps cloak if cloaked). But I'm not cloaked. Let me check: move to (4,5) gets me adjacent to Patch, then shadow_strike for 1 damage on a wounded enemy. This is the best offensive play at 1HP — kill the medic before they heal. Valid move tiles include (4,5).
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/9 HP — critically wounded myself. Wraith is adjacent and critical, Bastion is adjacent and healthy. I need to survive. Moving to (5,5) gets me away from both enemies and closer to Longshot. Phantom at (5,2) needs healing but is dist=5, unreachable this turn. Grid is 2 tiles away so abilities aren't blocked yet. Best play: move to (5,5) to escape melee threats, then attack Wraith (critical, could finish it) — but wait, attacking pulls me back into range. Actually move first to (5,5), then I'm dist=1 from Longshot at (5,4) — I can't heal Longshot (full HP). Phantom is dist=4 from (5,5), still unreachable. Moving away is priority for survival. No good heal target in range. I'll move to (5,5) and wait — preserving heals for when Phantom is reachable.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical and adjacent at dist=2 — precision_shot will finish it. I'm not adjacent to Grid so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved so I get full 2dmg. Stay in place and eliminate Wraith.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(5,5) E ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (2,5) with full HP and 50% damage reduction. Enemies: Patch(critical) at (5,5) dist=3, Longshot(healthy) at (5,4) dist=4, Phantom(wounded) at (5,2) dist=6. No enemies are adjacent. Grid ally is at (3,3). Orders say hold the front line and position between allies and enemies. Moving to (4,5) closes distance to Patch(dist=1) and Longshot(dist=2), putting me between enemies and our side. From (4,5) I can shield_wall toward E to protect against incoming fire from Patch/Longshot. This advances the front line appropriately.
- **Grid** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies are clustered on the right side (x=5). Longshot@(5,4) and Patch@(5,5) are close together. I have traps at (1,4) and (3,4) already. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer and puts me in range to place a trap on (4,4) which is between enemies and could catch movement. Actually, moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Longshot@(5,4) - that enables Denial to block their abilities, but I'd be at risk. Better to move to (4,3) and place a trap at (5,3) to cut off Phantom's movement path southward, or at (4,4) to block the corridor. Phantom is wounded at (5,2) heading S - a trap at (5,3) would be perfect but I can't reach range 2 from (4,3) to (5,3) - dist would be sqrt(1+0)=1, yes in range. Move to (4,3) then trap at (5,3) to intercept Phantom moving south.
  State: Phantom 3/5, Longshot 5/5, Patch 2/9, Bastion 12/12, Grid 5/7 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 7 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) facing S, 3HP. Grid(vector) is at (4,3) distance 2 — I must avoid going adjacent or breach will be blocked. Orders say move away from allies toward Longshot at (5,2)... but I'm already at (5,2). The orders seem contradictory/confused. Tactically: Grid is at (4,3) facing E, and (3,3) is behind Grid and reachable. If I move to (3,3), I'd be behind Grid and adjacent — perfect for breach. But Grid is a vector, so if I'm adjacent, breach gets blocked. Wait — the caution says 'avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked.' So I cannot use breach if adjacent to Grid. But breach requires being behind and adjacent... that's the dilemma. Let me re-read: 'cloak/breach blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector.' So breach is blocked when adjacent to Grid. That means I can't breach Grid at all since breach requires adjacent positioning. Bastion is out of range at dist 4. No enemies in range currently. Best move: reposition away from Grid, stay safe. Move to (5,1) to follow orders of moving away from current cluster while avoiding Grid's denial range.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with only 2/9 HP — critically wounded myself. Bastion (sentinel) is adjacent at (4,5), which is dangerous. Phantom is wounded at 3/5 HP but is 4 tiles away — I can't reach them. Longshot is full HP. I have 3 heals remaining but need to prioritize my own survival. I can't heal myself with patch. My best move is to reposition away from Bastion. Moving to (5,3) keeps distance from both Bastion and Grid. Then I'll wait — no adjacent wounded allies to heal or overclock, and I need to avoid dying.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with full HP. Both Bastion (sentinel) and Grid (vector) are at range 2. Orders say medics first, but there's no enemy medic visible. Grid is a vector (denial), so I must avoid going adjacent. Bastion is a sentinel - lower priority than a damage dealer, but it's in range. Grid is the vector and poses a threat with denial zone. I should use precision_shot on Grid to reduce their effectiveness, since I haven't moved this turn so I get full 2dmg. I'll stay in place to ensure I don't move adjacent to Grid.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(5,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/7 HP — very low, need to be careful. Patch is critical at dist=1 (5,3) — I can attack to finish them. Longshot is healthy at dist=2 (5,4) — in range but dangerous. I'm adjacent to Patch, so my Denial passive blocks their abilities. Attacking Patch could eliminate a healer. After attacking, I should move away to avoid Longshot's counterattack. Move to (3,3) to create distance while staying near chokepoints.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(5,5) ✓ → attack(5,4) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (5,4), distance 2 from my position (4,5). I need to move closer to engage and protect Grid at (3,3). Moving to (5,5) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (5,4) - wait, that's distance 1, so I can attack. But (5,5) is available in valid moves. Alternatively, move to (4,4) to close distance. If I move to (5,5), Longshot is at (5,4) which is adjacent (south), so I can attack. That's better - intercept Longshot before they can fire on Grid. Moving to (5,5) and attacking Longshot.
  State: Phantom 3/5, Longshot 4/5, Bastion 12/12, Grid 2/7 | Dead: Patch, Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Grid is the enemy damage dealer (vector) and is wounded — priority target. I can reach (4,3) which is directly behind Grid (facing W, so east side is behind). Move to (4,3) then breach Grid from behind. This uses my second breach charge and disrupts the vector's denial field.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (5,5) — precision_shot requires LoS and is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Bastion is a sentinel not Vector. However, precision_shot deals 1dmg if I moved, so I should shoot before moving. Bastion is only 1 tile away (adjacent), so precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles — it works. But wait, precision_shot says 'blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' — Grid is a vector but 3 tiles away, so no blocking. However, Bastion is adjacent to me and I need LoS. I can fire precision_shot at Bastion for 2dmg first, then move away to maintain distance. Best move tile is (5,3) or (5,2) to pull back south away from Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is 2 tiles south at (5,3), I'm at (5,5). Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Longshot and I can attack. Grid ally is wounded at (3,3). Moving south to (5,4) intercepts Longshot and gets me in attack range. I'll move to (5,4) then attack Longshot.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(3,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 2HP, very low. Phantom is adjacent at (4,3) wounded, Longshot at (5,3) wounded. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Phantom is adjacent so pulse would hit them for 1dmg. I'm also denying Phantom's abilities since they're adjacent. With 2HP I need to be careful. Pulse Phantom for 1dmg (they're wounded, might finish or cripple them), then move away to safety. Moving to (2,3) or (2,4) gets me away from both enemies. I have traps at (1,4) and (3,4) already placed. Let me pulse first (hits Phantom for 1dmg), then move west to (2,3) to create distance.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 2HP, cloaked. Orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer. Grid(vector) is the denial threat at (2,3) — I'm already behind it at (3,3). But Grid is wounded and a vector (support/denial). Bastion(sentinel) is the defensive unit. The enemy damage dealer would be Grid or another unit — but with only these two enemies visible, Grid(vector) is wounded and behind-reachable. Moving to (3,3) puts me behind Grid, then I can breach Grid to neutralize the denial threat and let Longshot finish it. Breach on Grid: it will obey me next turn, removing the cloak/ability denial threat. This is tactically superior — breach the vector to eliminate denial, then we can operate freely. Move to (3,3), then breach Grid.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (5,4) — precision_shot requires LoS and is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector (Grid is 3 away, not adjacent, so that's fine), but precision_shot needs range ≤2 and I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. However Bastion is adjacent (dist=1), so I should move first to get range then shoot. Move to (4,3) to get dist=2 from Bastion at (5,4), then precision_shot for full 2dmg.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(2,3) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 2HP, adjacent to Phantom at (3,3). Phantom is wounded and adjacent - my Denial passive blocks their cloak. I should pulse now to hit both Phantom (dist=1) and potentially Longshot isn't in pulse range (dist=2). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile AoE, so it hits Phantom at dist=1. After pulsing, I should move west to (1,3) or (0,3) to create distance and survive. At 2HP I need to be cautious. Pulse Phantom first (1dmg to adjacent units including Phantom), then move west to safety.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (5,4) with 50% damage reduction. Longshot is at distance 2, Phantom at distance 3 - neither in melee range. Grid ally is wounded at (1,3). I should advance to close the gap on Longshot while maintaining pressure. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,3), allowing an attack. However (3,4) and (4,4) have a trap at (3,4) - avoid that. Move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Longshot, then attack.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Orders say prioritize assassinating enemy damage dealer. Grid is the vector (denial unit, wounded) at (1,3) and I'm already behind it at (2,3). Bastion is the sentinel at (4,4). The enemy damage dealer to prioritize would be Grid (wounded vector) or Bastion. Orders say use breach on sentinels — Bastion is the sentinel. I can reach (5,4) which is behind Bastion and use breach. But at 1HP I need to be careful. Grid is wounded and I'm behind it — shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1dmg. But I'm already cloaked (or not — the tip says round 10, don't recloak). Let me focus: move to (2,3) which is behind Grid (wounded, dist=1, adjacent) and shadow_strike Grid to potentially finish it off. Grid is wounded so likely low HP. Shadow_strike keeps cloak, 1dmg. This is the safest play — I stay cloaked, damage a wounded enemy from behind. Grid denial blocks cloak/breach if adjacent, but shadow_strike is allowed. Move to (2,3) then shadow_strike Grid at (1,3).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 2HP, Bastion is adjacent at (4,4). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemies (wait - that's Vector's restriction, not mine). But orders say maintain distance. Bastion is healthy at dist=1, Grid is critical at dist=3. I should move away from Bastion to get range, then use precision_shot. Moving to (5,2) puts me at dist ~2.8 from Bastion - let me check: from (5,2) to (4,4) = sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, still in range 2? No, range≤2 tiles means dist≤2. From (5,4) to (4,4) = dist=1, still adjacent. From (4,2) to (4,4) = dist=2, exactly range 2. But precision_shot does 1dmg if moved. Let me move to (4,2) to keep dist=2 from Bastion, then use precision_shot for 1dmg (since moved). Or stay and use precision_shot for 2dmg - Bastion is at dist=1, which is ≤2, so I can shoot now without moving for full 2dmg. Shoot first, then move away.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically vulnerable. Phantom is adjacent at (2,3) and critical. I need to either finish Phantom or escape. I can attack Phantom for 1dmg which should finish them (critical = very low HP). My denial passive is already blocking their abilities. Attack Phantom first to eliminate the threat, then move away from danger toward safety. Moving to (0,3) puts distance from Longshot too.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (0,3) critical and I'm at (4,4). Longshot is at (5,2) wounded but out of melee range. I should move closer to Longshot to threaten them while positioning between enemy and allies. Moving to (5,3) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (5,2), letting me attack. However, I'm currently fortified which gives 50% damage reduction - moving loses that. Longshot is wounded so attacking could finish them. Moving to (5,3) gets me adjacent to Longshot for attack. The traps at (1,4) and (3,4) are not on my path. Moving to (5,3) then attacking Longshot is the right play.
