## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at distance 4, exactly at scan limit. I can scan it now from current position. Hawk and Phantom are out of range. I'll scan Rampart first, then move north to close range on more targets next turn.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(3,5) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move toward Lens (oracle) at (2,3), the highest-value target. I'm at (3,5), Lens is 3 tiles away facing N. After cloaking, advance toward (3,3) to close distance while staying invisible.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is in range at dist 3. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Take the shot first, then reposition to (5,4) to maintain distance from enemies and keep sight lines open.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Rampart at dist 4, Hawk at dist 5). Need to close distance. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to both enemies while staying away from the front line. From there I still can't shoot but I'll be better positioned for next round. Orders say maintain distance, so I shouldn't rush in — I'll advance cautiously to (3,3) to get within potential range next turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is adjacent at (2,3) — attack it immediately. Then use shield_wall facing South to protect allies from the enemy cluster below. Orders say push forward aggressively, but Lens is right here and worth hitting first.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are distant. Move forward to (4,2) to get closer to the action, then place a trap at (4,3) to block the approach corridor between the enemy Hawk at (5,4) and our position. This creates area denial on a likely enemy path.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Lens 5/6, Snare 7/7, Rampart 11/12, Hawk 5/5, Phantom 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → scan(5,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) - scan is blocked if adjacent to enemy Vector, but Rampart is a sentinel not a Vector, so scan should work. However, I already have Rampart's prompt. Hawk(striker,E) at (5,4) is at dist=4, in scan range, and I don't have their prompt yet. I need to move away from Rampart first (adjacent is dangerous, Rampart attacked me last turn), then scan Hawk. Moving to (1,3) keeps distance from Rampart and maintains scan range to Hawk at dist=5... wait, (1,3) to (5,4) = 4+1=5, out of range. Let me check: from (1,4) to (5,4) = dist 4, in range. From (0,4) to (5,4) = dist 5, out of range. Best: move to (1,4) first, then scan Hawk at (5,4) from dist=4. That gets me away from Rampart and reveals Hawk's prompt.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Lens (oracle) is the highest-value target — oracles provide vision/support. I can reach (1,3) which is behind Lens at (1,4). Moving there puts me adjacent and behind for a breach next turn. However, Snare (vector) is at (4,2) and I need to avoid moving adjacent to it. Path to (1,3) goes through (2,3) or similar — dist=3 from my position, exactly within my move range. Let me move to (1,3) to get behind Lens, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✗ Out of range → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Snare(vector) is at (4,2), dist 3 — in range for precision_shot from current position (5,4). However, Snare is healthy and I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. I need to stay at (5,4) to keep range. Moving adjacent to Snare would block precision_shot. Fire precision_shot at Snare first, then consider repositioning. (5,4) is not adjacent to Snare so no blocking issue. After firing, I can move to (5,5) or (4,5) to gain distance from Snare and stay away from Vector denial range.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Both Rampart (dist=4) and Hawk (dist=6) are out of range. Orders say maintain distance. I should move to get Rampart in range (dist≤2) while staying safe. Moving to (3,3) brings me closer but still not in range. Let me check: from (3,3) to Rampart at (2,4) = dist of sqrt(1+1)=1.4, so Manhattan dist = |3-2|+|3-4|=2, which is in range for precision_shot. Move to (3,3) then shoot Rampart.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) facing N. There's already a trap at (4,3). Enemies are Rampart @(2,4) approaching from NW and Hawk @(5,5) approaching from NE. I need to control the approach paths. Moving to (5,3) gets me between the enemy Hawk and my allies while allowing me to place a trap on a chokepoint. From (5,3) I can place a trap at (4,4) or (5,4) to catch the enemy Hawk approaching from (5,5). Let me move to (5,3) and place a trap at (5,4) to create a kill zone on the Hawk's likely approach path.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (1,4) — prime target for attack. After attacking, I can move to (3,4) to push forward toward the enemy cluster. Fortify is lost on move but I'll be engaging aggressively per orders.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Lens 3/6, Snare 7/7, Rampart 10/12, Hawk 4/5, Phantom 5/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is wounded and directly adjacent at (1,4) — I'm already behind it (I'm at (1,3), it faces N). I can use breach on Lens to take control, which is high value since oracles provide support. Cloak has 1 turn remaining, so I should use breach now while cloaked. I'm already in position behind Lens — no move needed, just breach.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, no offensive abilities. Allies are at (3,3) and (5,3), so I should move toward the opposite edge. Top-left corner area is away from allies. Phantom is adjacent at (1,3) and attacked me last turn — I need to get away. Moving to (0,5) puts me at the top-left edge, maximally away from allies clustered on the right side. Then I can recalibrate or wait — but no offensive abilities. I'll wait as second action.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare(vector) is at (5,3), 2 tiles away — if I stay at (5,5) I can use precision_shot on Snare without moving, keeping full 2dmg. Snare is healthy but killing/weakening it removes the ability-denial threat. I haven't moved so precision_shot fires at full 2dmg. Lens is wounded but at dist=5, out of range. Best play: precision_shot Snare now, then wait or reposition. Since Snare is exactly 2 tiles away and in range, shoot first, then reassess.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart sentinel is adjacent at (3,4) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Phantom specter at (1,3) dist=2 is in range and I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. Move away from Rampart first to open precision_shot options, then shoot Phantom. Moving to (2,4) keeps distance from Rampart and maintains range to Phantom. After moving, precision_shot on Phantom deals 1dmg (moved penalty). Alternatively, shoot Phantom first before moving for full 2dmg, then reposition. Shoot Phantom first at dist=2 for 2dmg, then move to (2,2) to maintain distance from Rampart and Phantom.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 No enemies in range currently. Orders say push forward aggressively. Enemy Hawk is at (2,2) dist=3, Snare at (5,3) dist=3 (must avoid adjacent). Moving to (2,3) closes on Hawk to dist=1 for next turn attack, while staying away from Snare. Then shield_wall facing S toward enemy cluster.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk(striker) is at (5,5), dist=2 and in range. I already have traps at (4,3) and (5,4). Moving north toward Hawk is risky. Best play: use attack on Hawk at (5,5) — wait, attack is adjacent only and dist=2. Can I reach (5,4)? Yes, (5,4) is a valid move but there's already a trap there. Move to (4,4) to get closer while avoiding my own trap at (5,4), then attack won't reach Hawk at dist still 2. Alternative: place a trap to channel Hawk. Valid moves include (5,2) to block south approach. Actually, Hawk is at (5,5) heading toward me. Trap at (5,4) already exists — good. I should move to (4,4) to maintain pressure and place a trap at (4,5) to cut off Hawk's escape/approach route. Wait — can I place trap at (4,5)? My range for trap is ≤2 tiles from current pos (5,3). (4,5) is dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.24, over 2. (4,4) from (5,3) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.41, valid. From (4,4), trap at (4,5) would be dist=1, valid. Plan: move to (4,4), then place trap at (3,4) to block Rampart approach corridor.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Lens 3/6, Snare 4/7, Rampart 10/12, Hawk 4/5, Phantom 2/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, no offensive abilities. Allies are at (2,2) and (4,4). I'm at (0,5) — top-left corner already. Moving to (3,5) gets me to the top edge and away from allies clustered in the center-left area.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/5 HP, so I need to play carefully. Breach is on cooldown (1 turn). Lens (oracle) is wounded and reachable behind at (2,5) — that's a high-value target I can shadow_strike while cloaked. Moving to (2,5) puts me behind Lens and adjacent for shadow_strike. That finishes or heavily damages the oracle. Hawk is healthy and nearby at dist 2, but I'd need to get to (2,3) to be behind — that tile isn't reachable per behind options. Lens is the priority: wounded, high-value, reachable behind.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I need to create distance first. Moving to (4,2) gets me away from Rampart and closer to range on Phantom. From (4,2), Phantom at (2,5) is dist=3 which is out of range-2. Let me move to (3,3) — dist to Rampart becomes 2, enabling precision_shot. Check: (3,3) to (2,3) = dist 1+0=1... still adjacent. Move to (3,1) — dist to Rampart=(2,3) is sqrt(1+4)~2.2, Manhattan=3, out of adjacent range. From (3,1) Rampart at (2,3): range check needs ≤2 tiles Manhattan = |3-2|+|1-3|=1+2=3, out of precision_shot range too. Try (2,4): dist to Rampart=(2,3) is 1 — still adjacent. Try (1,3): dist to Rampart=(2,3) is Manhattan=1+0=1, adjacent. Try (3,3): |3-2|+|3-3|=1 — adjacent. Try (4,2): |4-2|+|2-3|=2+1=3 — not adjacent! From (4,2), Rampart at (2,3): Manhattan=3, out of precision_shot range 2. From (4,2), Phantom at (2,5): |4-2|+|2-5|=2+3=5, still out. Best option: move to (3,3) first — wait, that's adjacent. Move to (1,2): dist to Rampart=(2,3)=|1-2|+|2-3|=2, precision_shot range ≤2 tiles, not adjacent — valid! Fire precision_shot on Rampart from (1,2).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens is wounded and at distance 2 — prime target for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Snare is also wounded at dist 2 but using precision_shot on Lens is the priority kill. After firing, I can wait or hold position. No need to move — staying at (5,5) keeps distance from Snare's denial zone at (4,4).
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk(striker) is at (5,5), distance 2 and in range. I'm at (4,4) facing N. My traps are already at (4,3), (5,4), (3,4) covering southern approaches. Hawk is adjacent-ish - I can attack for 1dmg, or pulse would hit Hawk at dist 1 if I move to (4,5) or (5,5)... but pulse hits ALL within 1 tile including me. Better to place a trap to block Hawk's movement paths or attack directly. Attack range is adjacent only (dist 1), so I can't attack Hawk at dist 2. I can move to (5,5) but that's where Hawk is. Move to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,5) - then I can attack for 1dmg. Or I could use pulse from (4,5) to hit Hawk (dist 1) for 1dmg but it also damages me. Attack is safer. Let me move to (4,5) and attack Hawk.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → attack(1,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Hawk is at (1,2), dist 2 from my position (2,3). I need to move adjacent to attack. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (1,2). Allies Hawk and Phantom are wounded to the north. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. Moving to (1,3) gets me adjacent to enemy Hawk for a melee attack.

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → breach(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/5 HP and need to be careful. Snare (vector) is 2 tiles away at (4,5) - wounded and high priority. I can move to (4,4) which is behind Snare, adjacent, and within breach range. But Snare's denial zone blocks abilities when adjacent. Wait - the caution says avoid moving ADJACENT to Snare or abilities will be blocked. (4,4) is adjacent to (4,5), so breach would be blocked there. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best play: move to (3,4) to stay out of Snare's denial zone while repositioning, then shadow_strike isn't in range. Actually, Hawk (enemy striker) at (1,2) is healthy and 4 tiles away - behind tile is (2,2) which is reachable. I can move to (2,2) and be adjacent+behind Hawk for breach. That's a high-value target and I have breach ready. Move to (2,2) puts me adjacent and behind Hawk - perfect for breach.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare (wounded vector) at (4,5), which means precision_shot is blocked by denial zone. I can only use basic attack or move. Snare is wounded so I should kill it with basic attack (adjacent), then move away. Attack first to eliminate Snare, then move to (5,3) to get distance and better positioning.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) with enemies adjacent: Rampart at (1,3) and Phantom at (2,2). Orders say move away from allies toward (4,5). Phantom is wounded and adjacent - I can't use precision_shot when adjacent to enemies, but I can use suppressing_fire or attack. However, orders prioritize moving toward (4,5). I should move toward (4,5) to follow orders. Best move toward (4,5) from valid tiles: (3,2) gets me closer to (4,5). After moving to (3,2), Phantom at (2,2) is dist=1 (adjacent), Rampart at (1,3) is dist=2 - Phantom still in range. From (3,2) Phantom is adjacent so precision_shot blocked. I can attack Phantom for 1dmg or use suppressing_fire. Attack Phantom to finish it off (it's wounded).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Phantom is critical at (2,2) and needs protection. Hawk enemy is at (3,2) distance 3. I should advance toward the enemy cluster while positioning to shield Phantom. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to enemy Hawk and puts me between them and Phantom. From (3,3) I can use shield_wall facing S or E to cover Phantom and block enemy Hawk.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 3/7 HP. Enemies are at dist 3 - not in range yet. I have existing traps at (4,3), (5,4), (3,4). I need to move closer to control the approach. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to my own trap at (4,3) - bad. Moving to (3,5) then placing a trap could work. My ally Hawk is at (3,2). Rampart at (3,3) and enemy Hawk at (5,3) are closing in. The trap at (3,4) already covers Rampart's path. I should move to (4,4) - wait, that's in my valid moves but has a trap at (5,4) nearby. Let me move to (3,5) to cover the left flank approach, then place a trap at (3,4)... but (3,4) already has a trap. Move to (4,4) and place trap at (4,3)... already trapped. Move to (5,5) and place trap at (5,4)... already trapped. I should move to (2,5) to cover a new angle, then place a trap at (3,4)... already has one. Best option: move to (4,4) to use Denial to block enemy abilities when they close in, and place trap at (3,3) - but wait, that's where Rampart is standing so I can't trap occupied tiles. Place trap at (4,2) - need to check range from (4,4): dist to (4,2) = 2, valid. That covers the approach corridor.

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical. Hawk is adjacent at (3,2), I'm already behind it. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg, keeps cloak if I have it (I don't currently). I should use shadow_strike to damage Hawk — it's my best offensive option at 1HP with no breach left. After striking, I need to survive, so I'll move away to safety.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is at (4,4), dist 2 — wounded and in range. Hawk (striker) is at (3,2), dist 3 — also wounded and in range. Priority is to finish off wounded enemies. Snare is closer and poses denial threat if I move adjacent. I'm at (5,3), haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Snare has wounded status — 2dmg should finish it. I'll fire precision_shot at Snare first, then use second action to precision_shot Hawk if able, or wait. Actually I only get one ability per turn. So: precision_shot Snare (2dmg, likely kill), then wait or move to reposition. Stay put to avoid moving penalty on precision_shot.
- **Hawk** (striker): suppressing_fire(1,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward (4,5) snare vector. Phantom is critical at (1,2) and in range - I could precision_shot for 2dmg to finish them. But orders say move away from allies toward (4,5). Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) so precision_shot is blocked. I can attack Rampart for 1dmg or use suppressing_fire. Best play: move to (4,1) to follow orders toward (4,5), then precision_shot Phantom at dist=2 for 2dmg to finish them off (Phantom at (1,2) would be dist=3 from (4,1) - out of range). Actually from current pos (3,2), Phantom is at dist=2, in range. If I shoot first then move, precision_shot Phantom (critical) for likely kill, then move toward (4,5). But Rampart is adjacent - precision_shot blocked! Use suppressing_fire on Phantom instead? suppressing_fire hits 2-tile line from target. Or just attack Rampart adjacent for 1dmg. Orders prioritize movement. Move to (4,1) first (away from Rampart adjacency), then from (4,1) Phantom is at dist=sqrt(9+1)=~3.16, out of range. Move to (3,1) - Phantom dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.24 out of range. Best: use suppressing_fire on Phantom now (range 2, not blocked by adjacency unlike precision_shot), then move toward (4,5) objective.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,2) S ✓
  💭 Enemy Hawk is at (4,1), distance 3 - out of attack range. Allied Hawk is at (5,3) wounded and needs protection. I should advance toward the enemy to close distance while positioning to shield my ally. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to the enemy Hawk and adjacent to my ally's flank. From there I can shield_wall facing S toward the enemy threat.

### Turn 7 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 Wounded Hawk is at (4,1), dist=3 which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 exceeds range 2). Need to close distance. Move to (5,1) to get dist=2 from Hawk at (4,1), then precision_shot for 2dmg to finish the wounded enemy. Check: from (5,1) to (4,1) = dist=1, well within range. Since I'm moving first, precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). Alternatively move to (4,3): dist to (4,1)=2, within range, then precision_shot for 1dmg (moved). Best: move to (5,1) - dist=1 to Hawk, then precision_shot for 1dmg. Actually wounded Hawk - need to know their remaining HP. Since wounded, likely low. 1dmg may finish them. Move to (5,1) is in valid moves list, then precision_shot.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(5,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward (4,5). I'm at (4,1) with enemies adjacent at (4,2) and (5,1). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I can move to (4,3) which is closer to target (4,5) — wait, (4,3) has a trap. Next best is (3,2) to reposition away from both enemies, then use suppressing_fire or attack. Actually valid moves include (4,3) but it's a trap. Move to (3,2) to break adjacency with both enemies, then precision_shot Hawk (wounded, will finish them) from range 2 — but after moving I need LoS and range check. From (3,2) to Hawk at (5,1): dist = sqrt(4+1) ≈ 2.2, beyond range 2. From (3,2) to Rampart at (4,2): dist = sqrt(1+0) = 1, adjacent, so precision_shot blocked again. Move to (5,2) instead — dist to Hawk(5,1)=1 adjacent, still blocked. Move to (3,1): dist to Rampart(4,2)=sqrt(1+1)≈1.4, not adjacent; dist to Hawk(5,1)=2, not adjacent. From (3,1) precision_shot Hawk at (5,1): dist=2, in range, not adjacent to enemy — valid! Hawk is wounded, 2dmg will finish. But I moved so only 1dmg. Still worth it.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,1) ✓
  💭 Enemy Hawk is at (3,1), distance 2 — not in melee range yet. Ally Hawk is at (5,1) wounded. Orders say push forward aggressively. I should move to (3,2) to close to adjacent range on the enemy Hawk at (3,1), then attack. Moving loses Fortify but engaging the enemy is the priority per orders.
