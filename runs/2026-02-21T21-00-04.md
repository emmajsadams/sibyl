## Squads
### Player
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
### Opponent
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is at (3,1), distance 4 — exactly at scan range from my current position (3,5). I can scan Viper now to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. I should stay put and scan, then wait. Moving closer risks adjacency to Viper which would block scan. Current position is safe.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Bulwark at (1,4) is closest at dist 5. Moving north toward (0,3) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying cloaked.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Viper is at dist=4, Aegis at dist=6. I need to close distance to get Viper in range (range 2). Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Viper at (3,1) - that would put Viper at dist=2, within precision_shot range. But I need to avoid getting adjacent to Viper (vector denial). From (4,2), Viper at (3,1) is dist=2, not adjacent, so precision_shot is safe. However, moving means precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Better to move to (4,2) and still shoot for 1dmg than wait. Actually, let me check: from (4,2) to (3,1) is sqrt(1+1)=1.41, so dist=2 in Manhattan? Manhattan: |4-3|+|2-1|=1+1=2. Yes, in range! I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg. Worth it to start dealing damage.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (4,2), distance 2, within my range. I can place a trap on a tile between enemies and allies to control movement. Moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Bolt enabling denial, but I'm at 5/7 HP so I should be cautious. Better to place a trap at (3,2) to intercept enemy advance, then move to a safer position. Actually, I can trap (3,3) to block the path from Bulwark/Insight pushing south, while staying at range to threaten Bolt. Let me trap (4,2)... wait, Bolt is there. Trap (3,3) to block enemy advance from north, then move to (4,1) to get adjacent to Bolt for denial and pressure.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Enemies are all far away. Push forward aggressively toward the enemy cluster (Bulwark at 1,4 and Bolt at 4,2). Move to 2,2 to advance. No adjacent allies to shield_wall yet, and no enemies in range to attack. Set up shield_wall facing North toward the enemy cluster to prepare for incoming damage.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (2,2) distance 3, need to close in. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Aegis next turn and closer to the enemy cluster. Then shield_wall facing South toward enemy approach to protect allies behind me.
  State: Aegis 11/11, Veil 5/5, Viper 5/7, Bolt 5/5, Bulwark 11/11, Insight 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Bulwark at (2,3) facing S — behind tile is (2,4) which is reachable in 1 step. I should move to (2,4) to get behind Bulwark, then use breach to take control of this sentinel. That's a high-value play — a sentinel under our control is a powerful asset.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at dist=2 and in scan range. Scanning Veil reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage — high value. Aegis is at exactly dist=4 but the range check shows inRange:false, so I can't scan them from here. Viper is already known. After scanning Veil, I should reposition to maintain distance. Moving to (4,5) keeps me away from Viper's trap at (3,3) and Aegis moving to (2,2). Veil moved last turn toward (0,3) so they're mobile — scan now before they escape range.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper (vector) at (4,1) which activates DENIAL zone, blocking my abilities. I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (5,2) gets me out of denial range while keeping Aegis at distance 3 (out of range 2). Better to move to (3,3) which exits denial and keeps Aegis at dist ~1.4 — actually let me check: from (3,2) Aegis at (2,2) is dist=1, too close. From (5,2) Aegis is at dist=3, out of range. From (4,3) Aegis is at dist ~2.2, out of range. I need to be exactly 2 tiles from Aegis for precision_shot. From (4,3): |4-2|+|3-2|=3, out of range. From (3,3): |3-2|+|3-2|=2, in range! And (3,3) is distance 2 from Viper so no denial. Move to (3,3) then precision_shot Aegis at (2,2) for 2dmg (didn't move before shot... wait I moved first). Moving first means precision_shot deals 1dmg. Still worth it to escape denial. Actually: move to (5,2) keeps me safer from Viper, but Aegis out of range. Move to (3,3): exits denial, Aegis in range but shot is 1dmg due to moving. Best option: move to (4,3) to exit denial, then basic attack won't reach Aegis (dist 2.2). Or move to (5,2), no shot. Move to (3,3) for 1dmg on Aegis via precision_shot after moving.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (2,3) — I can attack immediately. I'm fortified so I should avoid moving to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark first, then use shield_wall facing North to protect allies from the enemy cluster (Bolt at 3,3, Bulwark at 2,3).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward enemy striker at (4,2) and attack next turn. I need to close distance. Currently at (2,3), target is (4,2). Moving to (3,2) gets me closer — dist 2 from (4,2). I'm fortified so I lose that if I move, but orders are to advance. I have Aegis adjacent at (2,2) and Veil at (2,4) — tempting to attack but orders override. Move toward (3,2) to close on striker. No ability needed this turn.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,1) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent-range (dist=2), so I can't trap (blocked by Denial if adjacent, but dist=2 means not adjacent). Actually Bulwark is at (3,2) and I'm at (4,1) - distance is 2, not adjacent (adjacent=1). So trap IS available. I should place a trap on a tile between enemy positions to control the approach. Moving to (3,1) puts me adjacent to Bulwark which would block trap. Better to move to (5,1) or (4,2) to stay at distance, then place trap on a chokepoint like (3,1) or (4,2) that enemies would cross. From current position (4,1), I can trap within ≤2 tiles. Tile (3,2) is where Bulwark stands - can't trap occupied. Tile (3,1) is a good chokepoint between Bulwark and my position. I'll place trap at (3,1) from current position, then move to (5,1) to maintain distance from Bulwark and keep pressure.
  State: Aegis 10/11, Veil 4/5, Viper 5/7, Bolt 4/5, Bulwark 10/11, Insight 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,5) ✓
  💭 Insight is isolated at (4,5) facing E, and (3,5) is reachable and puts me behind them. Move to (3,5) then shadow_strike — stays cloaked, deals damage to the oracle.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (3,5) distance 1 — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Veil is a specter not a vector. However, Veil is already scanned. I'm at risk with Veil adjacent and about to move to (2,4) per foresight. I should move away first to get range on Aegis (dist 5, out of scan range regardless). Best move: retreat to (5,5) or (5,4) to increase distance from Veil, then scan Aegis if possible — but Aegis at dist 5 is still out of range from anywhere I can reach. Viper at (5,1) is also out of range. I should move to (5,4) to stay safe and away from Veil, then wait since no valid scan targets are in range.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both Aegis and Veil are in range at dist=2. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is available. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Veil is a specter (likely more dangerous/mobile), Aegis is a sentinel. Both healthy. Orders say prioritize wounded enemies - none wounded, so I'll shoot Veil with precision_shot for 2dmg. Then I can use suppressing_fire on Aegis to slow them, or take another shot. Actually I only get one ability per turn. I'll precision_shot Veil (specter, threatening from north at 3,5) for 2dmg. No move needed - stay put to avoid moving penalty.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with enemies approaching. Insight is at (5,4) directly north, dist=3. Bulwark at (3,2), Bolt at (3,3). There's already a trap at (3,1). I should move toward the center to threaten enemies and place a trap along the likely approach path. Moving to (5,3) closes distance to Insight and puts me in range next turn. Better to move to (4,2) and place a trap at (4,1) or (5,2) to catch enemies moving toward our allies. Actually, Insight at (5,4) is moving south toward me - I should place a trap at (5,2) to intercept. I can move to (4,2) first, then trap (5,2) which is within 2 tiles of (4,2).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward enemy striker at (4,2) and attack next turn. Currently fortified at (3,2). Moving to (4,2) would position me adjacent to the striker for next turn attack, but I'd lose fortify. I can move to (4,2) directly — that's within my mv2 range. However, Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) and I could attack it now while fortified. But orders say move toward striker at (4,2). I'll move to (4,2) to be in position, losing fortify but following orders. No ability needed this turn.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Bolt is at (3,3) dist=2, Bulwark at (4,2) dist=2. Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. If I move to (3,2), I'll be adjacent to both Bolt at (3,3) and Bulwark at (4,2), letting me attack one. Moving to (3,2) puts me next to Bolt (N) and Bulwark (E). I'll move to (3,2) then attack Bolt who is directly north.
  State: Aegis 10/11, Veil 2/5, Viper 5/7, Bolt 3/5, Bulwark 10/11, Insight 5/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Insight is at (5,4) facing S, with (5,5) being behind them and reachable. I can move to (5,5) and then shadow_strike Insight — shadow_strike keeps cloak (if I had it) and deals 1dmg. Insight is healthy but isolated. Moving to (5,5) puts me adjacent and behind Insight, perfect for shadow_strike which works at adjacent range.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper which blocks my scan ability. I need to move away from Viper's denial zone first. Moving to (4,4) gets me away from Viper at (5,3) and Veil at (5,5), while Aegis at (3,2) is dist=4 from (4,4) — borderline. From (4,4) I can try to scan Aegis. Foresight shows Viper moving to (5,3) and placing trap at (4,3), so I should avoid (4,3). Move to (4,5) keeps me at distance from Viper and lets me scan Aegis from dist=3. Actually (3,5) gives dist=3 to Aegis at (3,2), well within scan range, and gets me far from Viper. Let me move to (3,5) then scan Aegis at (3,2).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. Viper is at dist=2 but is a vector — moving adjacent would block my abilities. I can use suppressing_fire on Viper at (5,3) to slow them down. But first I should move away from Aegis to enable precision_shot. Moving to (2,3) puts me dist=2 from Aegis (enabling precision_shot) and dist=3 from Viper (safe). From (2,3), Aegis at (3,2) is still within range 2. Fire precision_shot at Aegis.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to move toward enemy striker at (4,2) — but I'm already at (4,2) and there's no enemy striker here. Aegis (sentinel) is adjacent at (3,2). I'll stay put to maintain Fortify passive (50% damage reduction) and attack Aegis since it's in range. This satisfies the spirit of engaging nearby enemies while keeping defensive advantage.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at dist=2, in range. I'm at (5,3). Trap at (4,3) already exists. I should move to pressure or use denial. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (4,2) - that activates Denial and blocks their abilities. Then I can attack or trap. Wait, (4,3) has a trap already so I can't place there. Moving to (4,4) gets me adjacent to Bulwark (dist=2 diagonally - actually Manhattan dist=2). Let me check: Bulwark at (4,2), me at (4,4) = dist 2, not adjacent. Adjacent means dist=1. To be adjacent to Bulwark I need to be at (3,2),(5,2),(4,1),(4,3) - but (4,3) has a trap. I can't step on my own trap safely. Move to (5,2) puts me at dist=1 from Bulwark at (4,2) - adjacent! That activates Denial. Then attack Bulwark for 1 dmg.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction. Bulwark is adjacent at (4,2) — I can attack it. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Bolt is at (2,3) to my northwest. If I stay put, I keep fortify bonus and can attack Bulwark. Shield_wall facing E would protect against Bulwark. But orders say attack when possible — I'll attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall facing E to block further damage from that direction. Staying in place preserves fortify.
  State: Aegis 7/11, Veil 2/5, Viper 5/7, Bolt 3/5, Bulwark 8/11, Insight 4/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 2HP, facing E. Insight is at (3,5) facing W, distance 2. I'm already behind Insight (behind tile is (4,5)). I can move to (4,5) which puts me adjacent and behind Insight, then use breach to take control of the oracle — a high-value target. Breach is ready and this is the most dangerous enemy (oracle has high utility). With only 2HP I need to act decisively before I'm caught.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward allied lines and away from enemies. I'm at (3,5) with Veil adjacent at (4,5) — dangerous. Allies are around (2,3) and (4,2). I need to move away from Veil and toward allies. Moving to (2,4) gets me away from Veil and closer to Bolt at (2,3). No offensive abilities per orders.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (3,2), distance 2 - in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. However, I'm not adjacent to Viper so no denial issue. Veil is wounded and priority target but out of range at dist 4. Best play: shoot Aegis with precision_shot now (2dmg) before moving, then reposition. Wait as second action since Veil and Viper are out of range.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) E ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (4,2). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall facing East to protect against Bulwark and the eastern threat. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at 7/11 HP with two enemies adjacent: Aegis (wounded) to my west at (3,2) and Viper (healthy) to my east at (5,2). Viper's denial zone is blocking my abilities, so I need to move away from Viper first to enable my abilities. If I move to (3,3), I'm away from Viper's denial zone and still adjacent to Aegis. Then I can attack Aegis (wounded) to try to finish them off. Shield_wall isn't as valuable here since attacking the wounded sentinel is higher priority per orders to push aggressively.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with no enemies in range. Enemies are clustering around (2-3, 3-4). I have traps at (3,1) and (4,3) already. I should move closer and place a trap to control the approach. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while staying safe, then I can place a trap at (4,3)... wait, (4,3) already has a trap. Moving to (4,2) and placing a trap at (3,2) would be risky since Aegis is there. Best move: go to (5,1) to reposition, or move to (4,2) and trap at (4,1) to block southern approach. Actually, moving to (4,3) is valid - puts me adjacent to existing trap zone. Let me move to (4,2) and trap at (3,2)... no Aegis is there. Trap at (4,1) from (4,2) would create a chokepoint on the southern flank. Bulwark is at (3,3) moving toward allies - trapping between enemies and allies is key. From (4,2), I can trap (3,2) but Aegis is there. Trap (4,1) blocks southern route. Move to (4,2), trap (4,1).
  State: Aegis 5/11, Veil 2/5, Viper 5/7, Bolt 3/5, Bulwark 7/11, Insight 4/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 2HP, cloaked. Breach is exhausted. Insight is at (2,4) facing S, meaning (2,5) is directly behind them and reachable in 1 step — and I'm adjacent to that tile. If I move to (2,5), I'll be behind Insight and adjacent. Then I can shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while maintaining cloak. Insight is healthy but this keeps pressure on and preserves my cloak for survival.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward allied lines and away from enemies. I'm at (2,4). Veil is adjacent at (2,5) — dangerous. Foresight shows Veil moving to (4,5) then breaching to (3,5), so she's moving away from me. My allies Bolt and Bulwark are at (2,3) and (3,3). I should move toward them and away from enemies. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer to allies and away from Veil. No offensive abilities per orders.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Two wounded enemies in range from current position: Aegis(sentinel) at (3,2) dist=2 and Veil(specter) at (2,5) dist=2. I haven't moved so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Aegis is wounded - a 2dmg precision_shot could finish it. Viper is 3 tiles away, not adjacent, so precision_shot is not blocked. I'll shoot Aegis first to try to kill it, then if I have a second ability... I only get one ability per turn. So: precision_shot Aegis (wounded, likely kills it), then wait or move to safety. No need to move - stay put for full damage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) N ✓
  💭 I'm at 4HP with fortify active (50% DR). Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. If I don't move, I keep fortify. Bulwark is healthy and adjacent - I should attack it. Then shield_wall facing N to protect against the cluster at (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). Staying put preserves fortify.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) — attack to press the wounded enemy. Stay put to keep Fortify active (50% dmg reduction). Shield_wall facing S covers Aegis and Viper cluster below.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(2,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at dist=2, within my range. I have traps at (4,3) and (3,1) already placed. I should pulse Bulwark since they're within 1 tile... wait, pulse hits within 1 tile (adjacent), but Bulwark is at (3,3) and I'm at (4,2) - that's dist=2 (Manhattan), so not adjacent. I can't pulse them. I could move closer to use pulse or deny abilities, or place a trap. Moving to (5,2) keeps me safe and I could trap (4,3) but it's already trapped. Let me move to (5,3) to stay back, then trap a chokepoint. Actually (4,1) has a trap already. Let me place a trap at (3,1)... it already has one. Valid moves include (5,2) or (5,3). Bulwark is at (3,3). If I stay at (4,2) I'm in range to place a trap. My orders say control chokepoints. (5,2) is safe. I'll trap (5,3) or use pulse if I move adjacent to Bulwark. Moving to (4,2)→(3,2)... wait (3,2) is where Aegis is. I can't move there. Let me trap from current position - I can place trap up to 2 tiles away. (2,2) is a valid chokepoint between enemies and allies. Place trap at (2,2) to block enemy advance, then wait or move back.
  State: Aegis 3/11, Veil 2/5, Viper 5/7, Bolt 3/5, Bulwark 6/11, Insight 3/6

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward allied lines and away from enemies. I'm at (1,3) with 3/6 HP. Veil is at (2,5) and used shadow_strike on (2,4) last turn — threat from north. Aegis is at (3,2) to the southeast. Viper laid a trap at (2,2) — avoid that area. I should move away from enemies. Moving to (0,3) or (0,2) keeps me at the western edge away from threats. (0,3) moves me west, away from Veil's likely path and Aegis. Then wait as second action.
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 2HP - very vulnerable. Breach is exhausted. Insight at (0,3) is wounded and I can reach (1,3) which is behind Insight (facing W). Move to (1,3) then shadow_strike Insight - shadow_strike keeps cloak so I stay hidden. This is the best play: eliminate or heavily damage a wounded enemy while staying cloaked.
- **Bolt** (striker): attack(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (1,3) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy. Aegis is at dist=2 and wounded, so I can precision_shot Aegis. But Veil being adjacent means I need to handle that. I can attack Veil (adjacent, 1dmg) then precision_shot Aegis. Wait — orders say prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. Veil is adjacent so precision_shot is blocked. I should attack Veil first (1dmg), then precision_shot Aegis (2dmg). Veil is wounded — if they have low HP, attack might finish them. Aegis is also wounded. Let me attack Veil first, then precision_shot Aegis to maximize kills.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with no enemies in range. Allies Aegis and Veil are both critical. Enemies are clustered around (2-3, 3). I need to advance and support. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer. There's already a trap at (4,3) covering that approach. I should place a trap at (4,2) or move closer to use denial against Bulwark at (3,3) which is dist=3. If I move to (4,3)... wait, there's already a trap there. Valid moves include (4,2). Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist=2 from Bulwark at (3,3) - still not adjacent for denial. Let me move to (4,3) - but trap is there already. Move to (4,2) then place trap at (3,2) to block the path between Bulwark and Aegis at (3,2). Actually Aegis is at (3,2) so I can't trap there. Place trap at (3,3) where Bulwark is? No, can't trap occupied tiles. Place at (4,4) to threaten approach, or at (3,4) to block. Move to (4,2), then trap at (3,3)... Bulwark is there. Try trap at (2,2) - already trapped. Move to (4,2), trap at (3,1) - already trapped. Move to (4,2), trap at (4,4) to cover northern approach.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent and critical — attack to finish. I'm fortified so I should NOT move (keep 50% damage reduction). Viper is 2 tiles away so I must avoid moving adjacent to it. Shield_wall facing S/E to cover allies from the enemy cluster after attacking.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/11 HP — critically low. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) and I can attack. But I need to be careful: if I move I lose Fortify. Viper is at (4,2) healthy and can handle combat. My priority is survival. I should NOT move (keep Fortify's 50% reduction). Bulwark is wounded and adjacent — attack it. Then shield_wall facing N to block damage from Bulwark/Bolt cluster.
  State: Aegis 1/11, Veil 1/5, Viper 5/7, Bolt 3/5, Bulwark 5/11, Insight 2/6

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Critical situation: HP 2/6, Veil is adjacent at (1,3) and will shadow_strike me this turn per Foresight. I need to escape. Valid moves include (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4) etc. Moving to (0,5) gets me far from Veil. All enemy prompts already known. Bolt is attacking Veil at (1,3) which may finish it. I should move away from Veil to survive, then wait — no good scan targets in range after moving (Aegis at dist 4+ from new position, Viper out of range). Move to (0,5) to escape Veil's reach.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Bolt is adjacent and wounded. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg without breaking cloak (if I had it), but I'm not cloaked. I need to finish Bolt or escape. Shadow_strike on Bolt (adjacent) could kill it if wounded means 1HP. Better to use shadow_strike to try to eliminate Bolt rather than move away exposed. After striking, move toward Insight who is behind-reachable at (0,4).
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at dist=2 and critical — precision_shot will finish them. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Viper is 3 tiles away so not adjacent, precision_shot is not blocked. I can fire at Aegis first, then move away from Viper to stay safe.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → pulse(3,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark(sentinel) is adjacent at dist=2, within my denial aura. I'm at 5/7 HP. Traps already placed at (4,3) and (4,1) flanking my position. Bulwark is wounded - pulse won't kill but will chip. I should move to (3,2) to get adjacent to Bulwark for denial suppression and use pulse to hit Bulwark (dist=1 from 3,2 to 3,3). This denies their abilities and deals 1 dmg to finish them if wounded enough, while staying defensive.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 4/11 HP with Fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Viper is adjacent at (3,2) and has DENIAL active blocking my abilities. I can only use basic attack or move. Viper is healthy and a direct threat. I should attack Viper since it's in range and I can't use special abilities anyway due to DENIAL. If I move, I lose Fortify. Best to stay put and attack Viper, keeping the 50% damage reduction.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(0,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,4) with 1HP — critical condition. Insight is adjacent at (0,5) and I'm already behind them. I can shadow_strike Insight (keeps cloak if I have it, does 1dmg to a wounded oracle — likely kills them). But I'm not cloaked. With 1HP I need to eliminate Insight now before they act. I go first in the order (spd3 tied with Insight, but I'm listed first). Shadow_strike requires adjacent — Insight is adjacent at dist=1. Use shadow_strike on Insight to finish them off. No move needed, just strike.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Veil is adjacent at (1,5) and acted before me last round with shadow_strike toward (2,3). Veil is critical HP. Foresight shows Veil will shadow_strike (2,3) then move to (0,4) this round — meaning Veil moves away after striking. I need to survive. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Veil is a specter not a vector. However, scan on Veil is pointless — already scanned. I could attack Veil (adjacent, 1dmg) which might finish off the critical Veil. But I'm at 1HP — if anything hits me I die. I should move away to safety first, then act. Moving to (2,5) or (3,5) gets distance from Veil. Foresight says Veil moves to (0,4) after striking — so Veil won't be at (1,5) after their turn. I should move to (2,5) to get distance, then recalibrate Bolt at (1,3) — but Bolt is not adjacent to (2,5). Or I could recalibrate Bulwark. Actually from (2,5) Bulwark at (3,3) is distance 3 — not adjacent. Bolt at (1,3) from (2,5) is distance 3 — not adjacent either. Recalibrate requires adjacent. My best play: move to (2,4) — that's in valid moves. From (2,4), Bolt at (1,3) is distance sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, adjacent diagonally — unclear if adjacent means cardinal only. Safest: just move away to maximize survival at 1HP. Move to (3,5) to get far from Veil, then wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is at (1,5), distance 2, critical HP. I'm at (1,3) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg — enough to finish a critical enemy. I'm not adjacent to Viper (dist=3), so no blocking. Fire precision_shot at Veil first, then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) - wounded sentinel. I can attack it for 1dmg, and my Denial passive blocks some of its abilities. Bolt is at (1,3) distance 3, Insight critical at (3,5). I have traps at (2,2) already. I should attack Bulwark to finish it off if possible, then move to a safer position. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Bulwark still but gives me a different angle, or I can attack first then move away. Attack Bulwark now, then move west away from the cluster. Traps at (3,1) and (4,1) already cover south. Move to (2,3) to maintain denial on Bulwark while repositioning.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, adjacent to Viper who is wounded. I'm in DENIAL zone so only basic attack/movement work. I should attack Viper to finish them off — they're wounded and adjacent. If I move I lose fortify, so better to attack from current position. Attack Viper at (2,3), then wait to keep fortify for defense.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, critically wounded. Viper is 3 tiles away at (2,3) - already scanned. I need to stay safe. Moving to (4,5) keeps distance from Viper. Ally Bulwark is wounded at (3,3) - not adjacent so can't recalibrate. Bolt is wounded at (1,3). Best play: move further away to (4,5) then wait - I can't scan Viper again usefully (already known), can't recalibrate (no adjacent allies), and attacking requires adjacency. Survival is priority at 1HP.
- **Bolt** (striker): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Adjacent to Viper (dist=1), so precision_shot is BLOCKED by denial zone. Only basic attack or movement work. Viper is wounded - basic attack deals 1dmg. I'm at 2HP so staying adjacent is risky, but killing Viper now is priority. Attack Viper with basic attack first, then move away to safety at (0,3) or (0,4) to create distance.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(2,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Critical situation: HP 2/7, Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) and Bolt is at range 2. I need to survive. Bulwark is wounded and adjacent - my Denial passive is blocking some of their abilities. I should pulse to hit both Bolt and Bulwark if possible. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile from target - if I pulse at my current position or adjacent, I can hit Bulwark at (3,3) which is dist 1. Pulse range is 1 tile AoE centered on target within 1 tile. So pulsing at (3,3) or between us. Actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of me - it's a 1-tile AoE around me. Bolt is at dist 2, out of pulse range. Bulwark at dist 1 is in pulse range. I should pulse to damage Bulwark, then move away to safety. Moving to (1,4) gets me away from Bulwark and Bolt. Or I could move first to get distance. With 2 HP I need to be careful. Pulse Bulwark (wounded) then move to (1,4) to create distance from both enemies.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, fortified, with Viper 3 tiles away. Insight is critical at (4,5). Moving would break fortify and I'm very low HP. Best to hold position, shield_wall toward Viper's direction (NW of me, so face W or N). Facing N covers the approach path. Stay fortified for 50% damage reduction — moving is too risky at 2HP.
