I need to move away from Watcher first to enable precision_shot on Ghost. Moving to (0,3) keeps distance from Watcher and Ghost remains at dist=3 — out of range. Better: move to (1,4) to increase distance from Watcher (now dist=2) while keeping Ghost at dist=2 diagonally... wait, dist is manhattan. Ghost at (3,3), me at (1,4): |3-1|+|3-4|=3, out of range. Move to (2,4): Ghost dist=|3-2|+|3-4|=2, in range; Watcher at (2,3) dist=1, still adjacent — blocks shot. Move to (0,3): Watcher dist=|2-0|+|3-3|=2, not adjacent; Ghost dist=|3-0|+|3-3|=3, out of range. Move to (1,2): Watcher dist=|2-1|+|3-2|=2, not adjacent; Ghost dist=|3-1|+|3-2|=3, out of range. Move to (0,4): Watcher dist=|2-0|+|3-4|=3; Ghost dist=|3-0|+|3-4|=4. Move to (1,4): Ghost dist=3, out of range. Seems like escaping Watcher adjacency puts Ghost out of range. Best option: stay at (1,3) — Watcher is at dist=1 (adjacent), so precision_shot on Ghost is BLOCKED. Use suppressing_fire on Watcher (adjacent, dist=1, within range ≤2) to deal damage and slow. Or use basic attack on Watcher since adjacent. Actually suppressing_fire deals 1dmg in a 2-tile line — I should check direction. Watcher at (2,3), I'm at (1,3), so Watcher is E of me. Suppressing_fire in E direction from Watcher would hit (2,3) and (3,3) — Ghost is at (3,3)! That hits both Watcher and potentially Ghost. Wait, suppressing_fire: '1dmg 2-tile line from target, range:≤2 tiles'. Target Watcher at (2,3), line extends E hitting (3,3) where Ghost is — wounded Ghost takes 1dmg, possibly finishing it. This is the best play: suppressing_fire targeting Watcher, dealing 1dmg to Watcher and 1dmg to Ghost (potentially killing wounded Ghost).",
