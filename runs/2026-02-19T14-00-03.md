## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Grid** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
### Opponent
- **Doc** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Viper** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemy lines. Doc at (2,4) is the priority target (medic, behind tile at (2,5)). Move north to close distance while cloaked.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is in scan range at dist 3. Scan to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. No movement needed — current position is safe and optimal.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5-6, my range is 3). I need to close distance. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer while staying safe. From there enemies are still out of range at dist 4-5. Best I can do is advance toward Insight at (2,1) — moving to (1,3) then waiting. Still no shot this round.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Bolt is my frontliner at (1,3) and the enemies are approaching from the south. I should move closer to Bolt to be ready to patch or overclock next turn. Moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Bolt, enabling overclock or patch as needed. No ability targets available this turn.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far away. Bolt is at (1,3) moving south toward us, Doc at (1,4). They'll likely move through the center corridor. I should advance and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer and lets me place a trap at (1,2) or (2,3) — tiles Bolt would pass through coming south. I'll move to (2,2) then place a trap at (1,2) which is on the likely path between Bolt's current position and our side.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far. Grid(vector) at (2,2) dist=5, Insight(oracle) at (2,1) dist=6. My orders say trap paths enemies must take to reach backline. Allies Bolt and Doc are at (1,3) and (1,4) — enemies will likely push through the middle. I should move toward center-right to control approach paths, then place a trap on a likely enemy corridor. Moving to (3,4) gives me good position. Then trap (3,3) — a natural chokepoint enemies crossing from left side will pass through.
  State: Veil 5/5, Grid 6/6, Insight 9/9, Bolt 4/4, Viper 6/6, Doc 8/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(1,3) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is the frontliner Doc is trying to keep alive — highest priority scan target. Already know Doc's prompt. Viper at dist=4 is scan range but is a vector (denial range adjacent, not blocking from here). Scan Bolt at (1,3) dist=3 to reveal prompt and deal 1 damage. Then move to (2,3) to stay at range while maintaining scan options next turn. Avoid (1,2) trap.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Bolt is adjacent but facing S, not behind. Doc is at (1,4) facing W — I can reach (2,4) which is behind Doc. Moving there sets up a breach next turn. Avoid the trap at (1,2). Move to (2,4) to get behind Doc, then shadow_strike or breach next turn.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Insight(oracle) is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first to use precision_shot. Moving to (0,3) keeps distance from both enemies. From (0,3), Insight is at dist=2 and Grid at dist=3 — both in range, no adjacency. Insight is closer priority target. Fire precision_shot on Insight.
- **Doc** (medic): move(0,4) ✓ → patch(0,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded at (0,3) with 3/4 HP, needs healing. I'm at (1,4). I need to get adjacent to Bolt to use patch. Moving to (0,4) puts me adjacent to Bolt at (0,3). Then I can patch Bolt. Grid is 3 tiles away so no ability blocking concern.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,4) ✗ Position occupied → pulse(2,4) ✓
  💭 There's already a trap at (3,3) blocking the path south. Insight is at (2,3) within range 2 — I can use pulse from (3,4) to hit Insight at dist 1 if I move to (2,4) or (3,3). Wait — pulse hits ALL within 1 tile from my position. Insight is at (2,3), dist=2 from me at (3,4), so pulse won't reach. I could move to (3,3) but that's a trap tile — dangerous. Move to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Insight at (2,3) and within denial range — good for blocking Insight's scan. But Grid is at (2,2), dist from (2,4) would be 2, still safe. From (2,4) I can pulse hitting Insight at (2,3) which is 1 tile away. Grid at (2,2) is also 2 tiles from (2,4) so not in pulse range. Let me move to (2,4) then pulse targeting (2,3) to hit Insight. This also puts me in denial range of Insight blocking their scan ability.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. There's already a trap at (1,2). Enemies are approaching from the west/northwest. Bolt is at (0,3) moving west, likely to push east toward us. Viper is at (3,4). I should place a trap on a likely enemy approach path — (1,3) or (3,3) are good candidates. (3,3) would cover Viper's likely southward movement. I'll move to (3,2) to get closer to action and place a trap at (3,3) to intercept Viper.
  State: Veil 4/5, Grid 6/6, Insight 8/9, Bolt 4/4, Viper 6/6, Doc 8/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → breach(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper who has DENIAL active, blocking my abilities. Cloak has 1 turn remaining — I need to move away from Viper's denial zone first, then use breach or shadow_strike. Moving to (3,5) puts me behind Viper and adjacent, but I'm still in denial range. Instead, I should move away from Viper entirely. Doc is behind me at (0,4) facing W — I'm already behind Doc. If I move to (1,4) I'll be adjacent to Doc from behind AND away from Viper's denial. Then I can breach Doc to neutralize the healer. Wait — denial is based on adjacency. If I move first to (1,4), I'm no longer adjacent to Viper, so my ability should work. Move to (1,4) then breach Doc.
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Bolt and Doc are already scanned. Viper is unscanned and in range at dist=2. I need to scan Viper to reveal their prompt. However, Viper is at (3,4) which is 2 tiles away — not adjacent, so scan should work. After scanning, I should move away to maintain distance. Current position (2,3) has trap at (3,3) nearby. Viper tried to move to (2,4) last turn but failed — they may try again. I should scan Viper first, then move to a safer position. Moving to (2,5) keeps distance from Viper and avoids traps.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are healthy, so I should target the nearest enemy. Orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded, but there's no enemy medic visible. Veil is closest at dist=2. I'm at (0,3), not adjacent to any enemy (Veil is at dist=2). I can use precision_shot since I haven't moved and no adjacent enemies. All three enemies are in range. I'll fire precision_shot at Veil (closest, dist=2) for 2 damage. No need to move - stay at current position to maintain range.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the back line. Allies are at (0,3) and (3,4). Valid moves: (0,2), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,4). Moving to (2,4) takes me away from Bolt at (0,3) and toward the center/back. Then move to (2,4) first, then I can't move again. Actually I should pick the best single destination. (2,4) moves me away from the cluster at (0,3)/(0,4). I could also go (0,5) to hug the top edge away from allies. Orders say away from team and toward back line — (2,4) moves toward center. I'll move to (2,4) as first action, then wait.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(2,3) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Viper is 2 tiles away at (3,4) — I must not move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. There's already a trap at (3,3) which is between me and Viper, good. I should place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to move through. Doc is at (2,4) and Bolt at (0,3) — they may advance through (2,3) or (4,3). I can place a trap at (4,3) to catch enemies flanking right, or (2,3) to catch Doc advancing. Since I'm at (3,2), I can place a trap within range 2. (2,3) is a likely Doc approach path. I'll place trap at (2,3) then move to (4,2) to maintain distance from Viper and control more territory.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(1,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded at dist=2, Insight is healthy at dist=2. I have a trap at (3,3) already. I can attack Veil to finish them off since they're wounded. Then move to (4,4) to maintain medium range and stay away from Grid's denial zone. Pulse would hit both Veil and Insight if they're clustered but they're not adjacent to each other. Attack Veil (dist=2, within range) first, then reposition.
  State: Veil 2/5, Grid 6/6, Insight 8/9, Bolt 4/4, Viper 5/6, Doc 8/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → recalibrate(1,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is right next to me at (2,4), distance 1 — adjacent. I should scan Doc to deal 1 damage... wait, scan requires range ≤4 AND target must not be blocked by adjacent Vector. Viper is at (4,4), 3 tiles away, not adjacent to me, so scan is not blocked. Doc is at distance 1 (adjacent), within scan range. But I should prioritize — Doc is already scanned. All enemies are already scanned. I should focus on dealing damage. Doc is adjacent (dist 1) so I can attack for 1 dmg. Veil is wounded at (1,4) and was targeted by Bolt's precision_shot and Viper attacked — Veil may be in danger. I can recalibrate Veil if I move adjacent. Veil is at (1,4), I'm at (2,5). Move to (1,5) gets me adjacent to Veil at (1,4) for recalibrate. From (1,5), Viper is at (4,4) = dist 3+1=4, still safe. Let me move to (1,5) first, then recalibrate Veil to help the wounded specter survive. This is better than attacking Doc for 1 dmg.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(2,4) ✓ → move(0,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with 2HP, cloaked. Breach is on cooldown. Doc is adjacent at (2,4) and I'm already behind them (Doc faces E, I'm at (1,4) which is behind). I can't breach due to cooldown. Shadow_strike hits adjacent and keeps cloak — perfect. But I have only 2HP and Bolt is targeting me. I should shadow_strike Doc first (1 damage, keep cloak), then move away from danger. Actually, I'm already in position behind Doc. Shadow_strike Doc at (2,4) to keep cloak and deal damage, then move to safety away from Bolt's precision_shot. Moving to (0,5) or (1,3) would take me away. Actually (1,3) is behind Bolt and adjacent — risky. Move to (0,5) to stay mobile and out of Bolt's range after striking.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the back line. My allies are mostly in the left/bottom area. Moving toward (3,5) then (3,4) gets me away from the team cluster and toward the back line. Note (3,3) is a trap, avoid it.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded and within range at distance 2. Priority is to secure the kill with precision_shot. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. I haven't moved, so full 2 damage applies. Stay at current position to maintain range.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Viper is 2 tiles away at (4,4) — I must not move adjacent or my trap ability gets blocked. I'm at (4,2). I can't place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Viper is at dist=2 so trapping is still allowed. Tile (3,3) already has a trap. I should place a trap on a likely enemy path. Enemies are approaching from the north/west. Tile (4,3) is between me and Viper — if Viper moves south it hits it. But moving to (4,3) would put me adjacent to Viper at (4,4). Better to trap (4,3) from current position (4,2) since trap range is ≤2 tiles and (4,3) is 1 tile away. Then move to (5,2) to reposition away from Viper while still covering the area.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 There's already a trap at (3,3). Grid is at (5,2) heading East, Insight at (1,5) heading West. I need to set traps on likely approach paths. Grid might push up toward our backline through (4,3) or (5,3). I should move to (5,3) to maintain pressure via Denial if Grid advances, or set a trap on (4,3) which is a likely corridor. Let me move to (4,5) to stay safe and trap (4,3) which blocks the central approach path toward our medic/striker.
  State: Grid 6/6, Insight 8/9, Bolt 4/4, Viper 5/6, Doc 6/9 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,5) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is the enemy medic at (3,5), distance 2 — already scanned. All enemies already scanned. I should use scan on Doc to deal 1 damage since it's the highest-value target (keeping medic pressured). Then move to maintain distance. Viper is at (4,5) distance 3 — I must not move adjacent to it. Current position (1,5). I can scan Doc at (3,5) for 1 damage, then move to (1,4) to reposition slightly. Actually, scan deals damage and I already know all prompts. Priority: damage the medic Doc with scan, then reposition.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight (oracle) is at dist=2, in range, healthy. No wounded enemies. Orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded - but there's no enemy medic visible. Insight is in range at dist=2, so I'll use precision_shot on it. I'm at (0,3), Insight is at (1,4) - dist=2, within range 3. I haven't moved, so full 2 damage. Grid is out of range at dist=6. Stay at current position to maximize range safety - I'm already at the edge. No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive gives +1 range (total 4). Precision_shot Insight.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the back line. My allies are at (0,3) and (4,5). I'm at (3,5). Valid moves include (5,5) which moves me away from Bolt at (0,3) and toward the east back line. Then I can move again — wait, I only get one move action. (5,5) is in valid moves and moves me away from both allies toward the back line corner.
- **Grid** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded at (5,5), only 3 tiles away. Viper is at (4,5) heading N — likely to move toward me or toward the center. I can't trap at (4,3) since it's already trapped. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Doc and closer to Viper — good position to threaten with pulse next turn if Viper closes in. From (5,4) I could pulse both Doc and Viper if they're adjacent. But first, let me place a trap on (4,4) to intercept Viper's likely northward path. I'll move to (5,3) first to get closer, then trap (4,4) which is between Viper's current pos and the center.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Traps at (3,3) and (4,3) already block direct approach. Grid is at (5,3) moving north toward our backline. Doc at (5,5) is wounded and needs protection. I should move to (5,4) to get between Grid and Doc, and place a trap on a path Grid might use. Wait — moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Grid at (5,3), which would block my own trap ability. Better to stay at medium range. Move to (4,4) to maintain distance from Grid while covering the approach corridor. Then place a trap at (5,4) to catch Grid if it advances north toward Doc.
  State: Grid 6/6, Insight 6/9, Bolt 4/4, Viper 3/6, Doc 5/9 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is targeting me with precision_shot this turn — I need to move to avoid taking damage. Doc is wounded but at distance 5, out of scan range. Viper is wounded at distance 3 and already scanned. I should move away from Bolt's line of fire while staying in a good position. Moving to (1,5) keeps distance from Bolt and Viper. Then I can scan Viper again for damage since it's wounded — actually all enemies are already scanned. I should use scan on Viper to deal 1 damage since it's already wounded and could finish it off, or just wait. Viper is at (4,4), distance 3 from (1,5) — within range 4. Let me move to (1,5) to dodge Bolt's shot, then scan Viper to deal 1 more damage to the wounded unit.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight (oracle) is in range at dist=3, healthy. No wounded enemies to finish off, so target the enemy medic — but Doc is the ally medic, not enemy. Between the two enemies, Insight is in range and Grid is out of range. Orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded — but there's no visible enemy medic. Insight is the only in-range enemy. I'm at (0,3), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Stay at current position (max range) and use precision_shot on Insight.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → patch(4,4) ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded at (4,4) with 2/6 HP and is 2 tiles away. I need to move adjacent to heal them. From (5,5), moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Viper at (4,4) — dist=1. However, (5,4) is a trap. Grid is at (5,3) so moving to (4,5) keeps me 2 away from Grid (safe, not adjacent). I'll move to (4,5) then patch Viper at (4,4).
- **Grid** (vector): trap(5,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Viper is at (4,4), 2 tiles away — adjacent would block my trap ability. I need to place traps on likely enemy movement paths. Tiles (4,3) and (5,4) are good candidates near Viper's likely movement. I can place a trap at (4,3) from current position (dist=2, valid) without moving adjacent to Viper. Then I can move to (5,2) to stay safe and maintain positioning. Actually, (4,3) already has a trap. Let me check: traps are at (1,2),(3,3),(2,3),(4,3). So (4,3) is already trapped. Viper at (4,4) moving south would hit (4,3) — good. I should place a trap at (5,4) to cover another escape route, or at (3,4) to block. Valid move tiles include (5,4). I can place trap at a nearby uncovered tile. From (5,3), I can trap tiles within 2 range. (5,4) is 1 tile away — good trap spot for Viper moving east. Place trap at (5,4), then move to (5,2) to stay away from Viper and maintain map control.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(5,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Traps at (3,3), (4,3), (5,4) already cover some paths. Grid is at (5,2) heading S, likely to advance toward our backline. I need to place a trap on a path Grid will take. (5,3) is between Grid and our position and not yet trapped. I can move to (3,4) to stay at medium range and avoid the existing trap at (4,3), then place a trap at (5,3) to catch Grid's advance. Wait — valid moves include (5,3) and (5,4) but (5,4) has a trap. I'll move to (3,4) first, then place trap at (5,3) which should be in range (dist from 3,4 to 5,3 = 2+1=3, need ≤2). Better: stay at (4,4) and place trap at (5,3) — dist = 1+2=... actually Chebyshev dist = max(|5-4|,|3-4|)=max(1,1)=1, so range 2 easily covers it. Grid moving S from (5,2) will step on (5,3). Place trap there now.
  State: Grid 6/6, Insight 4/9, Bolt 4/4, Viper 5/6, Doc 5/9 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(4,5) ✗ Cannot use scan — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with 4HP. Bolt will precision_shot me again next turn — I need to move to avoid being targeted. Doc is wounded and has a breached prompt (moving away from allies), so it's less of a threat. All three enemies are within scan range. I should scan Doc to deal damage since it's already wounded and could be finished off, or scan Viper. Actually, all prompts are already known. I should scan an enemy to deal 1 damage — Doc is wounded so 1 more damage could matter. I'll move to (3,5) to gain distance from Bolt while staying in range, then scan Doc at (4,5) for damage.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Grid at dist 6, Insight at dist 5). My range is 3 (plus 1 from High Ground passive if no adjacent enemies). I need to close distance. Insight is wounded so it's the priority target. Moving to (2,3) gets me to dist=3 from Insight at (3,5)? Let me check: from (2,3) to (3,5) = |3-2|+|5-3| = 1+2 = 3. That's within range 3 (or 4 with High Ground). I should move to (2,3) to get Insight in range, then use precision_shot on Insight (wounded oracle).
- **Doc** (medic): attack(3,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at 2HP - critically wounded and needs heal urgently. But Bolt is 4 tiles away, out of my reach this turn. Viper is wounded at 5/6HP, dist=2, also out of adjacent range. Insight (enemy oracle) is adjacent at dist=1 - my patch ability is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Insight is an oracle not a vector, so patch should still work. However, I only have 1 heal left and Bolt needs it more. I can't reach Bolt this turn. Insight is adjacent and wounded - I could attack them for 1 damage. Valid moves include (2,5) which would get me closer to Bolt. Let me move to (2,5) to get closer to Bolt for next turn healing, and attack Insight who is adjacent (wounded enemy).
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Insight is critical and adjacent at (3,5). I can pulse to hit Insight for 1dmg (likely finishing it) and potentially soften any nearby enemies. Then place a trap to control the approach path. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile of me — Insight at (3,5) is distance 1, so it gets hit. No allies are within 1 tile of me (Bolt at (2,3) is dist 2, Doc at (2,5) is dist 2). After pulsing, I'll move to (4,4) to maintain medium range and zone Grid's approach while staying off the trap at (4,3).
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2), no enemies in range. Viper is at (4,4) distance 3 — must not move adjacent. There's already a trap at (5,4). Enemies Bolt at (2,3) and Viper at (4,4) may push toward me. I should place a trap on a likely approach tile. (4,3) already has a trap. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to the action without being adjacent to Viper, and from there I can place a trap at (3,2) or (4,3) area. Actually I can place a trap from current position — trap range is ≤2 tiles. From (5,2) I can reach (3,2),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(5,0),(5,1),(5,3),(5,4) for traps. (4,3) already trapped. (3,2) is a likely Bolt approach path from (2,3). Place trap at (3,2). Then move to (4,2) to reposition slightly closer while staying safe from Viper.
  State: Grid 6/6, Insight 1/9, Bolt 2/4, Viper 5/6, Doc 5/9 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Last turn scan failed because Viper was adjacent blocking it. Doc is adjacent at (2,5) and attacked me last turn. Bolt shot me with precision_shot. I need to survive. Moving to (5,5) gets me away from Doc (adjacent) and Viper (2 tiles). From (5,5), Viper at (4,4) is still 2 tiles away — not adjacent, so scan won't be blocked. I could scan Viper or Bolt from there. But actually I should move first to escape, then scan. Bolt is wounded at dist 3, already scanned. Viper is healthy at dist 2, already scanned. Doc is wounded at dist 1, already scanned — all enemies already scanned. No new targets to scan. Grid ally is healthy. With 1HP I need to survive. Move to (5,5) to escape Doc's adjacency. Then wait or scan isn't needed since all are scanned. Actually I can recalibrate Grid who is at (4,2) — not adjacent to me at (5,5), that's dist >1. Can't recalibrate from range. Best play: move to (5,5) to escape immediate danger, then wait. Actually from (5,5) I could try to scan — but all enemies already scanned. Just survive.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (2,3) with 2/4 HP, wounded and needs heal. Distance is 2 so not adjacent yet. I need to move closer to Bolt to heal. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Bolt at (2,3). Then I can use my last patch to heal Bolt for 2HP, bringing them to 4/4. I have 1 heal remaining. Insight is at (5,5) critical but that's an enemy. Grid is far away. Priority: keep Bolt alive.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is critical but out of range at dist=5. Grid is healthy and in range at dist=3. Orders say to use precision_shot on most wounded enemy to secure kills, and if no one is wounded, target enemy medic. No medic visible, so target Grid. I'm at (2,3), Grid at (4,2), dist=3 which is within precision_shot range (≤3). I haven't moved yet so no 1dmg penalty — full 2dmg shot. Must not move adjacent to Grid (currently at dist=3, safe). Stay put and shoot.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(5,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is critical at (5,5) and within range 2 — attack to finish. Grid is at (4,2) also range 2 but healthy. Many traps already placed at (4,3),(5,3),(5,4),(3,3). After attacking Insight, I should stay put or reposition. Moving to (3,4) keeps distance from Grid and maintains denial pressure. Actually, I'm at (4,4) and Insight is at (5,5) dist=2 — use attack on Insight to eliminate. Then hold position.
- **Grid** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 4HP, Viper is at (4,4) distance 2 — adjacent would block my trap ability. Traps at (3,2),(4,3),(3,3) already placed. Bolt is at (2,3) moving east, likely heading toward (3,3) trap. Doc is at (2,4) wounded. I should move away from Viper to maintain trap ability, then place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (3,1) keeps distance from Viper. Enemies moving east/southeast might cross (3,2) already trapped. Place trap at (5,3) to cover eastern approach or (5,2) near my ally Insight's flank. Actually, Bolt moving east from (2,3) might reach (3,3) which is already trapped. I'll move to (5,2) to stay away from Viper and place a trap at (5,3) to cover Viper's likely southward movement path.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely vulnerable. Viper tried to attack me last turn and failed (not adjacent). Doc is wounded and at range 4 — I can scan Doc to deal 1 damage and potentially finish them off or weaken further. But Doc is already scanned. I should move to stay safe from Viper (currently at 4,4 — I need to avoid moving adjacent to them). Moving to (3,5) keeps distance from Viper and lets me scan Doc at range 4 (dist from 3,5 to 2,4 = 1+1=2, well in range). Actually Doc is already scanned. Bolt is out of range. I could scan Viper again? No — already scanned. I need to stay alive at 1HP. Best play: move away to increase distance from Viper, then wait or scan. Moving to (2,5) puts me 3 tiles from Viper (safe). From (2,5), Doc at (2,4) is distance 1 — I can attack Doc for 1 damage to finish them (attack is adjacent only). That would eliminate the enemy medic! Move to (2,5), then attack Doc at (2,4).
- **Doc** (medic): attack(2,5) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Insight is adjacent at (2,5) and critical — I can attack it. I'm at 4/9 HP but no healing options. Bolt is full HP, Viper is wounded but not adjacent. Grid is far away. Best play: attack Insight to finish it off while it's critical, then move away from it to avoid danger. I'll attack first then move south to put distance between me and any remaining threats.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,2), distance 4, which is within my range 3+1=4 (High Ground passive applies if no adjacent enemy, and there are no adjacent enemies). Grid is healthy, no wounded enemies or enemy medics visible. Orders say to target most wounded enemy; Grid is the only visible enemy. I should stay at max range and use precision_shot. My current position (2,3) is already at distance 4 from Grid. I have not moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'll wait in place and use precision_shot on Grid.
- **Grid** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with only 2HP, very vulnerable. Viper is 3 tiles away at (4,4) - I need to avoid getting adjacent to them or my abilities get blocked. Many traps already placed: (1,2),(3,3),(4,3),(5,4),(3,2),(5,3). I can't move to (4,3),(5,3),(5,4) as those have traps. Valid safe moves: (4,1),(4,2),(5,0),(5,1). Bolt is approaching from (2,3) heading east. I should place a trap on a tile Bolt might move through. Moving to (4,1) keeps distance from Viper at (4,4) - that's 3 tiles away still safe. Then I can trap (3,2) - wait, (3,2) already has a trap. Let me trap (4,2) or (3,1) - enemies moving east toward me might pass through (3,2) already trapped. I'll move to (4,1) to reposition safely away from Viper, then place a trap at (3,1) which is a likely path for Bolt moving east.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,1) moving south, wounded. I'm at (4,4). There are already traps at (4,3) and (3,3) blocking the direct path. Grid approaching from south would hit (4,3) trap. I should reinforce the trap coverage. Move to (3,5) to maintain distance and trap (4,4) my current position to deny that corridor, or place a trap on (4,2) to further block Grid's northward advance. Actually, traps at (4,3) and (5,3) already cover key paths. I'll move to (3,5) to stay at medium range and trap (4,4) to cover the square I'm leaving, creating a trap corridor.
