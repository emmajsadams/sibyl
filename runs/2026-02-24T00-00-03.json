Moving to (5,4) keeps distance from Watcher while making me harder to hit, then shoot. Actually, better to shoot first then move away from Bolt's position. Watcher is at dist 3 which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, range is ≤2 tiles). Dist=3 means out of precision_shot range (needs ≤2). So I cannot precision_shot from current position. Valid moves include (3,3) which would put me at dist=1 from Watcher - too close. (3,4) gives dist to Watcher of sqrt(1+1)≈1.4, adjacent diagonal. (4,3) is dist=2 from Watcher - in precision_shot range. Move to (4,3) then precision_shot Watcher. But (4,3) is in valid moves. However Bolt is at (5,3) - moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Bolt! That blocks precision_shot if Bolt is a Vector... Bolt is a striker not vector, so no blocking. But being adjacent to enemy Bolt is dangerous. Move to (3,4) instead - dist to Watcher becomes 1+1=2 diagonal... actually dist = |3-2|+|4-3|=1+1=2, in range for precision_shot! Then shoot wounded Watcher. This also moves away from Bolt at (5,3).",
