## Squads
### Player
- **Weaver** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
### Opponent
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,5) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are far (dist 5-7), no one adjacent so cloak is safe. After cloaking, advance south toward Deadeye (the priority target, enemy damage dealer) at (3,1). Moving to (2,2) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying central for flanking options next turn.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (3,1). Warden at (4,5) is dist 5, needs to get closer. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer while staying safe — dist to Warden becomes 3, which is within precision_shot range 3. No enemies adjacent so High Ground passive applies giving range 4. Let me move north to (3,3) to bring Warden into range.
- **Viper** (vector): move(0,3) ✓ → trap(0,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies far. Weaver is at (0,0) moving north toward me at (0,5). I should advance south to place a trap on the likely approach path. Moving to (0,3) puts me 3 tiles from Weaver and lets me trap (0,2) — the natural corridor between us. This blocks Weaver's advance and denies abilities if they step into it.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(0,1) ✓ → trap(0,2) ✓
  💭 Viper is at (0,3) moving south toward me. I need to place a trap in their path. Moving to (0,1) keeps me 2 tiles from Viper (safe from denial) and lets me place a trap at (0,2) — directly in Viper's path as they advance south.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) W ✓
  💭 Deadeye is nearest at distance 3, to my southwest at (3,3). I should advance toward them. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying within my move range of 2. No enemies adjacent so no attack. After moving, use shield_wall facing West/South where enemies are clustered.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✗ Position occupied → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 5, out of range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move to (2,2) to advance toward enemy cluster. Then use shield_wall facing North to protect allies Deadeye and Weaver as we push up.
  State: Bulwark 10/10, Deadeye 4/4, Weaver 6/6, Viper 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Warden 9/10

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is the priority target (enemy damage dealer) and I can get behind them at (3,2) which is adjacent and in my behind-tiles list. From there I can breach them. Move to (3,2) to get behind Deadeye, then breach — this forces Deadeye to obey me next turn, neutralizing their damage output while I stay cloaked.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge. Allies are at (2,0) and (0,1), so moving toward higher x or y edges makes sense. From (3,3), valid moves include (5,3) which pushes toward the east edge and away from allies. That's the best map-edge move available.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,3) ✓ → shield_wall(5,3) E ✓
  💭 Deadeye is adjacent at (5,3). Orders say attack if enemy is adjacent. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction which is good. Attack Deadeye first, then use shield_wall facing East where Deadeye is (and enemies are concentrated to my east).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 I need to push forward aggressively toward the enemy cluster. Wraith is closest at dist 3, at (3,2). Moving to (2,2) gets me closer while staying reachable. Then shield_wall facing N or E toward the enemy cluster. Viper is at (0,3) to my north, Wraith at (3,2) to my northeast. I'll move to (2,2) to advance, then shield_wall facing N to protect against Viper's approach and cover Weaver at (0,1).
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (0,1), dist=2 — in my attack/trap range but not adjacent, so my abilities aren't blocked yet. There's already a trap at (0,2) between us. I should move away from Weaver to avoid denial, then place a trap to further control the column. Moving to (1,3) keeps distance from Weaver and opens up trap placement. I'll place a trap at (1,2) to block Bulwark's approach path toward my allies at (3,2) and (4,3).
- **Weaver** (vector): move(1,1) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 There's already a trap at (0,2). I need to control chokepoints. Viper is at (1,3) and approaching. I can move to (1,1) to get closer without triggering denial, then place a trap at (1,2) to block the path between Viper and our allies. This creates a trap corridor. Moving to (1,1) keeps me 2 tiles from Viper at (1,3) — safe from denial.
  State: Bulwark 10/10, Deadeye 3/4, Weaver 6/6, Viper 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Warden 9/10

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown (1 turn). Bulwark is adjacent at (2,2) facing N — I'm to the east, not behind. Behind tile is (2,1). I can move to (2,1) to get behind Bulwark, then shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked. Deadeye is the priority target but unreachable this turn. Setting up behind Bulwark is good positioning and deals damage.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward map edge. I'm at (5,3), allies are at (2,2) and (1,1). Map edge is to the east/south. Valid moves include (5,5) which is toward the corner/edge and away from allies. I should not attack. Move to (5,5) to reach the map edge corner, then wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(1,1) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (2,1) — pulse hits all within 1 tile. I'm at (1,1), Wraith is at (2,1) which is 1 tile away, so pulse from my position hits Wraith. Viper is at (1,3), dist=2, so pulse won't hit Viper. After pulsing Wraith, I should move away from the trap at (1,2) — (1,2) is a trap tile so I must avoid it. Valid moves include (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (3,1) etc. I should move to (3,1) to get distance from Wraith and away from traps at (0,2) and (1,2). But wait — trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector (Viper). I'm at (1,1), Viper at (1,3) = dist 2, not adjacent, so trap is available. However, Wraith is right next to me and dangerous. Pulse first to damage Wraith, then move to (3,1) to reposition and stay safe. (1,2) and (0,2) are traps — enemies stepping there take damage, good for zone control.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(2,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at dist=2, within my denial range. I have traps at (0,2) and (1,2) already placed. I should place a trap at (2,3) to threaten Bulwark's movement path, then pulse Bulwark for 1 damage since it's within 1 tile range (dist=2 is not adjacent, dist=1 needed for pulse). Wait - pulse hits within 1 tile, Bulwark is at dist=2 so not in pulse range. I should move closer to use pulse or just place a trap near Bulwark's path. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (2,2) enabling denial and pulse. But moving adjacent risks counterattack. Better: place trap at (2,3) from current position to block Bulwark's advance, then pulse if I move adjacent. Actually trap range is ≤2 tiles so (2,3) is reachable for trap from (1,3). Let me place trap at (2,3) to block Bulwark, then move to (0,3) to reposition safely.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) S ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (2,1) — attack it immediately. I'm fortified so I don't want to move and lose 50% damage reduction. Attack Wraith first, then shield_wall facing South to protect against Wraith's position and any follow-up. Staying put keeps Fortify active.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Nearest enemies are Bulwark @(2,2) and Weaver @(3,1) to the SW. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Move to (3,3) to close distance while avoiding trap at (2,3). From (3,3), most enemies (Bulwark and Weaver) are to the S/SW. Use shield_wall facing S to cover that direction.
  State: Bulwark 9/10, Deadeye 3/4, Weaver 6/6, Viper 6/6, Wraith 3/5, Warden 9/10

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(1,0) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver (denial zone) which blocks breach/cloak, but basic attack and movement still work. I'm already behind Weaver at (2,1) with Weaver facing E. I'm also behind Bulwark at (2,2) facing N. Weaver is the immediate threat with denial — killing it removes the block and frees my abilities. I can shadow_strike Weaver (adjacent, keeps cloak if I have it — but I'm not cloaked). Actually shadow_strike requires cloak to be active. I'll use regular attack on Weaver to eliminate the denial zone, then move away or attack Bulwark. Attack Weaver first (dist=1, adjacent), then attack Bulwark (also adjacent at dist=1) if I can reach after. Wait — I only get one ability per turn. Attack is an ability. So: attack Weaver (to remove denial and deal 1dmg), then move away from danger toward a better position. Or attack Weaver then attack isn't possible twice. I'll attack Weaver (1dmg) and move to (1,0) to reposition, staying away from Bulwark.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge. I'm at (5,5) which is already at the top-right corner. Valid moves include (5,3) and (5,4) which keep me on the east edge. Moving to (5,3) gets me further from allies at (2,2) and (3,1). No attack ordered.
- **Viper** (vector): move(0,4) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 Traps at (0,2), (1,2), (2,3) already cover south approach. Bulwark at (2,2) is closest threat at dist 3. Move to (1,3) to stay near chokepoint, then place trap at (2,3) is already covered. Better: move toward (1,4) or stay and trap a new tile. (0,4) or (1,4) would extend northern coverage. Move to (0,4) then trap (1,4) to cover northern flank and create a trap corridor blocking enemy advance from east.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is closest at dist 2, to my NE at (3,3). Orders say push forward and attack when possible. If I move to (3,2) I'll be adjacent to Warden at (3,3) and can attack. Moving forfeits Fortify bonus but attacking Warden is worth it. Avoid traps at (0,2) and (1,2). Move to (3,2) then attack Warden.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,1) ✓ → trap(2,0) ✓
  💭 Warden is at (3,3), dist 2, in range. I'm at (3,1). I can pulse to hit Warden (within 1 tile if I move to (3,2)), but Bulwark is also at (3,2) — friendly fire risk. Better to place a trap between enemy positions. Wraith is wounded at (1,0), moving south — traps at (2,1) or (2,0) could intercept. Viper is far at (0,4). Warden at (3,3) is the immediate threat. I can't trap adjacent to enemies (Warden is dist 2, not adjacent, so trap is allowed). Place trap at (3,2)... wait, Bulwark is there. Place trap at (2,2) to control the corridor. Or move to (4,2) and trap (4,2) area to protect Deadeye's flank. Actually, best play: move to (2,1) to intercept Wraith's path and place trap at (2,0) — cuts off wounded Wraith. Wraith is wounded and moving south from (1,0), so trapping (2,0) or (1,1) makes sense. Move to (2,1), trap at (2,0) to catch Wraith.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent to the south at (3,2). Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified so if I don't move I keep 50% damage reduction. I'll attack Bulwark, then use shield_wall facing south (toward Bulwark and Weaver cluster) to protect against incoming damage.
  State: Bulwark 8/10, Deadeye 3/4, Weaver 5/6, Viper 6/6, Wraith 3/5, Warden 8/10

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (1,0) with 3HP, not cloaked. Weaver is at (2,1) — a vector that blocks cloak/breach if adjacent. Bulwark is the sentinel priority for breach, reachable via (2,2) which is behind them. But Weaver at (2,1) is only 2 tiles away and blocks abilities. I need to avoid getting adjacent to Weaver. Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Weaver at (2,1) — that would block breach on Bulwark. Instead, I can move to (3,1) to get behind Weaver (Weaver faces W, so behind is E side at (3,1)), then breach Weaver to neutralize the denial blocker. (3,1) is reachable (dist=3 from (1,0): (1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)). From (3,1) I am adjacent to Weaver at (2,1) and behind them — breach is valid from behind. This eliminates the vector denial threat and wastes their turn. Breach cooldown is ready.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is wounded and in range at distance 4. Orders say to use precision_shot on most wounded enemy to secure kills. I'm at (5,3), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Wraith is at (3,1), distance 4 — within my range 3+1 (High Ground passive applies since no adjacent enemy). I haven't moved so full 2dmg. Fire on Wraith to finish them off.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical at dist=1 and Warden is healthy at dist=1. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and didn't move. Priority: finish off Wraith with attack, then shield_wall facing North to cover against Viper approaching from (0,4) direction, protecting Deadeye at (5,3). If I stay put I keep fortify bonus. Attack Wraith at (3,1) first, then shield_wall S to face Warden or N toward Viper cluster.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,4) facing N with full HP. All enemies are out of range (dist 5-6). I have traps at (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (1,4). Valid moves include (2,4) which pushes me east toward the action. I should advance and place a trap to control the approach corridor. Moving to (2,4) puts me closer to Weaver at (2,1) and Warden at (3,3). From (2,4) I can place a trap at (2,3) — wait, (2,3) already has a trap. I can place at (1,3) or (3,4) to block enemy advance. Let me move to (1,5) to maintain high ground and place a trap at (1,3) to block the corridor between enemies and allies. Actually moving to (2,4) is better — from there I can trap (2,2) to threaten Weaver's path north, or trap along the Warden's flank. I'll move to (2,4) then trap at (2,2) to block Weaver's advance toward Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2) — attack it. I'm already fortified so staying put keeps 50% damage reduction. Most enemies are to the south (Bulwark at (3,2)) and east (Deadeye at (5,3)), so shield_wall facing S covers Bulwark's direction. Attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall S to block incoming.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Traps at (0,2), (1,2), (2,0) already block some paths. Enemies Viper and Warden are at dist=3. I need to control the approach path between enemies and allies. Moving to (2,2) positions me closer while staying out of Viper's denial range (adjacent only). From (2,2) I can place a trap at (2,3) — directly between Warden@(3,3)/Viper@(2,4) and my allies. This creates a chokepoint on the enemy approach lane.
  State: Bulwark 7/10, Deadeye 3/4, Weaver 3/6, Viper 6/6, Warden 8/10 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are healthy, so I target Warden (sentinel) as the closer threat at dist=2. Warden is at (3,3), within precision_shot range of 3. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is valid. I should stay at max range and not move adjacent. Current position (5,3) is fine — Warden is at dist=2, not adjacent. Fire precision_shot on Warden for 2dmg. No need to move.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent to the south at (3,2). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified (50% DR) so staying put is valuable. Attack Bulwark first, then use shield_wall facing south where enemies are clustered.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) — attack it. I'm fortified so I want to stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. After attacking, use shield_wall facing North to block Warden's potential counterattack and protect Weaver at (2,2).
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,1) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 3HP, facing Viper at (2,4) dist=2 and Warden at (3,3) dist=2. Warden is wounded. I have a trap at (2,3) already blocking the path between me and Viper. My denial passive is only effective adjacent. I need to place traps to control chokepoints. Valid moves include (1,3) which would put me closer to Viper but risky at low HP. I can pulse from current position hitting Viper at dist=2? No, pulse is 1-tile AoE. Viper is 2 tiles away so pulse won't reach. I should place a trap at (3,1) to cut off southern approach, or attack Warden who is wounded at dist=2 (within range 2). Attack does 1dmg at adjacent only — Warden is dist=2 so attack won't work. Abilities: trap (range ≤2), pulse (1-tile AoE), attack (adjacent only). I can trap at (3,3) where Warden stands? No, trap goes on empty tile. Warden is at (3,3). I could trap (4,3) or (3,2) — but Bulwark is at (3,2). Let me trap (3,1) to create a choke, then consider moving. Actually I should move first to (1,3) to get better positioning away from trap at (2,3), then trap to block Viper's path. Wait — (2,3) already has a trap. Viper at (2,4) moving south would hit it. I'll move to (3,1) — wait, (3,1) is a valid move tile. From there I maintain distance from Viper and can place trap at (4,2) or similar. Actually staying at (2,2) and trapping (3,1) blocks the flank. Let me trap (3,1) first, then move to (1,3) to reposition away from danger while staying in denial range of threats.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Weaver (enemy vector) is at (1,3), dist 2 — wounded and in range. Trap at (1,4) already exists. I'm at (2,4). I can't trap adjacent to enemy Vector (Weaver is at dist 2, not adjacent). Move to (3,4) to increase distance from Weaver and maintain denial pressure on approach routes, then place trap at (2,3) — wait, (2,3) already has a trap. Check valid traps: existing traps at (0,2),(1,2),(2,3),(1,4). I should place trap at (3,3)... but Warden is there. Place at (3,5) or (4,4) to block Deadeye's approach. Move to (3,4) first — that's valid. Then trap at (3,3) is occupied by Warden. Trap at (4,4) from (3,4) would be dist 1, valid. That blocks Deadeye's approach from (5,3). Also consider pulse: Weaver at (1,3) is dist 2 from me now — not adjacent, so pulse won't hit. Best plan: move to (3,4), trap at (4,4) to block Deadeye corridor.
  State: Bulwark 6/10, Deadeye 3/4, Weaver 3/6, Viper 6/6, Warden 6/10 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 7 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and at dist=2, well within precision_shot range (≤3). I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to Viper so no blocking. Stay at (5,3) to keep max range, then use precision_shot on Warden to secure the kill.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent (3,3) and wounded — attack it. I'm fortified so I want to stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Warden first, then use shield_wall facing North to block damage from the Viper/Warden cluster above me.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and in range at (3,2). I can attack for damage. Trap at (4,4) is already placed. I should move to (4,3) to get closer to Deadeye's approach path and attack Bulwark — wait, from (3,4) Bulwark at (3,2) is distance 2, in range. I can attack now without moving. But I also want to place a trap to control the chokepoint. Trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy — Bulwark is at dist 2, so not adjacent, trap is usable. I'll place a trap at (4,3) to block Deadeye's path, then attack Bulwark to pressure the wounded sentinel.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2) — attack them. I'm fortified so I should stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. Deadeye is E at dist=2, Bulwark is S at dist=1, Weaver is W at dist=2. Most enemies are roughly south/east. Use shield_wall facing S to block Bulwark's direction after attacking.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 3HP, wounded. Warden is at (3,3) wounded and in range. Viper is at (3,4) healthy, 3 tiles away. I need to stay away from Viper to avoid denial blocking my abilities. Trap at (2,3) already exists. I can use pulse to hit Warden (dist=2, need to be within 1 tile). Moving to (2,3) would put me adjacent to Warden but that tile has a trap. Moving to (2,4) puts me 1 tile from Warden at (3,3) — wait, dist from (2,4) to (3,3) is 2, not 1. Pulse range is 1 tile AoE. To pulse Warden I need to be adjacent. Warden is at (3,3). Adjacent tiles: (2,3) has trap, (3,2) has Bulwark, (4,3), (3,4) has Viper. I can't safely get adjacent. Instead, place a trap to control approach. (2,4) is a valid move tile, and from there I could place a trap at (2,3) — but that already has one. Place trap at (1,4) from current position (within range 2) or move to (2,4) and trap somewhere useful. Actually I can place trap from current position. Let me trap (2,4) to block enemy movement corridor, then move to (0,3) to stay safe. Or move to (2,4) first then trap (3,4) near Viper — but (3,4) is occupied. Trap (2,2) from (2,4)? Let me just move to (2,4) to reposition, then place trap at (2,3) — already trapped. Place at (1,4) from current pos, then move to (0,4) to stay away from Viper. Best: place trap at (2,4) from current position (dist=2, valid empty tile), then move to (0,4) to safety.
  State: Bulwark 5/10, Deadeye 3/4, Weaver 3/6, Viper 6/6, Warden 4/10 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and only 2 tiles away — priority target for a kill. I'm at (5,3), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Warden at (3,3) is in range (dist=2, ≤3). I'll use precision_shot on Warden to try to finish them off. No need to move — current position keeps me at safe distance from Viper (dist=3, not adjacent). Staying put preserves High Ground passive if applicable.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded — attack to finish or pressure. I'm fortified with 50% DR so staying put maximizes defense. Attack Warden first, then shield_wall facing North to block Viper's threat vector from (3,4).
- **Weaver** (vector): move(1,5) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,4) with 3/6 HP, wounded. Enemies are out of range. There's already a trap at (2,4). I should position to control the approach and place a trap to block enemy advance. Moving to (1,4) keeps me away from Viper (stays at distance 2 from Viper at (3,4), safe). Then I can place a trap at (2,4)... wait, (2,4) already has a trap. I should place at (1,3) or another chokepoint. Moving to (0,5) gets me further from danger, then trap at (1,4) to block the corridor. Or move to (1,4) and trap at (2,3)... but (2,3) already has a trap too. Let me check: traps at (0,2),(1,2),(2,0),(2,3),(3,1),(2,4). Valid moves include (1,4). From (1,4), I could trap at (2,4) - already trapped. Or trap at (1,3) or (0,3). Actually I should place a trap on the path between enemies and allies. Allies: Bulwark@(3,2), Deadeye@(5,3). Enemies: Viper@(3,4), Warden@(3,3). Moving to (1,4) then trapping (2,4) - already trapped. Move to (1,5) to get safer, then trap at (1,4) or (2,4). From (1,5), trap range ≤2 means I can reach (1,3),(2,4),(0,3),(1,4) etc. Place trap at (1,4) to block the corridor - that's a good chokepoint between my position and the enemies.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and 2 tiles away — within attack range. Trap at (4,4) already exists. I need to pressure Bulwark while protecting Warden who is critical. Deadeye at (5,3) is a threat. I should attack Bulwark to soften them further, and consider positioning. Moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to Warden and closer to Bulwark, but Warden is already there. I can attack Bulwark from current position (dist=2, rng=2). Then place a trap to block Deadeye's approach path — (4,3) already has a trap. Place trap at (4,5) to block Deadeye's northern approach, or pulse Bulwark. Actually pulse hits all within 1 tile — Bulwark is 2 tiles away so pulse won't reach. Attack Bulwark directly, then place a trap between Deadeye and our position.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2) — attack them. I'm at 2HP so I should stay fortified (don't move) to keep 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark who is wounded and adjacent.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is critical and only 2 tiles away — precision_shot will likely finish them. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Stay at current position (5,3) to maintain range and avoid moving adjacent to Viper.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 At 3HP I need to be careful. No enemies in range from current position. I see traps already at (1,4) and (2,4) blocking some paths. I should move to (2,5) to get closer and then place a trap at (3,5) to block the northern corridor — this cuts off enemy movement toward our flank. Avoid (1,4) and (2,4) which are trapped.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Warden is critical and adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Warden to finish them off, then shield_wall North to block Viper from pushing through.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with full HP. Bulwark is at (3,2) wounded and in range 2 — I can attack for 1dmg. Weaver is at (2,5) wounded and in range 2 — also attackable. Trap at (4,4) and (4,3) and (4,5) already placed east. I should avoid moving adjacent to Weaver at (2,5) to keep my abilities unblocked. Tile (4,4) already has a trap. Pulse would hit units within 1 tile — no enemies are adjacent currently. Best play: attack Bulwark (wounded, finish it off or weaken further), then move to maintain positioning. Actually, I can't attack at range 2 — attack is adjacent only. So I need to use trap or pulse. Pulse hits all within 1 tile but no enemies adjacent. Trap on an empty tile in range ≤2 would be useful — but (4,4), (4,3), (4,5) already trapped. Let me check empty tiles in range for traps: (3,3) is valid move tile and in trap range. Placing trap at (3,3) would block Bulwark's path from (3,2). That's good zone control. Then I can move to (3,5) to stay away from Weaver and maintain distance.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is at (3,5), distance 4, healthy. I'm at (5,3) with 3/4 HP. Viper is within range (dist=4, my range is 3 base + 1 High Ground if no adjacent enemy = 4). No adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive applies giving me range 4. I can use precision_shot on Viper. I haven't moved so no damage penalty — full 2dmg. Orders say stay at max range and use precision_shot. Current position is good, no need to move.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(3,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, adjacent to wounded Weaver who has DENIAL active blocking my trap ability. I can't use trap here. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile — Weaver is at distance 1, so pulse would hit them. Pulse is a basic ability (not in DENIAL list), so it should work. After pulsing Weaver (wounded, so this may finish them), I should move away to safety. Moving to (4,5) gets me away from Weaver while staying on the board. Actually, let me pulse first then move away from danger.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 At 4HP with fortify active, I'm fragile. Viper is at (4,5), dist 4 — out of range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (4,3) closes distance to Viper (now dist 2) while keeping me in a strong position. After moving, fortify drops so I'll shield_wall facing N toward where Viper could approach from (4,5) is north of me if I'm at (4,3)... actually Viper is at (4,5) which is north. Shield_wall N to protect against incoming fire from Viper's direction.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 2HP — critical condition. Viper is at (4,5), 2 tiles away and wounded. I cannot place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Viper is 2 tiles away so I'm outside denial range. I should place a trap to block Viper's advance and protect myself. Tile (3,5) is between me and Viper — placing a trap there would catch Viper if they move west. Then I can move to (1,5) to increase distance and stay alive.
