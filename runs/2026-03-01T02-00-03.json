Move to (3,0) gets me to dist=1 from Deadeye at (4,0), then I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked... but I'm not cloaked. At 1HP I need to be careful. Moving to (3,0) puts me adjacent to Deadeye - I can shadow_strike to finish them off. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I had it, but attack would work too. Let me move to (3,0) and use attack on Deadeye at (4,0) - wait, attack range is adjacent only. (3,0) to (4,0) is dist=1, so adjacent. I can attack Deadeye. But at 1HP I risk dying if Deadeye retaliates. However Deadeye acts after me in order, so I act first. Kill Deadeye this turn.",
