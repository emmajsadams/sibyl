## Squads
### Player
- **Lattice** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Seer** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5-7, need ≤4). Closest is Longshot at (2,4) dist=5. I need to move closer. Best move is to (3,3) which reduces distance to Longshot to 3 tiles, bringing them in scan range. From (3,3) I can scan Longshot at (2,4).
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — use cloak immediately as instructed. Then move toward Seer (the enemy damage dealer at 3,3) to position for an assassination next turn. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer while staying cloaked.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is exactly at scan range (dist=4) from my current position. I should scan Seer now to reveal their strategy and deal 1 damage. After scanning, I can move to maintain positioning. Wraith is my damage dealer at (2,3) - I should recalibrate them if possible, but scan takes priority this turn. No enemies are adjacent so scan is not blocked.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is at (3,3), distance 2 from my position (2,4). That's within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. I should fire on Seer immediately for 2 damage. No need to move first — I have a clear shot from current position.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest enemy is Longshot at dist 6. I need to close distance while staying at max range (2 tiles). Moving to (5,3) gets me closer without going adjacent. Still out of range after moving, so I'll wait as second action.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range yet. Longshot is at (2,4) moving south toward our backline. I should move forward to control the middle ground and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (4,3) puts me closer to the action while staying safe. Then I'll place a trap at (3,3) — but wait, Seer is at (3,3). Place trap at (2,3) instead to intercept Longshot's likely advance path southward.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Lattice 7/7, Seer 2/6, Wraith 5/5, Longshot 4/5, Lens 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(0,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP so I need to be careful. Longshot already scanned and will target me with precision_shot (Foresight confirms this). Lens scanned me last turn too. I need to scan Lens to reveal their prompt since they're at exactly 4 tiles range. I should move first to reposition - moving to (3,4) keeps distance from Longshot while staying in scan range of Lens. Actually, checking valid moves: (3,4) is valid. But Wraith (enemy specter) was at (2,3) last turn - danger nearby. Let me move to (4,4) to get further from threats, then scan Lens at (0,4) - dist from (4,4) would be 4+0=4, still in range. Wait, (0,4) to (4,4) is dist=4, valid. Actually I should scan Lens first since I'm already in range at dist=4, then move away from Longshot.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Seer is wounded — priority target. I can't reach behind Hawk or Seer this turn, but I CAN reach behind Lattice at (4,2). However, my orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer (Hawk/striker). Lattice is a vector — breaching it would be useful to deny its denial zone. But Seer is wounded and high priority. I can't get behind Seer this turn (options empty). I can move to (4,2) to get behind Lattice for a breach next turn, OR move closer to Hawk. Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Lattice — but breach from behind should work. Wait, the caution says Lattice is 2 tiles away and abilities are blocked when adjacent to Lattice (vector denial). So if I move to (4,2) I'd be adjacent to Lattice and breach would be blocked. I need to approach Hawk without triggering Lattice's denial. Let me move toward Hawk while staying clear of Lattice. Move to (3,3) keeps distance from Lattice (dist=1 from 4,3 — still adjacent, blocked). Move to (3,2) — dist from Lattice(4,3) = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, still adjacent diagonally? Adjacent typically means 1 tile orthogonally. (3,2) to (4,3) is diagonal distance ~1.4, not adjacent orthogonally. I'll move to (3,3) to close on Hawk while staying cloaked. From (3,3) next turn I could potentially reach (5,2) behind Hawk if Hawk stays put.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is at dist=4, exactly in scan range and wounded. Foresight shows Seer will move to (3,3) next — but I act now while they're still at (4,4). Scan Seer again to deal 1 damage (potentially finishing wounded target). After scanning, I can move to maintain distance. Lattice is at (4,3) dist=5, not adjacent to me, so scan is not blocked. Wraith is cloaked at my current position per foresight — I should move after scanning to avoid crowding. Move to (1,4) to stay safe and maintain range for future turns.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (5,3). Both enemies are too far: Longshot at dist=4, Lens at dist=5, max range is 2. I need to move closer. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer but still dist=2 from Longshot at (2,4) — let me check: from (3,3) to (2,4) is sqrt(1+1)=1.41, so within range 2. That works. Move to (3,3) then use precision_shot on Longshot.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → suppressing_fire(3,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is at critical HP and only 2 tiles away — priority kill. I'm at 3/5 HP so staying put is fine. Precision shot Seer at (4,4) from current position (2,4) — dist=2, within range, and Lattice is at (4,3) which is 3 tiles away so not adjacent to me. No movement needed, shoot Seer first. Then use precision_shot or attack on Hawk at (3,3) dist=2 — but I only have one precision_shot. Use suppressing_fire on Hawk to slow them.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded at (2,4) moving south, Lens at (1,4). Both are west of me approaching. I should move west to cut off their advance and place a trap on a likely path. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to where Longshot might move, enabling Denial. Better to place a trap at (2,3) or (3,4) to block their southward push. Move to (3,4) first, then trap (2,4) or (2,3) to catch enemies moving south.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Lattice 7/7, Wraith 5/5, Longshot 3/5, Lens 5/6 | Dead: Seer

### Turn 3 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → recalibrate(2,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice is closer (dist 2) and is the bigger threat — blocks my scan if I get adjacent. Hawk is the priority scan target per orders. I'm at (1,4), Hawk is at (3,3) dist 3, well within scan range. Lattice at (3,4) dist 2 is also in range but I should scan Hawk first per orders. Foresight shows Lattice used trap on (2,3) last turn — that area may be dangerous. I should stay put and scan Hawk, then recalibrate Longshot (wounded striker at (2,4)) since Longshot is adjacent to me. Longshot is my damage dealer and is wounded — boosting them helps. Longshot is at (2,4), I'm at (1,4), that's adjacent.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Hawk is adjacent at (3,3) facing W, so I'm currently to their south — not behind them. Behind tiles are (4,3). I can move to (4,3) to get behind Hawk, then shadow_strike to deal 1dmg while staying cloaked. This keeps cloak active for potential breach next round. Lattice at (3,4) is nearby but I won't end adjacent to them.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (3,4), which blocks my precision_shot ability. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone first. Moving to (1,3) gets me away from Lattice while maintaining range 2 to Hawk at (3,3). From (1,3), I can use precision_shot on Hawk (wounded) — but I'll have moved so it deals 1dmg. Actually, let me move to (2,5) to break adjacency with Lattice, then check range to Hawk: dist from (2,5) to (3,3) = sqrt(1+4)~2.2 > 2, out of range. Better: move to (2,2) — dist to Hawk (3,3) = sqrt(1+1)~1.4 ≤ 2, in range, not adjacent to Lattice. But (2,3) is a trap tile. Move to (1,3) instead: dist to Hawk = sqrt(4+0)=2, in range, not adjacent to Lattice. From (1,3), precision_shot Hawk for 1dmg (moved penalty) — Hawk is wounded, this may finish or crit low. That's the best play.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 1HP, suppressed (movement reduced to 1). Wraith is adjacent at (4,3) — precision_shot is NOT available against adjacent enemies when a Vector is nearby... wait, the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not enemy in general. Wraith is at dist=1 (adjacent), but the block condition is adjacent to enemy Vector specifically. Longshot (striker) is wounded at (1,3) dist=2 — priority kill target per orders. I should use precision_shot on Longshot for 2dmg to secure the kill. Moving to (3,2) gets me away from Wraith but keeps range to Longshot at 2. However, (2,3) has a trap. Moving to (3,2) is safer. But I'm at 1HP — if I move first then shoot, precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). If I shoot first then move, I get full 2dmg on Longshot. Shoot Longshot first for 2dmg kill, then move to (3,2) to escape Wraith.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at (4,3) dist=2 and Lens is at (1,4) dist=2. Hawk is critical at (3,2). I need to protect Hawk. Wraith is the immediate threat to Hawk - it's a specter with shadow_strike capability. I'm at (3,4), Wraith at (4,3). I can use pulse to hit Wraith (within 1 tile if I move adjacent). If I move to (4,4), Wraith at (4,3) is 1 tile away - pulse hits all within 1 tile for 1dmg. Also my Denial passive would block Wraith's cloak/shadow_strike abilities since they'd be adjacent. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Wraith, activating Denial to block shadow_strike. Then pulse hits Wraith for 1dmg. This also keeps me at range of Lens. Better to move first then pulse.
  State: Hawk 1/5, Lattice 7/7, Wraith 4/5, Lens 5/6 | Dead: Seer, Longshot

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk is critical and my priority target. I'm currently adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone which blocks abilities. I need to escape denial and get to (3,3) which is behind Hawk (facing S) and adjacent to him. From (3,3) I can use shadow_strike to finish off the critical Hawk without breaking cloak. Move to (3,3) first, then shadow_strike Hawk at (3,2).
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (4,4), dist=3, in scan range. I should scan Lattice to reveal their strategy and deal 1 damage. My current position (1,4) keeps me safe from denial range. After scanning, I can recalibrate Wraith at (3,3) who is adjacent to me — wait, Wraith is at (3,3) and I'm at (1,4), that's 3 tiles away, not adjacent. Recalibrate requires adjacent. So second action should be move closer to Wraith for future recalibration, or just wait. I'll scan Lattice first, then move to (2,4) to stay safe and position for recalibrate next turn.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both Wraith and Lens are at distance 2. Pulse hits all within 1 tile but they're at dist 2 so no pulse value. I can trap a key approach tile. Wraith is at (3,3) moving W, Lens at (2,4) moving E toward me. The tile (3,4) is between me and Lens - a natural approach path. Place trap at (3,4) to catch Lens advancing. Then I can move to (5,4) to maintain range and deny adjacent threats.
  State: Lattice 6/7, Wraith 4/5, Lens 5/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Longshot

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(3,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice already scanned, prompt known. I should recalibrate Wraith to boost their damage effectiveness, then stay safe. Wraith is adjacent at (3,3). I'm at (2,4), Wraith is at (3,3) — that's diagonal, distance ~1.4, so adjacent. I can recalibrate Wraith, then move to maintain distance from Lattice. Moving to (1,4) keeps me further back and safe.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → breach(5,4) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Lattice is at (5,4) facing E, so (4,4) is directly behind it. I can move to (4,4) and then breach — I'm behind, adjacent, and breach cooldown is ready. This disables the vector threat entirely.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(5,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,4). I can pulse to hit it for 1dmg, and my Denial passive blocks its cloak ability. Then I should move away to (5,5) to avoid retaliation while staying in range. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - only Wraith is in range so no friendly fire risk.
  State: Lattice 6/7, Wraith 3/5, Lens 5/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Longshot

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,5) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Lattice is at (5,5) facing N, and (5,4) is directly behind them and adjacent — perfect breach position. I can move to (5,4) then breach Lattice to take control. This sets up a devastating turn where Lattice obeys me next turn. I'm already cloaked so moving won't break it, and breach from behind is the priority play here.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(5,4) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at distance 5, out of scan range (max 4). Wraith is at (5,4) wounded and needs recalibrate. I need to move closer to recalibrate Wraith — but Wraith is adjacent to Lattice (vector), so I must stay away from that cluster. I can move to (4,4) which is adjacent to Wraith at (5,4), allowing recalibrate. But (4,4) would put me close to Lattice at (5,5) — distance would be sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, so adjacent diagonally. Vectors block scan when adjacent, not recalibrate. Recalibrate range is adjacent only. From (4,4) Wraith at (5,4) is adjacent — I can recalibrate. Lattice at (5,5) is diagonally adjacent but I'm not using scan. Let me recalibrate Wraith to help them deal with Lattice, then wait. Moving to (4,4) first, then recalibrate Wraith at (5,4).
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(5,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (5,4) - wounded and within pulse range. Lens is at (4,4) - both enemies are clustered enough for pulse to hit both (within 1 tile of my position at 5,5: Wraith at dist 1, Lens at dist 2 - wait, pulse hits within 1 tile so only Wraith gets hit). Actually pulse hits all units within 1 tile: Wraith at (5,4) is dist 1, Lens at (4,4) is dist 2 so only Wraith. But Wraith is wounded - pulse could finish or weaken further. My Denial passive blocks Wraith's cloak if adjacent. Use pulse on self position to hit Wraith, then move to maintain Denial pressure while avoiding Lens. Move to (4,5) to maintain adjacency to Wraith (keeping Denial on both) and put Lens at dist 1 for Denial too.
  State: Lattice 6/7, Wraith 2/5, Lens 5/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Longshot

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → breach(4,5) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at (5,4) facing E, HP 2/5. Lattice (vector) is at (4,5) facing W — I'm already behind them. (5,5) is reachable, adjacent, and behind Lattice. I can move to (5,5) then breach Lattice — breach requires being behind enemy, which (5,5) satisfies. This would take control of Lattice next turn, neutralizing the vector's denial threat. Breach is ready and this is a perfect setup.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) which means my abilities are BLOCKED by Denial — I can only use basic attack or move. I need to escape this denial zone immediately. Moving to (3,4) gets me out of adjacency with Lattice at (4,5). Then I can use recalibrate on Wraith at (5,5) — wait, (5,5) is distance 2 from (3,4), recalibrate is adjacent only. Or scan Lattice from range. Actually from (3,4), Lattice is at distance 2 — scan would work and reveal/damage. But Wraith is at (5,5), distance sqrt(4+1)=~2.2 so not adjacent. Let me think: from (3,5), Lattice is at distance 2, Wraith at (5,5) is distance 2 — not adjacent for recalibrate. Best move: go to (3,4) to escape denial, then scan Lattice from safe range to deal damage.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(4,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (5,5) - wounded and dangerous. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Wraith at dist=1. After pulse, move away to break adjacency and deny their abilities. Lens is at range 2, healthy - not immediate threat. Pulse first to damage wounded Wraith, then reposition west to maintain denial zone and set up trap coverage.
  State: Lattice 5/7, Wraith 1/5, Lens 4/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Longshot

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at 1HP and cloaked. Lattice is 2 tiles away at (3,5) facing W, so I'm behind it. (4,5) is behind Lattice and adjacent to it. I can move to (4,5) which puts me adjacent behind Lattice, then use breach to take control of the vector — this neutralizes the denial threat and lets me use Lattice against itself. Breach doesn't break cloak. This is the ideal play at 1HP since I avoid taking damage.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (Denial zone) so scan is blocked. I can only use basic attack or move. I'm at critical-adjacent HP (4/6) and need to escape the Denial zone to restore ability use. Moving away from Lattice to (2,3) gets me distance while staying on the board. After moving, I'll be out of Denial range and can potentially scan next turn. Wraith is critical and struggling — I should prioritize repositioning to help next turn.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,5) and critical - my Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. I can pulse to hit Wraith for 1 damage (potentially finishing them if critical means low HP), then move away to avoid retaliation. Pulse hits all within 1 tile AoE from my position - Wraith at dist=1 will be hit. After pulse, move west to (2,5) to create distance and set up trap coverage for Lens approaching from (2,3).
  State: Lattice 5/7, Lens 3/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 9 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 3/6 HP. Lattice is at (2,5), 2 tiles away — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but 2 tiles away should be fine. However, I already have Lattice's prompt. I need to stay safe and avoid getting adjacent to Lattice (which would block my abilities). Wraith attempted breach last turn but failed due to Lattice's denial. I should move to maintain range and scan if there are other targets. No other enemies visible. I'll move to reposition away from Lattice while staying useful, then wait or scan. Actually, Lattice is at (2,5) and I'm at (2,3) — that's 2 tiles, not adjacent. I already scanned Lattice. No other enemies in range. I'll move to (1,3) to get slight lateral distance from Lattice's column, maintaining scan range for future turns.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (1,3), dist=3, wounded. I'm at (2,5). I should move closer to get in range, then trap a likely path. Moving to (2,3) puts me dist=2 from Lens and within range 2. But valid moves don't include (2,3)... wait, (2,3) is listed. From (2,3) I can use trap on (1,3) or adjacent tiles to cut off Lens. Actually, let me move to (2,3) and place a trap at (1,4) or (0,3) to block escape routes. Lens is wounded - priority is cutting off retreat. Move to (2,3), then trap at (1,4) to block the path between us.
  State: Lattice 5/7, Lens 3/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 10 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone, so abilities are blocked except basic attack. I need to move away first to escape denial, then I can use scan. Moving to (0,3) puts me at distance 2 from Lattice, outside denial. From there I could scan, but scan range is ≤4 and Lattice would still be in range. Let me move west to (0,3) first to escape denial, then scan Lattice — wait, I already know Lattice's prompt. Better to move to (0,4) or similar to reposition safely, then wait since no other targets exist.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(0,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Lens is wounded at (0,3) distance 2, in attack range. I can attack for 1dmg to potentially finish them. There's already a trap at (1,4). I should attack Lens first, then consider repositioning or placing another trap to control paths.
  State: Lattice 5/7, Lens 3/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone, so abilities are blocked except basic attack. I'm at 3HP which is critical. Foresight shows Lattice tried to attack me last turn but failed. I need to move away from Lattice to escape DENIAL and get back to scanning range. Moving to (0,5) puts me 3 tiles from Lattice, out of denial range. From there I could scan next turn. First priority: escape adjacency.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,5) ✓ → trap(0,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (0,5) wounded, dist=3. There's already a trap at (1,4). I should move closer to threaten Lens while placing another trap to control approach paths. Moving to (0,4) puts me adjacent to Lens's position column and lets me place a trap at (0,3) to block the southern escape. But (0,4) is adjacent to (1,4) trap which is fine since it's my trap. Actually, move to (1,5) to get closer to Lens at (0,5) - dist becomes 1, enabling pulse or attack next turn. Then place a trap at (0,4) to cut off Lens's southern retreat path.
  State: Lattice 5/7, Lens 3/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 12 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → scan(1,5) ✗ Cannot use scan — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone which blocks my scan ability. I need to escape this position immediately. My orders say never get adjacent to enemy vectors. I should move away to break adjacency, then scan Lattice if possible. Moving to (2,5) puts distance between us. From there I can scan Lattice (dist 2, within range 4) to fulfill my scan priority orders.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(1,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (2,5), wounded. I'm blocked from using trap due to adjacency to enemy. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile — Lens is at dist=1, so pulse will hit Lens for 1dmg. That should finish or heavily damage the wounded oracle. After pulsing, I can move to (3,5) to create distance and avoid being an easy target next round.
  State: Lattice 5/7, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 13 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → scan(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 2HP, adjacent to Lattice which blocks my scan. I need to escape the denial zone immediately. Moving away from Lattice is the priority. I can move to (1,4) or (0,5) to break adjacency. From (1,4) I'd be 2 tiles from Lattice, scan would work. Actually let me move to (0,4) to get maximum distance. After moving, I can try to scan Lattice from range if distance > 1. Moving to (0,4) puts me at distance ~3 from Lattice at (3,5), which is within scan range 4. Then I can scan.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (0,4) heading west, critical HP. There's already a trap at (1,4). I need to reposition and place another trap to cover approach paths. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer to range while keeping medium distance. Then I'll trap (1,5) or (2,3) to cover flanking routes. Actually, moving to (2,5) keeps elevation and I can trap (1,4)... wait, trap already at (1,4). I'll move to (2,4) to get within range 2, then trap (1,3) to cover southern approach. But Lens is at (0,4) at dist=4 from my current pos. From (2,4) dist would be 2 - that puts me in range. Let me move to (2,5) to stay safer and trap (1,4)... trap already there. I'll move to (2,4) and trap (1,3) to cover the path.
  State: Lattice 4/7, Lens 1/6 | Dead: Hawk, Seer, Wraith, Longshot

### Turn 14 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(0,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — survival is critical. Lattice is at (2,4), 2 tiles away. I must NOT move adjacent to it or scan gets blocked. I already know Lattice's prompt. I should scan Lattice again for damage (1dmg) to finish it off since it's wounded, while staying at range. Scan range is ≤4 tiles and Lattice is at dist 2 — valid. Then move away to safety. Actually, scan first from current position (0,4) targeting Lattice at (2,4), then move away to increase distance.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (0,1) moving south, dist=5. I have traps at (1,4) and (1,3) already placed. Lens heading south will likely pass through (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) area. I should move west to intercept at medium range and place a trap on the likely approach path. Moving to (1,5) keeps me back while I can trap (0,3) or (0,4) to cover Lens's northward approach. Actually, moving to (0,4) puts me on a trap - bad. Move to (2,3) and trap (1,2) to cover the corridor between existing traps.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — survival is critical. Lattice is at (2,3) wounded and within scan range (dist=4). Foresight shows Lattice will move to (2,3) then trap (1,2) — so (1,2) is dangerous. I need to scan Lattice to deal damage and finish it off if possible, but I must not get adjacent to it (scan would be blocked). Current position (0,1) keeps distance=4 which is exactly in scan range. I should scan Lattice now from here, then move away from (1,2) trap zone — move to (0,3) or (0,4) to increase distance and avoid the trap.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 2HP - critical condition. Lens is at (0,4) heading toward me. I have traps at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) already blocking the middle paths. Lens is to my west-northwest. I need to stay alive and keep denying Lens's abilities. Moving east to (3,3) increases distance and keeps me out of immediate danger. I can't trap since I'm likely adjacent to or near blocked zones. I'll reposition east to survive.

### Turn 16 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(0,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — survival is critical. Lattice is at (3,3), dist 4, wounded. Foresight shows Lattice waited last turn, so it may act aggressively next. I must NOT get adjacent to Lattice (denial blocks adjacent). Scan Lattice now while it's in range (dist=4, exactly at limit) to deal 1 damage and potentially finish it off if wounded means low HP. I go first in order. Stay at current position to keep range, scan Lattice.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical 1HP - survival is paramount. Lens is at (0,5) moving toward us. I have traps at (1,4),(1,3),(1,2) already covering the left corridor. Lens is at distance 5, moving speed 3, so could close fast. I should retreat east to safety while placing a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (4,3) gets me further from Lens. Then trap at (2,4) or (3,4) to cover northern approach routes.

### Turn 17 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - survival is critical. Lattice is at distance 6, out of scan range (max 4). No enemies in range. I need to stay alive and reposition. Moving to (2,4) keeps distance from Lattice while staying on the board. No valid ability targets, so I'll wait as second action.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Lens is at (2,4), dist 3, out of range. I need to survive. Moving closer risks entering trap zones at (3,4). I should move to (3,3) to get closer without stepping on the trap at (3,4), then place a trap on (3,4) to block Lens's approach path — but wait, (3,4) already has a trap. Move to (3,3) to close distance and place a trap on a path Lens must take. From (3,3), I can place trap at (2,3) or (3,4) — (3,4) already trapped. Place trap at (2,3) to cover another approach tile. This creates a trap corridor. At 1HP I cannot afford to take any hits.
