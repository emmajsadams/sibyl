## Squads
### Player
- **Weaver** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Shade** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
### Opponent
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → cloak(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Bulwark is closest at dist 3 to the north. I'll move toward (4,3) to close distance on Bulwark while staying ready to breach next turn, then cloak.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per standing orders and TIP. Both enemies are dist=5, out of range. Move south toward Weaver (the vector, priority target) while cloaked. Tile (1,1) gets me closer without exposing position.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(2,0) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist=5, need ≤4). I need to move closer to bring them into range. Moving to (2,2) reduces distance to Aegis at (2,0) to 2 and Weaver at (3,1) to ~2-3, putting both in scan range. I'll move toward the enemies to enable scanning next turn while staying behind allies. Veil is at (1,1) and Bulwark at (4,4) - moving to (2,2) keeps me near allies. After moving, I can attempt to scan Aegis at (2,0) which would be distance 2.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (2,2), distance 2 — within range. I can place a trap on a tile between Watcher and my backline to control approach paths. Moving to (4,1) keeps me at medium range from enemies while covering the center. Trap at (3,2) threatens the central approach corridor that both Watcher and Bulwark might use.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (2,2), only 2 tiles away. I can move to (2,1) to get adjacent and attack. This puts me between allies and the Watcher threat. Moving north toward Watcher, then attacking.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Advance toward enemies to hold the front line. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Weaver at (4,1) without being adjacent (which would trigger denial). From there I can shield_wall south to protect allies if needed, or attack next turn when Weaver approaches. Staying on the x=4 column keeps me between Weaver and my allies at (1,1) and (2,2).
  State: Shade 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Aegis 7/8, Veil 4/4, Bulwark 8/8, Watcher 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): breach(4,2) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Bulwark (sentinel) at (4,3) with them facing S. I have 1 turn of cloak left and breach is ready. Orders say to use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. I can breach Bulwark right now from my current position since I'm behind them and within range. After breaching, I'll want to reposition toward Watcher (the oracle/damage dealer priority). Actually, breach uses my ability slot. I can move first to stay positioned, but I'm already in the perfect breach position. Let me breach Bulwark now while cloaked - breach isn't broken by cloak according to rules... wait, 'cloak broken by attack/breach'. So breaching will break my cloak. But I have only 1 turn left anyway. Breach Bulwark to control them, then move toward Watcher at (2,2) - I can reach (2,3) which is behind Watcher for next turn.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,0) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. Priority target is Shade (enemy specter = damage dealer). Can't reach Shade this turn. Aegis is adjacent but breaching a sentinel is less valuable than assassinating Shade. However, I can move to (2,0) to get behind Aegis for a breach — this would neutralize the sentinel and open a path toward Shade. Alternatively, move toward Shade's flank. The behind-Aegis position (2,0) is reachable in 1 step, leaving movement budget for a breach. Let me breach Aegis from behind to break their defensive posture, then I'm positioned to advance on Shade next turn. Move to (2,0) then breach Aegis — Aegis faces N, so (2,0) is directly behind them.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Shade will move to (4,3) this turn, and Weaver will place a trap at (3,2). Aegis already scanned. Priority: scan Weaver to reveal its strategy (dist=3, within range). Then move away from Shade who is adjacent at (2,3) and Aegis at (2,1) — being adjacent to both enemies is dangerous. I should move first to (1,2) to create distance from Aegis and Shade, then scan Weaver at (4,1) from that position (dist=3+, need to check). Actually from (2,2), Weaver is at dist=3 which is in scan range. I should scan Weaver now before moving, since scan requires ≤4 tiles and Weaver is currently at dist=3. Also critical: Weaver is 3 tiles away, not adjacent, so scan is NOT blocked. Scan Weaver first, then move to (1,3) to reposition away from enemies and maintain range advantage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from Veil (at 2,0 south of me) and toward enemy backline. Bulwark is at (4,2) and Watcher at (1,3). Moving to (3,1) gets me away from Veil and closer to Bulwark. Then I can attack Bulwark if in range, but dist=3 so no. I'll move to (3,1) first, then (3,2) would be a trap. Valid moves include (3,1). From (3,1) I still can't reach Bulwark (dist still ~2). Let me move as far toward enemy backline as possible — (3,1) moves east and slightly toward Bulwark. No ability target in range after move. Will wait as second action.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally Weaver at (4,1). Weaver is adjacent at dist=1, already as close as possible. I'm fortified so staying put gives 50% damage reduction. Attack Weaver since it's in range and is an enemy with DENIAL active.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (4,2). I have a trap at (3,2) already. Bulwark is right next to me — I need to either attack or reposition. Moving to (5,1) gets me out of Bulwark's immediate threat range while staying at medium distance. Then I can place a trap at (4,2) to punish Bulwark if it advances, or at a chokepoint. Actually, Bulwark is at (4,2) — I can't trap an occupied tile. Better to place trap at (5,2) to cut off eastern approach, then move to (5,0) to maintain distance. Or: attack Bulwark first (it's adjacent, range:adjacent), then move away. Attack deals 1dmg. Let me attack Bulwark then move to (5,1) to create distance while staying in play.
  State: Shade 4/4, Weaver 7/9, Aegis 7/8, Veil 4/4, Bulwark 7/8, Watcher 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining so I can't breach this round. I'm cloaked (or should be repositioning). Weaver is the priority damage dealer. I can reach (4,1) which is behind Weaver — perfect setup for breach next turn when cooldown clears. Move to (4,1) to get behind Weaver and adjacent, then wait to preserve position for breach next round.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (2,3) - danger! Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not a vector, so scan should work. However, being adjacent to Shade is risky. I should move away first to maintain safe distance, then scan Shade. Moving to (0,3) puts me 2 tiles from Shade and keeps scan range (dist=2 ≤ 4). Alternatively move to (1,4) or (2,4) to get distance while still having scan range on Shade. Let me move to (0,3) to increase distance from Shade, then scan Shade from there (dist=2, within range 4).
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,3) ✓
  💭 Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining so I can't breach this turn. Watcher is closest at dist=2 and I'm already behind it (facing W, I'm at (2,3), behind tile is (1,3)). I can move to (1,3) to get adjacent and behind, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Priority target is Veil (enemy specter/damage dealer) but can't reach it this turn. Watcher is a valid target and shadow_strike won't break cloak.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,1) - my Denial passive blocks their cloak. Bulwark at (4,2) is range 2. I can pulse to hit both Veil and Bulwark (they're within 1 tile of me at (5,1) - wait, pulse hits within 1 tile AoE. Veil is at dist 1, Bulwark at dist 2 so Bulwark is NOT within 1 tile. Just Veil in pulse range. Better to attack Veil directly for 1 dmg, then move to (5,0) to create distance while staying in range to trap choke points. Actually, trap at (3,2) already placed. I should trap (4,0) or (5,0) to deny escape/approach routes. Let me attack Veil first (adjacent, 1dmg), then move to (5,0) to maintain pressure while staying safer.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally Veil at (4,1). Aegis is at (3,1) dist=2, so I should be careful. Moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Aegis and Weaver. Actually orders say move toward Veil at (4,1) — but Aegis is at (3,1) which is adjacent to (4,1). Moving to (4,1) would put me adjacent to Aegis. Valid moves include (4,0) which is adjacent to Veil and closer but also near Weaver at (5,0). Best option: move to (5,1) — close to Veil at (4,1), avoids being adjacent to Weaver at (5,0) since (5,1) is 1 tile from (5,0) which is adjacent... wait, (5,1) is adjacent to (5,0) so Weaver denial applies. Move to (4,3) or (5,2) instead. (5,2) is not adjacent to Weaver. That keeps me near Veil and away from Weaver denial. Actually let me move toward Veil: (4,1) is where Veil is. I can move to (4,0) which is adjacent to Veil but also adjacent to Weaver — denied. (5,1) is adjacent to Weaver — denied. (5,2) is 2 tiles from Weaver, safe. Move to (5,2), then wait to maintain fortify next turn.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from Veil and toward enemy backline. Veil is at (4,1) to my east. I need to move west/away while progressing toward enemy backline. Valid moves include (2,1) which puts distance from Veil. But 'toward enemy backline' — Watcher is at (0,3) far west, Bulwark at (5,2) east. If backline means Bulwark/rear, I should go toward (5,1) or (4,2) but those are closer to Veil. Moving to (2,1) retreats from Veil. Then I can wait or use ability. Since I'm moving, I lose Fortify. I'll move to (2,1) to increase distance from Veil (dist would be 3), and wait as second action to re-fortify next turn.
  State: Shade 3/4, Weaver 7/9, Aegis 7/8, Veil 3/4, Bulwark 7/8, Watcher 4/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) facing E with 3HP. Weaver(vector) is at (5,0) — a denial threat but I'm not adjacent yet. Aegis(sentinel) is at (2,1) facing W, and I can reach (3,1) which is behind them. Orders say use breach on sentinels to break defensive posture. I have breach ready and 1 use remaining. Moving to (3,1) puts me adjacent and behind Aegis — perfect for breach. After breach, Aegis will obey me next turn. This removes a defensive unit and doesn't trigger vector denial since I'm not moving adjacent to Weaver.
- **Shade** (specter): breach(0,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is adjacent at (0,3) and I'm already behind them. I can breach them to take control, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying effective. Breach is ready and I'm in the behind position at (1,3). This is a prime opportunity to neutralize the oracle.
- **Watcher** (oracle): attack(1,3) ✓ → move(0,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,3) with 3/6 HP. Shade is adjacent at (1,3) and just tried to shadow_strike me — dangerous. Foresight shows Shade moved to (1,3) and shadow_struck (0,3), meaning they hit me last turn. I need to escape Shade's range. Moving to (0,0) or far corner puts maximum distance. But orders say move away from allies and toward edge. My allies are Veil at (3,1) and Bulwark at (5,2). Moving toward the edge away from them means going toward (0,0) or (0,5). Shade is at (1,3) — if I move to (0,0) that's 3 tiles south, distance from Shade becomes sqrt(1+9)~3.2. I have scan blocked when adjacent to Vector — not relevant here. I should scan Shade since they're adjacent (range 1, within 4) — wait, already scanned. I could attack Shade for 1 dmg since adjacent, then move away. Let me attack first then move to maximize distance from Shade. Moving to (0,0) gets me to distance ~3.2 from Shade. (3,3) is valid but moves toward allies. Best: attack Shade (adjacent, 1dmg) then move to (0,0) to flee toward corner edge, away from allies at (3-5, 1-2).
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at distance 2 (range 2 for my abilities). I can attack or pulse Bulwark from current position. Pulse hits all within 1 tile but Bulwark is at dist 2, so attack is better. I should also consider trapping to control Veil's approach path. Move to (4,1) to get closer to Veil's path while staying out of Bulwark's immediate reach, then trap (3,1) area or attack Bulwark. Actually, Bulwark is at (5,2) and I'm at (5,0) - dist 2, within attack range. I'll attack Bulwark first, then move to (4,0) to set up trap coverage on Veil's likely path toward our backline.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and hold position, exposing flank. Allies are at (1,3) and (4,1). Moving to (2,0) puts distance from both allies. Veil is adjacent at (3,1) — I should attack first before moving, then reposition. Attack Veil, then move to (2,0) to separate from allies and hold. Moving will break Fortify next turn, but orders are to expose flank.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally Weaver at (4,1). I'm at (5,2). Valid moves include (4,2) and (5,1). Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Weaver at (4,1) — one tile away. But caution note says Weaver is a vector and being adjacent blocks abilities. Moving to (5,1) also gets adjacent to Weaver. Either way I'll be adjacent. I'll move to (4,2) to approach Weaver as ordered, then wait since I have no targets in range.
  State: Shade 2/4, Weaver 7/9, Aegis 7/8, Veil 2/4, Bulwark 7/8, Watcher 3/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(0,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 2HP, cloaked, facing W. Breach is exhausted. Watcher is wounded at (0,0) facing S — I can reach (0,1) which is behind them and adjacent. Moving there lets me shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Priority: eliminate the wounded Watcher.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,0) ✓ → attack(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) with 2HP, adjacent to Weaver (vector) whose denial zone blocks abilities except basic attack and movement. Breach is unavailable. I need to kill Weaver — I'm adjacent, so shadow_strike would keep cloak but denial blocks it. Basic attack works though. I should attack Weaver first (dist=1, adjacent), then reposition. Weaver is healthy so 1 attack won't kill, but it's the best I can do. Alternatively, move to (4,0) to get behind Weaver, then attack. Moving to (4,0) first gets me behind Weaver and still adjacent — then basic attack. Movement is not blocked by denial, only abilities. So: move to (4,0) to flank behind Weaver, then attack Weaver at (4,1).
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,0) ✓ → scan(2,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,0) with only 2HP — critical condition. Shade is adjacent at (0,1) and wounded, actively targeting me. Foresight shows Shade will breach (0,3) then shadow_strike (0,3) — so Shade is moving away from me this turn. Aegis is at (2,0), healthy. I need to scan Shade isn't useful (already known). My orders say move away from allies toward edge, but I must survive. Shade is moving north, so I can potentially escape. I'll move to (3,0) to get distance from Shade and toward the edge, isolating myself per orders. Then I can scan Aegis if in range — Aegis is at (2,0), dist 2 from (3,0) = 1 tile, so scan would work. But scan deals 1dmg and reveals — useful intel. Actually from (3,0), Aegis at (2,0) is distance 1, within scan range. I'll scan Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → attack(3,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and hold/expose flank. Allies are at (0,1) and (4,1). Moving to (1,1) keeps me near Shade. Better to move toward (3,1) — away from Shade, exposes my eastern flank, and I lose fortify but can still attack Watcher who is adjacent at (3,0).
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(4,1) ✓ → attack(4,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with Veil wounded at (4,0) dist=1 and Bulwark healthy at (4,2) dist=1 - both adjacent. Watcher is critical at (3,0) dist=2. My Denial passive is already blocking adjacent enemies from using key abilities. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - would hit both Veil and Bulwark for 1dmg each, potentially finishing wounded Veil. Then I can attack Veil directly to finish them off. Pulse at my position (4,1) hits radius 1: Veil(4,0), Bulwark(4,2) both within 1 tile. That's excellent value. After pulse, Veil should be dead or very low. Then attack to finish.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (4,1) and has DENIAL active blocking my abilities. I can still basic attack. Watcher is critical at (3,0) and needs protection. I'm fortified (50% DR). Attack Weaver with basic attack since it's adjacent and in range. Then shield_wall isn't usable due to denial zone, so I'll wait or reposition. Actually denial only blocks abilities — attack is basic. Use attack on Weaver, then stay fortified by not moving.
  State: Shade 2/4, Weaver 5/9, Aegis 5/8, Bulwark 6/8, Watcher 1/6 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,0) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at critical HP and I can reach behind them. Position (2,0) is behind Watcher (facing E, so west side). I can move there and use shadow_strike to finish them off while staying cloaked.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (4,1) and in denial zone blocking abilities. I can still basic attack. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Weaver to finish off the wounded vector, then wait to maintain fortify bonus.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and hold position, exposing my flank. Allies are at (2,0) and (4,1). Moving to (1,1) puts distance from both allies and keeps me isolated. Then wait to maintain fortify bonus for damage reduction.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(4,2) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (4,2) - my Denial passive is already suppressing their abilities. I'm at 4/9 HP so I should avoid taking hits. I can pulse to deal 1 damage to Bulwark since they're within 1 tile, then move away to (3,1) to break adjacency and avoid counterattack. Moving first then pulsing won't help since pulse range is 1 tile. Let me pulse first (hits Bulwark at dist=1), then move to (3,0) or (3,1) to create distance. Trap at (3,2) is already placed. Moving to (2,1) gets me further from Bulwark and closer to supporting Aegis.
  State: Shade 2/4, Weaver 4/9, Aegis 5/8, Bulwark 5/8 | Dead: Veil, Watcher

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,0) with 2HP, cloaked. Bulwark is at (4,2) dist=4, out of range. No breach available. I need to close distance while staying cloaked. Moving to (4,1) would put me adjacent to Bulwark at (4,2) for a shadow_strike. Valid moves include (4,1) which is within mv3 from (2,0): that's 2 right + 1 up = 3 tiles. Perfect. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction at (1,1). Bulwark is at (4,2), dist=4, out of range. Allies Shade and Weaver are at (4,1) and (3,1) - both wounded and to my east. I should advance to better protect them while maintaining fortify if possible. Moving to (2,1) keeps me between allies and Bulwark. If I don't move further, I can use shield_wall facing East to protect allies. Actually, moving to (2,1) then using shield_wall East protects Weaver at (3,1). But moving loses fortify. Since Bulwark is still far and I'm already fortified, I should stay put and shield_wall East to protect Weaver who is adjacent-ish - but shield_wall only works on adjacent allies. Weaver is at (3,1), not adjacent to me at (1,1). Let me move to (2,1) to get closer, losing fortify but enabling shield_wall on Weaver next turn, or move to (2,1) and shield_wall E toward Bulwark to protect Weaver at (3,1)... Weaver would need to be adjacent for shield_wall. Better: stay fortified, wait - I have no adjacent enemies and no adjacent allies to shield.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (4,1) — attack it while fortified. Stay in place to keep fortify bonus and 50% damage reduction. No move needed.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,1) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded at (4,2) and within range. There's already a trap at (3,2). I should use pulse to hit Bulwark from current position (dist=2, pulse range is 1 tile AoE) — wait, pulse only hits within 1 tile. Bulwark is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach. I can use attack (adjacent only) — also won't reach. Best option: move to (4,2) is not in valid moves. I can move to (3,2) but there's a trap there. Move to (4,0) gets me closer but not adjacent. Actually I should place a trap on a path Bulwark must traverse. Bulwark is at (4,2) moving W toward our backline. Moving to (3,3) would let me place a trap between Bulwark and escape routes. Or I could move to (5,1) to get adjacent to Bulwark at (4,2) — dist would be 1, enabling attack or pulse. Let me move to (5,1): dist to Bulwark (4,2) = 1+1=2, not adjacent. Actually (5,1) to (4,2): |5-4|+|1-2|=2, not adjacent for attack. Pulse hits within 1 tile — Chebyshev or Manhattan? If Manhattan ≤1 that's strictly adjacent. Move to (3,3): place trap somewhere useful. Or move closer — valid move (4,0): dist to Bulwark = |4-4|+|0-2|=2. I'll move to (5,1) and use trap at (4,2) to block Bulwark's path — wait, can't trap occupied tile. Trap at (5,2) to cut off Bulwark's eastern escape. Move to (5,1), then trap at (5,2).
  State: Shade 1/4, Weaver 4/9, Aegis 5/8, Bulwark 4/8 | Dead: Veil, Watcher

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. Bulwark is adjacent at (4,2) and wounded. I can shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked (if cloaked), but I'm not cloaked currently. With only 1HP, using shadow_strike is risky since it's just 1dmg melee. However Bulwark is wounded so finishing it off is priority. I'll shadow_strike Bulwark directly since it's adjacent — this deals 1dmg and keeps cloak if I have it. I'm not currently cloaked so I should just attack. Wait — shadow_strike keeps cloak but I need to check if I'm cloaked. The status shows no cloak indicator, so I'm visible. Best move: shadow_strike Bulwark at (4,2) for 1dmg. If it's wounded enough this could finish it. Then I can move to safety since I'm at 1HP.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(4,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at (4,2), wounded, dist=2 and in range. I have a trap at (5,2) already. I can attack Bulwark directly from current position (dist=2, range=2). My ally Shade is critical at (3,1) - need to protect. I should attack Bulwark to finish it off since it's wounded, then move to maintain positioning. Attack first, then move to (5,0) to avoid being adjacent to Bulwark if it survives.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,1) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/8 HP, fortified at (4,2). No enemies are adjacent so I can't attack. Shade is critical at (3,1) dist=2, Weaver wounded at (4,0) dist=2. I need to stay fortified (don't move) to keep 50% damage reduction since I'm low HP. I should use shield_wall to protect against incoming threats. Shade is to my SW at (3,1), Weaver is directly S at (4,0). Moving would break fortify and expose me. Best play: stay put, use shield_wall facing South to block Weaver or SW threats. Weaver is at (4,0) which is directly south - shield_wall S would protect against that. I'll wait as first action to preserve fortify and use shield_wall S.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,1) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is critical at (3,1) and needs protection. Bulwark is at (4,2), dist 3. If I move to (3,2) I'd be adjacent to Shade and between them and Bulwark, but (3,2) is a trap. Move to (3,0) puts me near Weaver. Best option: move to (3,2)... no, trap. Move to (4,1) closes distance to Bulwark (dist 1) and I can attack. But Shade is critical and needs shielding more. Move to (3,0) is safe and near allies. Actually, moving to (4,1) gets me adjacent to Bulwark at (4,2) — I can attack. That's aggressive but useful. Shade at (3,1) is W-facing and critical — shield_wall from me at (3,2) toward N would help but it's a trap tile. From (4,1) I can attack Bulwark at (4,2) and I'd be between enemies and Weaver. Let's move to (4,1) and attack Bulwark.
