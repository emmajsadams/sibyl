Actually, suppressing_fire on the enemy Warden or Phantom rushing me could slow them. Phantom is a specter/rusher threat. Use suppressing_fire targeting (1,3) to slow Phantom, then move to (3,3) to escape the pincer. Wait — suppressing_fire does 1dmg in a 2-tile line from target. If I target Phantom at (1,3), the line goes from there... I need to specify direction for suppressing_fire. Actually direction is only for shield_wall. Let me re-read: suppressing_fire hits a 2-tile line from target. Best: move to (3,3) first to escape adjacency, then precision_shot Marksman at (3,4) for 1dmg (reduced since I moved). Or fire suppressing_fire at Warden to slow it. Given orders say suppress rushers, fire suppressing_fire at Phantom (1,3) to slow it, then move to (3,3).",
