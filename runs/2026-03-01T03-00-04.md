## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Viper** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move north to begin closing distance toward enemies. Enemies are all 8-9 tiles away, so I need several turns to get into position. Moving to (0,3) advances me 3 tiles north while staying on the west flank, avoiding the enemy Vector's denial range.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(3,5) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then advance toward Longshot at (3,1) who is only 4 tiles away and the closer threat. Move to (3,2) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Longshot at dist=5, Viper at dist=7). My range is 2. I need to close distance. Moving to (5,2) gets me closer but still out of range. Best move is toward Longshot at (3,1) - moving to (3,4) reduces distance to 3, still out of range. Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist=3 from Longshot. No move gets me in range this turn. I'll advance toward Longshot while staying away from enemies. Moving to (3,4) brings me closest to Longshot (dist=3+2=... actually Manhattan: |3-3|+|4-1|=3, still out of range 2). All moves leave me out of range. I'll move to (4,3) to advance and wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (4,3), dist=3, in range for precision_shot. I'm facing N at (3,1). If I stay put and shoot first, I get full 2dmg (no move penalty). Viper is out of range. Orders say maintain distance — I'm already at dist=3 which is good. Shoot Deadeye first, then hold position or reposition. Moving first would trigger the 1dmg penalty on precision_shot. Best: shoot Deadeye now for 2dmg, then wait or minor reposition. I'll stay and fire, then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, both enemies out of range. Longshot at (3,1) is closer (dist=4). I need to move toward the middle and place a trap on a chokepoint between enemies and allies. Allies are at (4,3) and (3,2). Enemies approaching from south. Moving to (3,3) puts me in a good control position, then placing a trap at (3,2) or between enemy paths. Actually, ally Ghost is at (3,2) so can't trap there. Place trap at (3,1) is too far. Move to (4,2) to close distance, then trap at (3,1) — dist from (4,2) to (3,1) is 2, within trap range. That blocks Longshot's current position or forces them to move around it.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,0) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1: enemies at dist 4-5, out of range. I should advance and place a trap on a likely approach path. Viper (enemy vector) is at (4,2), Deadeye at (4,3). They'll likely push west/southwest. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer but exposed. Better to move to (2,1) or (2,2) and place a trap on (3,1) or (4,0) to block approach. I can reach (4,0) in one move (dist=4 from me, but valid moves show [4,0] is reachable). Place trap at (3,1) - a natural chokepoint between enemies and my backline. Move to (4,0) then trap (3,1).
  State: Viper 9/9, Veil 4/4, Longshot 5/5, Deadeye 5/5, Viper 9/9, Ghost 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak expires next turn. Enemies are at (4,3) and (4,2), both out of range. I need to advance toward them while cloaked. Move to (3,3) to close distance — it's the furthest east I can reach. That gets me to dist=1 from Deadeye at (4,3), adjacent, ready to shadow_strike next turn while still cloaked if possible. Wait as second action.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — must use it now. I'm at (3,2), Veil is at (3,3) facing E, behind tile is (2,3) which is reachable. Longshot is at (3,1) facing N, behind tile is (3,0) reachable. Breach on Veil (high-value specter) is tempting but I need to be adjacent AND behind. I can move to (2,3) to get behind Veil, then breach. That puts me behind Veil at dist 1 adjacent — breach requires being BEHIND and adjacent. Let me do: move to (2,3), then breach Veil. This disables their specter for a turn, which is extremely valuable since they act before me in order.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is at distance 1, which is adjacent — precision_shot is blocked at adjacent range and I should not be adjacent to enemies. I need to move away first. Moving to (5,3) puts me at distance 2 from Veil (3,3), which is within precision_shot range and not adjacent. Then I can fire precision_shot on Veil. Note: ally Viper is at (4,2) which is not adjacent to my new position (5,3). No enemies are wounded, so target the closest enemy which is Veil.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Viper(vector) at (4,2) is in range at dist=2 and is a denial threat blocking my precision_shot if adjacent. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers — Viper is a vector (denial unit), worth suppressing. I'm not adjacent so precision_shot is available. Ghost at (2,3) is also in range at dist=3. Priority: hit Viper with precision_shot (2dmg, dist=2, no movement penalty if I shoot first). Then I can stay put or reposition. If I move first I only deal 1dmg. So ability first, then consider moving away from Viper to maintain distance.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,1) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Viper is at (4,2), distance 2 — exactly in trap range. I can place a trap on a path tile to catch Viper or any advancing enemy. Moving to (5,1) keeps me safe from Viper's denial (stays non-adjacent) and gives me a better angle. From current position (4,0), I can place a trap at (4,1) which is directly between me and Viper — enemies pushing south will hit it. I'll trap (4,1) first, then move to (5,1) to maintain distance and line up future pulse or attack options.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,1) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Viper is at (5,1) dist=2, Veil at (3,3) dist=2. I'm at (4,2). Viper blocks trap if adjacent, but dist=2 means I can still trap. Place trap at (4,1) between Viper and my position to catch movement. Then move to (3,2) to stay out of Viper's adjacency while maintaining denial pressure and controlling the center. Ghost is at (2,3) so I want to avoid placing traps where allies move.
  State: Viper 9/9, Veil 3/4, Longshot 5/5, Deadeye 5/5, Viper 7/9, Ghost 4/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward ally Viper at (4,2) to protect them, then wait. Current position is (3,3). Target (4,2) is in valid moves list. Move there and wait.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Longshot is at (2,1) facing W — I can reach behind tile (3,1) in one move. Shadow_strike from adjacent while cloaked deals damage without breaking cloak. Move to (3,1) to get behind Longshot, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (3,1) — precision_shot is likely blocked or risky since Ghost is at dist=1. Viper vector is at dist=2 which is in range but I must avoid moving adjacent to my ally Viper at (5,1). Ghost specter at dist=1 is the immediate threat. I should move away first to create distance, then use precision_shot on Viper (vector, high-value denial unit). Moving to (1,1) puts me at dist=2 from Ghost and dist=3 from enemy Viper. Actually, if I move first then shoot, I'll take a 1dmg penalty on precision_shot. Better to shoot Ghost first (dist=1, adjacent — but precision_shot requires LoS and is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... Ghost is specter not vector, so no block). Ghost is at dist=1 which is within range≤2. I'll use precision_shot on Ghost (2dmg, no move penalty), then move away to (1,1) to maintain distance from enemies.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with full HP. Both Viper(vector) at (5,1) and Veil(specter) at (4,2) are in range at dist=2. Neither is wounded, so orders say target the enemy medic — but neither is a medic. Both are healthy, so I'll prioritize Veil(specter) as the higher-threat target. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. I should not move adjacent to enemies. Staying at (5,3) keeps me at safe range. I'll use precision_shot on Veil at (4,2), then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded at (3,1) dist=2 and in range - pulse from current position (5,1) would only hit adjacents (range 1 tile AoE), too far. Deadeye is at (5,3) dist=2, also in range for attack. There's a trap at (4,1). I should attack Deadeye who is directly north at dist=2, within my range of 2. Viper is at (3,2) dist=3 so no denial threat. I can attack Deadeye at (5,3) for 1 dmg, then consider moving. Stay at medium range, avoid closing on Viper.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(3,2) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is critical and adjacent at (4,2) - pulse will hit them for 1 damage and likely finish them off. After pulsing, I can place a trap to control the approach from Viper at (5,1) through (4,1) area - but (4,1) already has a trap. Place trap at (4,3) to block routes, or move first. Actually, pulse now to kill Veil, then place a trap at (4,3) to control the corridor between Viper and our position.
  State: Viper 9/9, Longshot 4/5, Deadeye 5/5, Viper 7/9, Ghost 1/4 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → breach(1,1) ✓
  💭 At 1HP I need to eliminate a target fast. Longshot is reachable: move to (2,1) which is behind Longshot (facing W), then use breach to take control. This avoids the trap at (4,1) and keeps me away from enemy Viper's denial range. Breach cooldown is ready.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,1) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical and adjacent at (2,1) - I should finish it off. However, precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... but Ghost is a specter, not a Vector. My ally Viper(vector) is at (5,1) which is 4 tiles away, so no adjacency issue there. Enemy Viper(vector) is at (3,2), dist=3, not adjacent. So precision_shot should work. Ghost at dist=1 is in range for precision_shot (range ≤2). I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. Ghost is critical so likely 1-2HP remaining - 2dmg should finish it. I'll use precision_shot on Ghost first, then move away per orders toward (3,1) which avoids the trap at (4,1).
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Viper(vector) is at (5,1), distance 2 — in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. No enemies are wounded so I target the vector (no enemy medic present). I must not move adjacent to enemy Viper. Staying at (5,3) keeps distance=2, which is safe. Fire precision_shot at Viper, then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → pulse(5,2) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (5,3), distance 2 — in range for pulse if I stay put. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so from (5,1) it won't reach (5,3). But I can move to (5,2) to close the gap, then pulse would hit Deadeye at (5,3) since dist=1. However, (4,1) is a trap tile — avoid it. Moving to (5,2) puts me closer to Deadeye and enables pulse. After pulsing, I'll have applied pressure. Viper is at (3,2) dist=3, no immediate threat. Let me move to (5,2) then pulse Deadeye at (5,3).
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (3,1) - I can attack for 1dmg. Viper enemy is at (5,2), dist=2, so not adjacent (denial doesn't affect me). I should attack Longshot who is right next to me, then move north to (3,3) to get distance from Longshot while staying away from Viper. Alternatively, I could place a trap to control space. Traps already at (4,1) and (4,3). Moving to (3,3) then using pulse would hit Longshot at dist=1... but Longshot is at (3,1) which is 2 tiles away from (3,3). Better to attack Longshot now while adjacent, then reposition. Move to (2,2) to maintain distance from both enemies while staying in play.
  State: Viper 7/9, Longshot 3/5, Deadeye 4/5, Viper 7/9 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 5 — player
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Viper(vector) enemy at (2,2) is in range and 2 tiles away — I can use precision_shot for 2dmg since I haven't moved yet. Moving to (4,1) would hit the trap and is ordered, but shooting first while stationary preserves full precision_shot damage. I'll fire precision_shot at enemy Viper first, then move toward (4,1) as ordered.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(5,2) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Viper at (5,2) which is blocking my precision_shot. I need to move away first to escape the denial zone, then use precision_shot. Moving to (5,4) keeps me at range 2 from enemy Viper and avoids the trap at (4,3). From (5,4), enemy Viper at (5,2) is dist=2, in range for precision_shot. Longshot at (4,1) is dist=3, still out of range. Enemy Viper is healthy so I'll target them to whittle down.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=3, out of range. Deadeye is at (5,5) to my north - likely advancing down the column. Viper is at (2,2) to my west. Longshot is wounded at (4,1) with a trap there already. I should place a trap to intercept Deadeye's likely path south along column 5, then hold position at medium range. Moving to (5,3) gets me closer to Deadeye while staying at range 2, and I can trap (5,4) to block Deadeye's advance. Stay out of Viper's denial range (currently dist=3, safe).
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Longshot is wounded at (4,1) and there's already a trap at (4,3). I should advance toward the center to control more territory and place a trap on the likely approach path. Moving to (4,2) puts me closer to both enemies and within trap range of key tiles. From (4,2) I can place a trap at (4,1) directly on Longshot, or threaten Viper's approach. Let me move to (3,2) first to get closer without overextending, then place a trap at (4,2) to block the corridor between the two enemies.
  State: Viper 7/9, Longshot 2/5, Deadeye 4/5, Viper 5/9 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 2HP, currently standing on a trap. Enemy Viper is wounded at (3,2), dist=2, within range for precision_shot. I need to avoid the trap at (4,1) by moving, and I must not move adjacent to enemy Viper (which would block precision_shot). Moving to (5,1) gets me off the trap, avoids adjacency to enemy Viper, and keeps Viper in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved before shooting, so precision_shot does full 2dmg.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Viper(vector) is at (5,3), distance 2 — exactly at max range for precision_shot. Longshot is out of range at dist 4. Viper is healthy but is the only target in range. Orders say to stay at max range and use precision_shot. I'm already at (5,5) which is distance 2 from Viper — perfect range. I must not move adjacent (dist 1) to Viper. I haven't moved this turn so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. No need to move — fire first, then wait.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (5,5), dist=2 and in range. There's already a trap at (5,4) between us. I should avoid moving to (5,4) as that's a trap. Viper is at (3,2), dist=3, wounded. My ally Longshot is at (5,1) wounded. I need to protect the backline. Trap at (4,1) and (5,4) already placed. I can place a trap to control paths - (4,4) would block Deadeye's approach route. Or I can pulse Deadeye since they're within 1 tile if I move closer... but better to stay at range. I'll trap (4,4) to block Deadeye's movement options, staying at current position. Actually Deadeye is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach from here (pulse is range 1 AoE). Let me trap a key path tile. (4,4) is a valid move tile and I can trap from current position at (5,3) - (4,4) is within 2 tiles. That blocks Deadeye's approach. Stay put and trap.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are 3 tiles away. I have traps already at (4,3) and (4,2) covering that corridor. I should move closer to pressure Viper while staying outside denial range (not adjacent). Moving to (4,1) would be 2 tiles from both enemies and let me place a trap at (5,2) to funnel Longshot, but (4,2) already has a trap. I can move to (3,1) and place a trap at (4,1) to extend trap coverage southward, cutting off Longshot's escape routes. Or move to (4,1) — dist to Viper@(5,3) would be sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, not adjacent, safe. From (4,1) I could trap (5,2) to box in Longshot. Let me move to (4,1) and trap (5,2) — this creates a trap cluster around both wounded enemies.
  State: Viper 5/9, Longshot 2/5, Deadeye 4/5, Viper 4/9 | Dead: Veil, Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Viper(vector) is at (5,3), dist=2, wounded. I'm at (5,5), not adjacent. precision_shot is valid at range ≤2 with LoS, and I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. Fire on wounded Viper to secure the kill. No need to move — already at max range and safe distance.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → attack(4,1) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Viper at (4,1) which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first to escape the denial zone, then attack. Moving to (5,2) increases distance from Viper while keeping me on the board. From (5,2), Viper at (4,1) is dist=sqrt(2)~1.4, still adjacent diagonally — denial may still apply. Better to move to (3,1) to get dist=1 from Viper laterally but that's still adjacent. Actually, valid moves show (5,0) or (4,2) or (3,1). Moving to (3,1) puts me at dist=1 from Viper still. I can only escape adjacency if I move 2 tiles away. (5,0) is dist=sqrt(2) from Viper — diagonal, still adjacent. (4,2) is dist=sqrt(2) from Viper — diagonal, still adjacent. (4,0) is dist=1 from Viper — adjacent. None of the valid moves fully escape adjacency to Viper. Best option: move to (5,2) to maximize distance from enemy Viper (diagonal), then use basic attack on the adjacent Viper since precision_shot is blocked. Actually (5,2) isn't in valid moves list. Valid: [3,1],[4,0],[4,2],[5,0],[5,2] — (5,2) IS listed. Move to (5,2), then basic attack Viper at (4,1) since precision_shot blocked.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,1) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critical and within range 2 — I can attack it. But there are traps at (4,2) and (4,3) blocking my path north. I'm at (4,1). I can attack Longshot at (5,2) from current position since dist=2 and my range is 2. Then I should consider moving or placing a trap. Actually, let me pulse first — Longshot is at dist=2, outside pulse range (1 tile AoE). Attack is range adjacent only. My attack range is adjacent (1 tile), but Longshot is at dist=2. Pulse hits within 1 tile. So I can't directly attack Longshot from here. I need to move closer. Valid moves include (5,1) which is adjacent to Longshot at (5,2) — but that's also closer to Viper at (5,3) dist would be 2, still not adjacent so denial won't apply. From (5,1) I could attack Longshot (adjacent). But wait — traps at (4,2) and (4,3). Moving to (5,1) avoids those. From (5,1), Longshot is at (5,2) — adjacent, I can attack. Viper would be at dist=2, not adjacent, so no denial issue. Let me move to (5,1) then attack Longshot to finish it off.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 3HP, flanked by Deadeye at (5,5) and Viper at (5,1) — both 2 tiles away. Traps already at (5,4) and (4,4). Deadeye is healthy and dangerous. I need to reposition to avoid getting sandwiched. Moving to (4,3) gets me off the column, maintains medium range to both enemies, and avoids stepping on traps. From (4,3) I can pulse if either closes in, or set a trap to cover the (5,3) corridor. Setting a trap at (5,2) would threaten Viper's path northward and add area denial.
  State: Viper 2/9, Deadeye 4/5, Viper 4/9 | Dead: Veil, Longshot, Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Cannot use precision_shot — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Enemy Viper(vector) is at (4,3) critical status, dist=3, in range. I'm at (5,5). Precision_shot has range ≤2 tiles, but dist=3 means it's OUT of range for precision_shot. I need to move closer. Moving to (5,3) puts me at dist=2 from (4,3) — that's within precision_shot range and not adjacent to the enemy. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot gets full 2dmg. That should finish a critical enemy.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/9 HP (wounded), Deadeye is adjacent at (5,3) dealing threat. I need to escape. Moving west to (3,3) puts distance between me and Deadeye. Valid moves include (3,3) and (3,4). From (3,3) I can place a trap at (4,3) - my current tile - to punish any pursuit. Deadeye is healthy and adjacent, so staying here means taking damage. Move to (3,3) first, then trap (4,3) to block the pursuit path.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Viper enemy is at (3,3), critical HP but dist=4 out of range. There's already a trap at (4,2). I need to move closer to threaten with denial and potentially pulse. Moving to (4,1) puts me closer and I can place a trap at (3,1) to block enemy approach path toward my ally Deadeye at (5,3). Valid moves include (4,1) and (3,1). Move to (4,1) first, then place trap at (3,1) to create a chokepoint between enemy Viper and our position.
