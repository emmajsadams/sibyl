## Squads
### Player
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then move north toward enemies. Shade is closest at dist 5. I'll advance toward (0,3) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, orders say to cloak. I'm at (1,4) facing S. Both enemies are at distance 5, out of range. I should cloak now to get invisibility for 3 turns, then move toward enemy lines. Moving to (1,1) gets me closer to Prophet at (3,1) while staying cloaked.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at dist=4, exactly in scan range. Scan reveals their prompt and deals 1dmg. Lifeline is out of range at dist=5. I should scan Hawk now, then move north to potentially bring Lifeline into range next turn while staying safe.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. I need to back away to use it effectively. Move to (5,4) to create distance, then precision_shot Prophet at dist=1 from new position — wait, that's still dist 1. Move to (5,5) puts distance at 2 from Prophet at (3,4) — actually dist = |5-3|+|5-4| = 3, out of range. Move to (4,5) gives dist=2 from Prophet, within range 2 and no longer adjacent. Then precision_shot Prophet (oracle = high value target).
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → patch(4,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded at HP 1/3 and is at (4,5), distance 2 from me at (2,5). I need to move adjacent to Hawk to heal him. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (4,5). Then I can use patch to heal Hawk for 2HP.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Advancing toward nearest enemy (Lifeline at 3,5, dist 6). Move to (2,2) to close distance. No allies adjacent for shield_wall. Wait as second action.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Ghost 4/4, Prophet 9/10, Shade 4/4, Hawk 3/3, Lifeline 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,5) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks scan per rules. But Lifeline is the medic healing Hawk — high priority target. I should scan Lifeline to reveal their prompt and deal damage. Wait — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not medic. Lifeline is a medic, not a Vector. So scan on Lifeline is valid. Scanning Lifeline (dist=1, within range 4) reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage. Then I should move away to maintain distance from enemies.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Aegis is at (2,2) facing N, and I can reach (2,1) which is behind them. Moving there puts me adjacent and behind for a breach next turn. Shadow_strike won't break cloak, so I can attack from stealth. Let me move to (2,1) to get behind Aegis, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked at (0,3) facing N with 2 turns of cloak remaining. Lifeline is at (3,5) dist=5, Hawk at (4,5) dist=6. Neither is reachable this turn. I should close the gap toward Lifeline (the medic priority target). Best valid move is toward (3,3) then next turn push to (3,5) vicinity. Moving to (3,3) gets me 3 tiles closer to the action.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → overclock(4,5) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Hawk is adjacent at (4,5) and is my damage dealer (striker). I should move closer to the action and use overclock on Hawk to boost their damage output. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (4,5) and closer to enemies.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (4,5). Closest enemy is Prophet at dist=4, Aegis at dist=5. I need to close distance to get Prophet in range (dist≤2). Moving to (3,4) reduces distance to Prophet from 4 to 2, bringing them into precision_shot range. I'm overclocked so I get 2 ability uses. After moving to (3,4), Prophet at (2,3) would be dist=2, in range. I'll use precision_shot on Prophet (medic-tier value as oracle). Since I moved, precision_shot does 1dmg. Second ability use: suppressing_fire on Prophet to slow them.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy (Hawk at 3,4, dist=3) and use shield_wall facing the direction with most enemies. Enemies are to the N/NE. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Hawk (dist=2) while staying near allies Ghost(3,3) and Prophet(2,3). From (3,2), I can shield_wall facing N toward the enemies clustered at (3,4) and (4,4). This protects my allies and follows orders.
  State: Aegis 11/12, Ghost 4/4, Prophet 8/10, Shade 4/4, Hawk 2/3, Lifeline 7/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → scan(2,1) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Hawk will precision_shot me at (2,3) this turn — I need to move away. Shade is moving to (2,1) and shadow_striking (2,2), so I should avoid that area. Both enemies already scanned. I should move to safety and consider recalibrating Ghost or scanning Shade (cloaked specter not yet revealed). Moving to (1,4) gets me away from Hawk's shot and keeps me at range. From (1,4) I can scan Shade at (2,1)→dist=~2, within scan range.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → breach(4,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — must use it now. Lifeline (medic) is the high-value target. I can reach (4,5) which is directly behind Lifeline at (4,4) facing S. From there I can breach Lifeline next turn. Move to (4,5) first, then breach Lifeline from behind.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I'm at (2,1), behind Aegis at (3,2) facing E — tile (2,2) is adjacent, behind, and reachable. Move to (2,2) then shadow_strike Aegis to deal 1dmg while maintaining cloak. At 2HP I need to be cautious, but shadow_strike preserves cloak so this is safe.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (4,4). Valid moves include (5,5) which is toward the corner edge. I'll move to (5,5) to get away from combat and toward the map edge. No ability needed.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/3 HP with three enemies in range. Orders say medics first — no medic in range. Prophet (oracle) is high-value at (1,4), distance 2. Ghost (specter) at (4,5) is also priority. I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector so precision_shot is available. I'll take the shot on Prophet first, then reposition away from danger. Moving to (4,4) after shooting keeps distance from Aegis at (3,2) and Prophet at (1,4), though it brings me slightly closer to Ghost at (4,5) — still at range 1 which is adjacent, bad. Better to move to (4,3) which keeps distance from Ghost and Aegis. Actually, shoot first then move to maintain distance from all three.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (2,2) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so I shouldn't move (keeps 50% damage reduction). Most enemies are to my north/northeast (Shade at N, Hawk at NE), so shield_wall facing N after attacking.
  State: Aegis 10/12, Ghost 4/4, Prophet 6/10, Shade 1/4, Hawk 2/3, Lifeline 7/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): breach(3,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) facing E, and I'm already behind them. I can breach Aegis to control them, but at 1HP I need to survive. Better option: shadow_strike Aegis (1dmg, keeps cloak if cloaked — but I'm not cloaked). Actually I should breach Aegis since I'm behind them and it would neutralize a healthy sentinel. Then move away to safety. Breach requires being behind enemy — I'm at (2,2), Aegis at (3,2) facing E, behindTiles=[2,2] — yes I'm behind! Use breach on Aegis, then move away from danger toward Prophet at (1,4). Move to (1,3) puts me behind Prophet and adjacent for a follow-up. Wait — breach first, then move to (1,3) to set up shadow_strike on wounded Prophet next turn.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(5,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Lifeline (medic) is adjacent at (5,5). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. But breach cooldown is 1 turn — can't breach yet. Better priority: Hawk is healthy but I can get behind him at (4,4) and breach next turn when cooldown expires. For now, shadow_strike Lifeline to pressure the medic and deny healing, then reposition toward (4,4) to set up breach on Hawk next round.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → scan(5,5) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (1,3) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not a Vector, so scan should still work. However, Shade is already scanned and critical. I should move away from Shade (dangerous at close range with shadow_strike) and scan Lifeline who is the only unscanned enemy still out of range. Moving to (0,5) puts me at distance 5 from Shade, but Lifeline at (5,5) is still dist 5. Let me check: from (1,5) Lifeline at (5,5) is dist 4 — that's in range! Move to (1,5) first, then scan Lifeline at (5,5). This gets me away from Shade and reveals Lifeline's prompt.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,4) which blocks precision_shot (adjacent enemy Vector rule doesn't apply here - that's Vector class, not specter). Ghost is dist=1, Aegis is dist=2. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers. Lifeline is our medic (ally). Enemy has no medic in range. Priority targets: Ghost (specter, healthy, adjacent) and Aegis (sentinel, healthy, dist=2). Ghost is adjacent so precision_shot would work at dist=1. But I need to maintain distance per orders. Ghost is at (4,4) directly north of me. I should move away from Ghost to maintain distance, then use precision_shot. Moving to (5,3) or (5,2) puts me at dist=2 from Ghost at (4,4) - that's still in range. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Aegis. Best: move to (5,3) to step away from Ghost (now dist=2), then precision_shot Ghost (still in range=2). This maintains distance and gets 2dmg on Ghost since I haven't moved before shooting... wait, I'm moving first then shooting, so precision_shot does 1dmg if moved. Alternatively: shoot Ghost first (2dmg, no move penalty, dist=1 in range), then move away. Fire first then move = 2dmg on Ghost.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. I'm at (5,5) which is already near the top-right corner. Valid moves are (3,5), (4,5), (5,4). Moving to (5,4) keeps me on the right edge but moves toward combat. (4,5) or (3,5) move me along the top edge. I'll move to (3,5) to maximize distance from the nearest threat Ghost at (4,4) while staying on the edge. Then wait.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward my own team, away from allies. My allies Ghost is at (4,4) and Prophet is at (1,5). I should move toward my team - moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Ghost at (4,4) while keeping distance. Actually, re-reading: move toward own team, away from allies - this seems contradictory, likely means move toward team/flag area away from enemy allies. I'll move toward Ghost at (4,4) by going to (4,2) then wait to maintain fortify.
  State: Aegis 10/12, Ghost 2/4, Prophet 6/10, Shade 1/4, Hawk 2/3, Lifeline 4/9

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical priority is eliminating Prophet who is wounded and only 2 tiles away. I'm already behind Prophet (facing N, I'm at 1,3 which is south of them at 1,5). I can move to (1,4) which is adjacent and behind Prophet, then use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. Shadow_strike keeps cloak, and Prophet is wounded so this might finish them. This is the safest play — close, high value target, keeps me hidden.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → breach(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/4 HP, cloaked (Ghost). Lifeline is the wounded medic at (3,5) facing W — I can reach (4,5) which is behind her and adjacent. Breach her to waste her heal next turn, then shadow_strike for damage. Hawk is healthy and nearby but breaching Lifeline denies healing which is higher value. Move to (4,5) then breach Lifeline.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (1,4) — critical and dangerous. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not a vector, so scan should work. However, Shade is already scanned. I should move away from Shade to avoid adjacent danger, then use scan or recalibrate. Ghost is wounded at (4,5) — I could recalibrate to buff them, but I need to be adjacent. Moving to (2,5) puts me 2 tiles from Ghost, not adjacent. Moving to (0,5) or (0,4) gets me away from Shade. Better: move to (2,4) to gain distance from Shade, then scan Lifeline (already scanned) or recalibrate Ghost. Actually Ghost is at (4,5) — I need to be adjacent so at (3,5) or (4,4) etc. Those aren't reachable in one move from (1,5) with mv3. I can reach (3,4) which is adjacent to Ghost at (4,5)? No, (3,4) to (4,5) is distance 2. I can reach (2,5) which is distance 2 from Ghost. Not adjacent. Best move: go to (0,4) away from Shade, then scan Hawk — but Hawk is out of range at distance 6. I can't reach Hawk this turn. Lifeline already scanned. Shade already scanned and critical. Move away from Shade to (2,4) and wait, or move to (0,4) for safety. Actually I should move to (2,5) to stay safe, and Lifeline is at (3,5) dist 2 — already scanned. I'll move to (0,4) to get away from Shade, then wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 2HP, so I need to be careful. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers. Lifeline is an ally medic so I skip that. Ghost is a wounded specter at dist=3 - out of range for precision_shot (range≤2). Aegis is a healthy sentinel at dist=2 - in range but orders prioritize medics then damage dealers; sentinel is neither priority but it's the only in-range target. Ghost at (4,5) is dist=3 so out of range at current position. If I move to (4,4), Ghost would be at dist=1 (adjacent), but that's too close and precision_shot is blocked adjacent to enemy Vector - actually that rule is about Vector class, not general adjacency. But moving closer risks taking damage at 2HP. Let me check: from (5,4) Ghost at (4,5) would be dist=2, in range. I can move to (5,4) and then precision_shot Ghost (wounded specter, high value as DPS). Ghost is wounded so finishing it is better than hitting healthy Aegis. From (5,4): Ghost at (4,5) is dist=2, in range. I haven't moved before shooting so full 2dmg. Ghost is wounded - likely low HP, this could finish it.
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Ghost (specter, enemy) is adjacent at (4,5) - critical HP. I should attack Ghost to finish them off, then consider positioning. Shade is at (1,4) with 1HP critical - desperately needs heal. I need to get to Shade. Moving to (2,5) gets me closer to Shade (dist from 2,5 to 1,4 = 2). But Ghost is adjacent now - I must be careful about Vector block on abilities (Ghost is specter not Vector, so no block). I'll attack Ghost first to eliminate the threat, then move toward Shade. Wait - orders say to move away and waste heal, but I must follow my tactical role. I'll attack Ghost (critical, adjacent) to eliminate the threat, then move toward Shade at (1,4) to heal next turn. Moving to (2,5) puts me at dist 2 from Shade.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward own team, away from allies (enemies). Prophet is at (0,4) - that's my ally. I should move toward Prophet. Currently at (4,2), Prophet at (0,4). Moving west toward ally. Best move is toward (2,2) or (3,3) to close distance to Prophet at (0,4). I'll move to (2,2) which is valid and gets me closer to Prophet.
  State: Aegis 10/12, Prophet 5/10, Shade 1/4, Hawk 2/3, Lifeline 4/9 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(1,4) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (1,4) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not a vector, so scan should work. However Shade is already scanned. Shade is critical and adjacent — I could attack for 1dmg to finish them off, but attack is only 1dmg and Shade is critical (likely low HP). Lifeline at (2,5) is wounded and already breached with a bad prompt. Priority: move away from adjacent Shade to avoid shadow_strike, then scan or attack. If I move to (0,3) or (0,5), I increase distance from Shade. Moving to (3,4) puts me 2 tiles from Shade and 2 tiles from Lifeline — good scan position. Actually all enemy prompts are known. I should recalibrate Aegis at (2,2) — but they're not adjacent to me at (0,4). Distance is 2+2=4, not adjacent. I can move toward Aegis and then recalibrate, but Aegis is healthy. Best play: move away from Shade (who will shadow_strike next turn based on foresight — last turn Shade moved to (1,4) then shadow_struck (1,5), so this turn behavior unknown). I'm at 5HP, Shade is adjacent and critical. Attack Shade to potentially finish them, then move away from danger.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded at 2HP (needs heal) but is 4 tiles away - out of reach this turn. I should move toward Hawk to close distance for next turn. My best move is toward (3,4) or (4,5) to get closer. I have 2 heals remaining. I should NOT waste heals on myself or empty tiles as the orders suggest. Moving to (3,4) gets me 2 tiles closer to Hawk. Then wait or hold position.
- **Hawk** (striker): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Both enemies are far (dist 5-6). Aegis is at (2,2), Prophet at (0,3). I need to close distance to get precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). Moving toward Aegis: best move tile toward (2,2) is (4,3) which gets me to dist 4 — still out of range. Even after moving I can't reach range 2. Stay put and wait to preserve position and not expose myself.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(1,2) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward my own team, away from enemies. Prophet is at (0,3) to my west. I should move toward Prophet. Moving to (1,2) then (0,2) gets me closer to Prophet while maintaining distance from enemies at (3,4) and (5,4).
  State: Aegis 10/12, Prophet 5/10, Hawk 2/3, Lifeline 4/9 | Dead: Ghost, Shade

### Turn 7 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is at range 4 and wounded — perfect scan target to deal 1dmg and confirm their breached state. Hawk is out of range at 6. No adjacent enemies so scan is not blocked. I'll scan Lifeline first, then move to maintain positioning. Moving to (1,3) keeps options open while staying safe.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (Prophet at dist=5, Aegis at dist=7). I'm at 2/3 HP so I want to maintain distance while positioning to get Prophet in range next turn. Moving toward (4,3) or (5,3) brings me closer to Prophet without closing on Aegis. I'll move to (4,3) to close distance toward Prophet at (1,3) while staying at range. No enemies in range this turn so second action is wait.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(4,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded at 2/3 HP and adjacent at dist=2. I need to move toward Hawk to heal. Moving to (4,4) gets me adjacent to Hawk at (4,3). Then I can use patch to heal Hawk for 2HP.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) E ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Advance toward Hawk at (4,3) — move to (2,2) to close distance. Enemies are to the east, so shield_wall facing E to protect Prophet at (1,3).
  State: Aegis 10/12, Prophet 5/10, Hawk 3/3, Lifeline 2/9 | Dead: Ghost, Shade

### Turn 8 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → recalibrate(2,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Lifeline is critical and breached — still wasting heals. Hawk is healthy and dangerous with precision_shot targeting medics first. I'm at 5HP, need to be careful. No new scan targets. Aegis shielded me last turn facing E. Best play: move toward Aegis for protection, then recalibrate Aegis to buff them — they're our tank and can absorb hits. Aegis is at (2,2), adjacent to me if I move to (2,3) or (1,2). Move to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (2,2) for recalibrate.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded and at dist=2, making it the priority target. I can use precision_shot on Prophet for 2dmg since I haven't moved yet. After shooting, I should reposition to maintain distance from the advancing enemies. Moving to (5,3) increases distance from both enemies while keeping them in range next turn.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 2/9 HP — critically wounded myself. No allies need healing (Hawk is full HP). Enemies are out of range. I should move toward Prophet at (2,3) who is wounded — I could potentially heal them next turn. Moving toward (3,4) then (2,4) gets me closer. Best move is toward (3,3) or (3,4) to close distance to Prophet. I'll move to (3,4) to get closer to Prophet for next turn healing.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) E ✓
  💭 Need to advance toward Hawk at (5,3). Moving to (4,2) gets me closer and within intercept range next turn. Then shield_wall facing E to block incoming fire from Hawk. Prophet is wounded at (2,3) — shield_wall from (4,2) won't cover them, but my priority is intercepting Hawk. Moving to (3,2) keeps me closer to Prophet but still advancing. Actually (4,2) is my best move — distance 2 from Hawk's likely path at (4,3) or (5,3). Shield_wall E from there protects against Hawk's eastern fire.
  State: Aegis 10/12, Prophet 3/10, Hawk 3/3, Lifeline 2/9 | Dead: Ghost, Shade

### Turn 9 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(4,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk is about to precision_shot me at (2,3) for damage. I'm at 3HP and need to survive. Both enemies already scanned. Lifeline is critical and breached — not a threat. Hawk is the danger. I should move to avoid Hawk's shot, then recalibrate Aegis who is adjacent at (4,2) — wait, Aegis is at (4,2) and I need to be adjacent to recalibrate. From (2,3) I can move to (4,3) which is in valid moves and adjacent to Aegis at (4,2). Then recalibrate Aegis to buff them. Hawk's precision_shot targets (2,3) so moving away denies that damage.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → patch(4,3) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Prophet is wounded and at dist=2. I need to move adjacent to heal. Moving to (4,4) gets me adjacent to Prophet at (4,3) - dist=1. That lets me use patch on Prophet. Hawk is full HP so no heal needed there. After moving to (4,4), Prophet at (4,3) will be adjacent.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. I should move away to get distance, then use precision_shot on Prophet (wounded, high-value oracle). Moving to (5,4) keeps me at range 2 from Prophet at (4,3), enabling precision_shot without the adjacent penalty.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) fortified. Prophet is at (4,3) critical and needs protection. Hawk is at (5,4) dist=3, dangerous striker. I need to advance toward Hawk while protecting Prophet. Moving to (5,3) gets me adjacent to Hawk's likely position and puts me between Hawk and Prophet. From (5,3) I can use shield_wall facing N to block shots coming from Hawk at (5,4) toward Prophet. Valid moves include (5,3).
  State: Aegis 10/12, Prophet 2/10, Hawk 3/3, Lifeline 2/9 | Dead: Ghost, Shade

### Turn 10 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — critical danger. Hawk used precision_shot on me last turn (from Foresight) and Aegis shielded me. Lifeline is at critical HP and already breached. Hawk is healthy and will likely shoot me again. I need to move away from danger. Lifeline is adjacent (4,4) but already breached and useless. I should move to create distance from Hawk, then recalibrate Aegis to strengthen our defense. Moving to (3,2) puts me far from both enemies. Then recalibrate Aegis at (5,3) — wait, that's not adjacent after moving. Let me think: if I move to (3,4), Aegis is at (5,3) — not adjacent. If I stay or move to (3,3), Aegis at (5,3) is still 2+ away. I can't reach Aegis adjacently this turn. Better to just move to safety and wait. Moving to (3,2) gets me away from Hawk at (5,4) — dist becomes ~3. No good recalibrate target in range after moving. I'll move to safety first, then scan Hawk isn't needed (already known). I'll move away and wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (5,3) - this blocks precision_shot. I need to create distance first. Moving to (5,5) puts me 2 tiles from Aegis, enabling precision_shot. Prophet is out of range at dist 4. Priority: move away from Aegis, then use precision_shot on Aegis (sentinel, healthy). Lifeline is critical ally but no enemy medic in range.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → overclock(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 2/9 HP — critically wounded myself. Hawk is at (5,5) with full HP, so no heal needed. No allies adjacent to heal. Enemies: Aegis at (5,3) dist=2, Prophet at (3,2) dist=3, both out of range. Orders say stay adjacent to most threatened ally. Hawk is at (5,5) and is the only ally. I should move toward Hawk to stay adjacent. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,5) and closer to Aegis at (5,3) — but Aegis is an enemy sentinel nearby. Actually moving to (4,5) or (5,4) both get me adjacent to Hawk. (5,4) is valid and adjacent to Hawk. Since Hawk is full HP, I can't heal. I could use overclock on Hawk as the damage dealer after moving adjacent. Move to (5,4) then overclock Hawk at (5,5).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) N ✓
  💭 Lifeline (medic, critical) is adjacent at (5,4) — attack her to eliminate the enemy healer. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Hawk is at (5,5), dist=2, out of melee range. After attacking Lifeline, use shield_wall facing N to block Hawk's precision shots from above.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(5,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is at critical HP and already breached — scan is wasted on them. Hawk is out of range at dist 5. I'm at 2HP so I need to stay safe. Aegis attacked Lifeline last turn and used shield_wall. Hawk will use precision_shot on Aegis at (5,3). I should move to stay safe and recalibrate Aegis who is adjacent at (5,3) — wait, I'm at (3,2) and Aegis is at (5,3), that's dist 3, not adjacent. I can't recalibrate Aegis from here. Best play: move closer to Aegis to set up recalibrate next turn, or scan Lifeline for 2dmg to finish them off. Lifeline is at critical and dist 4 — scan would deal 2dmg and likely finish them. That's high value. I'll scan Lifeline.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 I have OVERCLOCKED status — 2 ability uses this turn. Prophet is critical (almost dead) and in range at dist=3, but precision_shot only reaches 2 tiles. Need to check: Prophet is at (4,3), I'm at (5,5) — dist is 3, out of precision_shot range (≤2). Aegis is at (5,3), dist=2, in range. I should shoot Aegis with precision_shot first, then use suppressing_fire on Aegis or move to get Prophet in range. Actually, if I move to (4,5), Prophet at (4,3) would be dist=2 — in range! But if I move first, precision_shot does 1dmg (moved penalty). Better: use precision_shot on Aegis (dist=2, no move, full 2dmg) first, then precision_shot on Prophet after moving? No — only 2 ability uses, not move+2 abilities. Wait: OVERCLOCKED gives 2 ability uses, so I can do ability+ability, or move+ability+ability? The rules say MOVE + ABILITY or just one. OVERCLOCKED gives 2 ability uses this turn. So I can move + 2 abilities? Or 2 abilities without moving? I'll use firstAction: precision_shot on Aegis (2dmg, dist=2, no movement penalty), secondAction: precision_shot on Prophet — but Prophet is dist=3, out of range from current pos. I need to move to hit Prophet. I'll do: firstAction precision_shot Aegis (2dmg), secondAction move to (4,4) — but then I lose the second ability. Actually OVERCLOCKED = 2 ability uses, so I should stay and use both on Aegis and then suppressing_fire toward Prophet. Let me use precision_shot on Aegis (2dmg), then suppressing_fire targeting... suppressing_fire hits a 2-tile line from target. I'll precision_shot Aegis, then precision_shot Aegis again to finish if possible, or suppressing_fire. Aegis is healthy sentinel (likely 11-12HP), 2+2=4dmg won't kill. Better: precision_shot Prophet if in range. From (5,5) Prophet at (4,3): |5-4|+|5-3|=1+2=3, out of range. Use both shots on Aegis for 4 total damage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (5,5), dist=2, not adjacent so can't attack. Prophet is critical at (4,3) and needs protection. Orders say to intercept Hawk at (4,3) and shield_wall facing E. If I move to (5,4), I'll be adjacent to Hawk at (5,5) and can attack. But orders prioritize protecting Prophet. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to both Prophet and closer to Hawk, but Hawk is at (5,5) so still dist=2 from (4,4). Best move: advance to (5,4) to get adjacent to Hawk at (5,5), then attack. This also keeps me between Hawk and Prophet.
