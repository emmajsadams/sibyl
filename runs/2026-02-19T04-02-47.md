## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Viper** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
### Opponent
- **Grid** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Doc** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move north toward enemy lines. No enemies in range yet, all are 6-8 tiles away. Cloak first, then advance to (0,3) to start infiltrating.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(2,4) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on my damage dealer if all healthy. Grid is the vector (damage dealer) at (2,4), dist=2 — not adjacent. Bulwark is sentinel at (3,5), dist=2 — not adjacent. I need to move adjacent to a damage dealer to use overclock. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Grid at (2,4) — distance 1, allowing overclock. Viper is at (4,1), dist=3 from current position, so moving to (3,4) keeps me safe from Viper denial range.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Enemies are far away (Warden at dist=4, Viper at dist=5). Best use of this turn: move toward the center to control chokepoints, then place traps on likely approach paths. Moving to (2,2) positions me between enemies and allies while keeping trap options. I'll place traps at (2,1) and (3,2) to block the main approach corridors from Warden (south) and Viper (west/north approach).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Grid is 2 tiles away at (2,2) heading south — moving to (2,1) puts me adjacent to Grid and on the front line between allies and enemies. From there I can shield_wall north to protect against Grid's threat.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=5, no adjacent targets. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Warden is at (2,1) and Viper at (4,1), both equidistant. I'll move south toward them. From (3,5), valid moves include (3,3) which closes distance most efficiently. Then use shield_wall facing S (direction of enemies) to protect allies.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 opening. No enemies in range yet. Enemies are at (3,3), (2,2), (2,4) area — likely to advance toward us. I should move forward to (4,2) to get closer and place a trap on (3,2) which is a likely path for Grid or Bulwark to advance through. This creates a denial zone while staying out of Grid's adjacency denial range.
  State: Warden 8/10, Veil 5/5, Viper 6/6, Bulwark 10/10, Grid 5/6, Doc 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Grid at (2,2) facing S has a behind position at (2,3) which is reachable and adjacent. I should move to (2,3) to get behind Grid, then shadow_strike for 2 damage while maintaining cloak. This is the ideal play — I stay hidden and deal significant damage to the Vector who would otherwise deny my abilities.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✗ Position occupied → patch(2,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Grid is wounded at 3HP/6HP and is 3 tiles away at (2,2). I need to close the distance to heal them. Moving to (2,3) gets me adjacent to Grid at (2,2) — distance 1, so I can patch them. Viper is at (4,2) which is 3 tiles from my current position; moving to (2,3) keeps me away from Viper (dist ~2-3), so abilities won't be blocked. After moving to (2,3), Grid at (2,2) is adjacent (south), so I can patch Grid.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is adjacent at (2,2) and wounded — perfect target for attack. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is ideal. Attack Grid to finish them off while keeping fortify bonus.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 There's already a trap at (3,2). Grid is wounded at (2,2) and Bulwark is at (3,3). I'm at (4,2). I should place a trap on a likely movement path — (4,3) or (3,1) could work. But I can't place traps adjacent to enemies (Grid at distance 2, so not adjacent — I'm safe). Bulwark at (3,3) might move toward me or our allies. Placing a trap at (4,3) covers approach from north. Alternatively, move to (4,1) to stay safe and place trap on (3,1) to cover southern approach. Actually, placing trap at (4,3) from current position covers Bulwark's likely path. I'll place trap at (4,3) then move to (5,2) to stay out of Grid's denial range while maintaining positioning.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(2,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP which is critical. Warden is adjacent at (2,1) threatening me. I can't trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Viper is 3 tiles away so that's fine - the issue is I need to deal with Warden. Pulse would hit Warden for 1 damage since it's within 1 tile. I should move away from Warden first to safer ground, then pulse or trap. If I move to (1,3) I get distance from Warden. Actually, pulse first hits Warden (adjacent), then I move away. Let me pulse Warden now (1dmg to all within 1 tile), then move to (3,2) to be closer to allies and place myself for area control. Pulse at my position hits Warden at dist=1.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so can't attack. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Warden is at (2,1), dist=3. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Warden at dist=2. Then use shield_wall facing S (toward Warden's general direction — enemies are south). I lose Fortify by moving, but advancing is ordered.
  State: Warden 7/10, Veil 4/5, Viper 6/6, Bulwark 8/10, Grid 2/6, Doc 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Grid is adjacent and wounded but I'm in their denial zone (can't use cloak/breach). Bulwark is at (3,2) facing S — position (3,3) is directly behind them and reachable. I should move to (3,3) to get behind Bulwark, then breach them while still cloaked. Breach requires being behind — (3,3) is the behind tile for Bulwark facing S. This uses my cloak effectively before it expires and sets up control of Bulwark.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → patch(1,3) ✓
  💭 Grid is critically wounded at 2/6 HP and is the most threatened ally. I need to get adjacent to Grid to heal. Grid is at (1,3), I'm at (3,4). Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Grid (dist=1) and within heal range. Veil is adjacent at (3,3) — patch/overclock are blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Veil is a specter not a vector, so patch is allowed. After moving to (2,3), I can patch Grid at (1,3) to restore 2HP.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,1) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies are adjacent so I can't attack. Doc is at (2,3) dist=2, Bulwark at (3,2) dist=2. If I move to (2,2), I get adjacent to Doc at (2,3) and closer to Bulwark. That lets me attack Doc next action. Alternatively, move to (3,1) to be adjacent to Bulwark at (3,2). Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Doc — I can attack. But I lose fortify. Orders say hold front line and attack adjacent enemies. Moving to (2,2) gets me adjacent to Doc (2,3) so I can attack. Let me move to (2,2) then attack Doc.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at (3,2), dist=2, in range. There's already a trap at (4,3). I should place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to move through. Bulwark is moving south and could step toward me. (4,2) is a likely path tile between Bulwark and me. I'm at (5,2), can't trap adjacent to enemies - Bulwark is at dist=2 so not adjacent, trap is allowed. Place trap at (4,2) to catch Bulwark if it advances, then stay put or reposition.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward allied lines and away from enemies. Allies are at (1,3) and (2,3), enemies at (2,2), (3,3), (4,1). I'm at (3,2) fortified. Moving will lose fortify bonus but orders are to move. Best escape route away from enemies toward allies: (4,2) moves east away from Warden at (2,2) and Veil at (3,3), but keeps distance from Viper at (4,1) — wait, (4,2) is adjacent to Viper denial range. (3,1) moves south, away from Veil but closer to Viper. (4,3) moves northeast, away from Warden and Viper but Veil is at (3,3) so (4,3) is adjacent to Veil. (5,2) moves far east, away from all three enemies and toward open space — but allied lines are west. (1,2) moves west toward allies at (1,3) but goes adjacent to Warden at (2,2). Best move toward allies without going adjacent to enemies: (3,4) moves north, but Veil is at (3,3) so that's adjacent to Veil. (4,2) is adjacent to Viper denial. (3,0) moves south away from allies. (3,1) moves south, closer to Viper. (2,1) moves southwest toward allies but adjacent to Warden. (4,3) is adjacent to Veil at (3,3). Least bad: move to (5,2) to break contact, then wait — or just wait to keep fortify. But orders say move. I'll move to (4,2) — wait, Viper denial is adjacent only, (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1) Viper. Skip that. Move to (5,2) — far from all enemies, then wait.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(2,3) ✗ Position occupied → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 4/6 HP. Warden is at (2,2) dist=2 and Veil is at (3,3) dist=2, both in range. I'm already adjacent to neither enemy so trap is available. I should place a trap on a chokepoint between enemies and my allies. Tile (2,3) is between me and Veil/Warden — placing a trap there would catch movement toward our position. Then I can move to (1,2) to stay mobile and maintain denial pressure while the trap does work.
  State: Warden 7/10, Veil 4/5, Viper 6/6, Bulwark 8/10, Grid 4/6, Doc 5/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (2,3), facing S. I can move to (2,4) to get behind Doc, then shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked. This eliminates the medic threat efficiently. Avoid traps at (4,3) and (4,2). Grid is 3 tiles away so no adjacency concern.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → patch(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 3/6 HP, sandwiched between Warden at (2,2) and Veil at (2,4). Both enemies are adjacent, which blocks my patch/overclock abilities. Grid is wounded at (1,2), dist=2. I need to move away from enemies to use patch. Moving to (3,3) gets me away from Veil and Warden. From (3,3), Grid at (1,2) is dist=3 — still not adjacent. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to Grid at (1,2) and away from Warden/Veil. Let me check: (1,3) is in valid moves. From (1,3), Grid is at (1,2) — dist=1, adjacent. Warden at (2,2) would be dist=2, Veil at (2,4) dist=2. No enemies adjacent, so patch is unblocked. Grid has 4/6 HP, needs heal. This is the best move: go to (1,3), then patch Grid at (1,2).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward allied lines and away from enemies. I'm at (5,2) on the east side, allies are at (1,2) and (1,3). Viper is at (4,1) just 2 tiles away — I need to avoid going adjacent to it. Moving to (4,2) keeps me 1 tile from Viper (at (4,1)) which is adjacent — that's bad. Moving to (4,3) puts me at distance sqrt(1+4)~2.2 from Viper, not adjacent. Or I could move to (3,2) which is dist 2 from Viper. Let me check: (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1) — avoid. (4,3) is not adjacent to (4,1). (3,2) is not adjacent to (4,1). Moving toward allies means going west. I'll move to (4,3) first then (3,2) won't be reachable in one move with mv2. Valid moves show [3,2],[4,2],[4,3],[5,0],[5,1],[5,3],[5,4]. I can move up to 2 tiles. (3,2) is 2 tiles west — valid. That moves me away from Viper at (4,1) and closer to allies. I'll move to (3,2) and wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 50% damage reduction. Grid's denial zone blocks my special abilities, so I can only use basic attack or move. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2) and is a valid attack target. If I move, I lose fortify. Best play: stay put, attack Bulwark to pressure the enemy tank, keep fortify active.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Traps already at (4,2) and (4,3) — good coverage above me. Bulwark is at (3,2), dist=2, in range for attack. I'm adjacent-blocked from trap by... checking: Bulwark is at dist=2, not adjacent, so trap is allowed. But tiles (4,2) and (4,3) already have traps. I should place a trap on a tile enemies might pass through — (3,1) or (5,2) could work, but enemies are coming from the west/northwest. (3,0) or (2,1) might intercept movement. Actually, I can attack Bulwark directly at range 2 — wait, attack is adjacent only (range:adjacent). So I can only trap or pulse. Pulse hits all within 1 tile — no enemies adjacent currently. Best play: place trap at (3,1) to cover approach path, then wait or move. Bulwark is at (3,2) heading W, Grid at (1,2) heading S. Trap at (3,1) could catch Bulwark if it moves south. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so trap is valid.
- **Grid** (vector): move(0,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,2) — my Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. I can't place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector... wait, Viper is the enemy Vector, not Warden. Warden is a sentinel. So trap is blocked only if adjacent to an enemy Vector. Viper is at (4,1), not adjacent. I can place a trap. Best chokepoint: (2,3) between Veil coming down from (2,4) and my position, or (1,4) to block approach. Actually Warden is right next to me — pulse hits all within 1 tile, dealing 1dmg to Warden (and Doc at (1,3)). Better to use pulse on Warden now for pressure, then move away. Or: move to (2,3) first to intercept Veil's path, then trap at (2,4) area... but (2,4) is where Veil currently is. Let me place trap at (2,3) to block Veil's advance southward, after moving there. Actually I can trap from current position if target is ≤2 tiles away. (2,3) is distance 1+1=2, valid. But moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Warden still. Better: pulse Warden now (1dmg, also hits Doc at dist=1... Doc is wounded, bad). Pulse at my pos hits everything within 1 tile. Doc is at (1,3) dist=1, Warden at (2,2) dist=1. Would hurt Doc. Skip pulse. Instead: move to (0,3) to create distance, then trap at (2,3) to block Veil's south path — dist from (0,3) to (2,3) is 2, valid.
  State: Warden 7/10, Veil 4/5, Viper 6/6, Bulwark 7/10, Grid 6/6, Doc 3/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded and I'm behind them — (2,3) is reachable, adjacent, and behind Doc facing W. Move to (2,3) then shadow_strike Doc to finish them off without breaking cloak.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with only 1HP — critically low. Veil is adjacent at (2,3) and I cannot patch while adjacent to an enemy (but Veil is a specter, not a vector — the block only applies to Vector enemies). Wait, re-reading: patch/overclock blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Viper is the Vector but dist=5, Grid is allied Vector. So I can use abilities freely. Bulwark is wounded at (3,2) dist=3, not adjacent. I have 1 heal left. I need to reach Bulwark to heal. Best move toward Bulwark: (3,3) gets me dist=1 from Bulwark. But I'm at 1HP — moving toward enemies is risky. From (3,3) I'd be adjacent to Warden at (2,2). I could move to (1,2) then next turn move closer. Actually orders say stay adjacent to most threatened ally and heal most wounded. Bulwark at 7/10 is wounded. I should move toward Bulwark. Move to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (3,2) — wait, dist from (3,3) to (3,2) is 1, so I can patch. But (3,3) also puts me dist=1 from Warden at (2,2). At 1HP that's very dangerous. Let me move to (1,2) instead — safer, dist=2 from Bulwark. Or move to (2,4) to avoid Warden. Actually the orders are clear: heal most wounded. I need to get adjacent to Bulwark. Move to (3,3) then patch Bulwark at (3,2).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2). I'm fortified (50% DR) and should stay put to keep fortify active. Attack Bulwark now, then use shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Bulwark's direction.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(5,2) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (4,1) facing S. Traps already at (4,3), (4,2), (3,1) — good coverage northeast. Bulwark is at (3,2) dist=2, within my attack range. Doc is critical at (3,3) — priority target but out of range. I can't place trap adjacent to enemies (Bulwark at (3,2) is dist=2, not adjacent, so trap is allowed). Key move: place a trap on (3,0) or (5,2) to extend denial zone, or attack Bulwark directly. Bulwark is healthy so attack does 1dmg. Better to lay a trap on (5,2) to cover flanking routes, then attack Bulwark at (3,2) from current position since it's in range.
- **Grid** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → pulse(1,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded and at distance 2 — within pulse range (1 tile AoE) if I move to (1,3). From (1,3), Veil at (2,3) is 1 tile away, perfect for pulse. This would hit Veil and potentially Warden at (2,2) if they're within 1 tile of (1,3) — Warden is at distance 2 from (1,3) so no. Just Veil. After pulse, I can place a trap on (1,2) or (2,3) to block the corridor between enemies and allies. Actually: move to (1,3) first, then pulse targeting Veil at (2,3) — Veil is wounded so this could finish or severely pressure them. Alternatively, trap first at a chokepoint. From current (0,3), I can trap tiles within 2 — that includes (1,2),(2,3),(1,4),(0,5),(2,1) etc. But trap is blocked if adjacent to enemy — Veil is at (2,3), distance 2, not adjacent, so trap is fine. Plan: move to (1,3) to get adjacent denial on Veil, then pulse to hit Veil (wounded, 1 tile away). This pressures Veil and denies their abilities.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward allied lines and away from enemies. I'm at (3,2), enemies are to my west (Warden at 2,2) and northwest (Veil at 2,3). Allied lines are to my east. Moving to (4,2) puts me one step east, away from enemies and toward allies. Then (5,2) gets me further from the front. I should not attack since orders say move toward allied lines.
  State: Warden 7/10, Veil 1/5, Viper 6/6, Bulwark 4/10, Grid 6/6, Doc 1/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical survival situation. Doc is critical and I'm already behind them (I'm at 2,3, Doc at 3,3 facing E, behind tile is 2,3 = my current position). Grid is adjacent and has DENIAL blocking my abilities. I need to eliminate Doc with shadow_strike first — but DENIAL from Grid blocks abilities! Only basic attack works while adjacent to Grid. I can attack Doc (adjacent, dist=1) with basic attack for 1dmg — Doc is critical so 1dmg should finish them. Then I need to escape. Actually wait: shadow_strike range is adjacent only, and DENIAL blocks abilities. So I must use basic attack on Doc. Attack Doc first (finishes them), then move away from Grid to survive.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(5,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(5,0) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded and at dist=2, within my attack range. I have traps at (4,3) and (3,1). I should attack Bulwark to pressure them. I can't place a trap adjacent to an enemy, but Bulwark is at (5,2) and I'm at (4,1) — not adjacent, so trap placement at (4,3) or (5,0) could work to channel movement. Actually, (4,3) already has a trap. Let me attack Bulwark since they're wounded and in range, then place a trap on (5,0) to cut off their retreat/movement south.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is critical at (2,4) and within range 2. I can attack Veil to potentially finish them. Warden is at (2,2) healthy. I'm at (1,3). If I move to (2,3), I'll be adjacent to both Warden and Veil, enabling denial to block their abilities, and I can attack Veil at range 1. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Warden which triggers denial on them. Then attack Veil at (2,4) to finish the critical specter.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 4HP, fortified. No enemies adjacent. Nearest enemy is Viper at (4,1) dist=2, Warden at (2,2) dist=3. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to both. Viper is at (4,1) — from (4,2) that's adjacent, so I can attack. But wait, Viper has denial range adjacent, meaning if I move adjacent I get blocked. Let me check: the caution says avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked. So I should not move to (4,2) since Viper is at (4,1), which would be adjacent. Instead move to (5,1) to get closer to Viper without being adjacent, then use shield_wall facing W (toward enemies at (2,2) and (4,1) — they're both to my west/southwest). Actually with orders to advance, I should move closer. From (5,1), Viper at (4,1) is still dist=1 (adjacent), so that's also adjacent. Let me move to (4,2) — Viper at (4,1) would be adjacent... but the caution warns against it. Let me move to (3,2) instead — dist to Viper becomes 2, dist to Warden becomes 1 (adjacent at (2,2)!). Then I can attack Warden. From (3,2): Warden at (2,2) is distance 1 = adjacent. Attack Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, adjacent to wounded Bulwark (priority target) and healthy Grid. Grid's DENIAL zone blocks abilities, but basic attack still works. I should attack Bulwark to finish off the wounded enemy — this is a free strike while fortified. Since Grid's DENIAL blocks abilities, I can't use shield_wall anyway. I'll stay put to keep Fortify active and attack Bulwark.
  State: Warden 6/10, Viper 6/6, Bulwark 3/10, Grid 6/6 | Dead: Veil, Doc

### Turn 7 — player
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 6HP, adjacent to both Bulwark (wounded, dist=1) and Grid (dist=1, DENIAL active). Grid's denial blocks my abilities except basic attack and movement. I should attack Bulwark since it's wounded — finishing it reduces enemy pressure. I can't use shield_wall due to Grid's denial zone. Staying put preserves fortify bonus. Attack Bulwark first, then since abilities are blocked by denial, I'll wait to keep fortify active.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical and only distance 2 — I can attack it directly. Attack Bulwark to potentially finish it off. Then move to (4,2) to stay mobile and near ally Warden while avoiding the trap at (4,3).
- **Grid** (vector): attack(2,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,2), wounded. My Denial passive already blocks some of their abilities. I can attack Warden for 1dmg to help finish them off, and place a trap between Viper and our position to deny approach. Moving to (3,3) first keeps distance from Viper while still threatening Warden, then trap at (3,2) to block Viper's advance path toward our ally Bulwark at (3,2)... wait, Bulwark is at (3,2) so I can't trap there. Instead, attack Warden now while adjacent, then move away from Viper.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active (50% dmg reduction if I don't move). Two enemies adjacent: Warden (wounded, dist=1) and Viper (healthy, dist=1). Orders say attack adjacent enemy — Warden is wounded so attacking them is higher value kill. I'm in Viper's denial zone so shield_wall is blocked. Best play: stay put to keep fortify, attack Warden. If I don't move, fortify stays active. Attack Warden first (wounded = likely kill). Can't use shield_wall due to denial zone. Second action: wait to preserve fortify.
  State: Warden 4/10, Viper 6/6, Bulwark 2/10, Grid 6/6 | Dead: Veil, Doc

### Turn 8 — player
- **Grid** (vector): attack(2,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 2. Warden is wounded at (2,2), Viper is healthy at (4,2). I'm at (3,3) full health. I can attack Warden from here (dist=2, rng2). I should avoid moving adjacent to Viper or my abilities get blocked. I can place a trap between enemy positions to control the area — tile (3,2) is directly between both enemies and adjacent to my ally Bulwark, but that might harm ally. Better to place trap at (2,3) to intercept Warden's likely advance north, or (4,3) to catch Viper. Since Warden is wounded, attacking them is priority. I'll attack Warden first (dist=2, in range), then place a trap at (3,2) to deny the space between enemies — wait, Bulwark is at (3,2) so can't place there. Place trap at (2,3) to intercept Warden if they move north.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) E ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2) and critical — attack to finish. I'm fortified (50% DR) so staying put is valuable. If I don't move, fortify stays active. Attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall East to block Grid.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,2) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical and adjacent at (3,2) - attack to finish them off. Grid is at (3,3) distance 2, healthy. After attacking Bulwark, I should place a trap to control the area. Can't trap at (4,3) or (3,1) - already trapped. I'm not adjacent to Grid so trap isn't blocked. Place trap at (2,3) or another likely movement corridor. Actually, Grid is at (3,3) moving E - placing trap at (4,3) would be good but it's already trapped. Try (5,3) to cover escape routes, or (2,2) area. Grid moving east might go to (4,3) but that's trapped. Let me attack Bulwark first (critical, adjacent = easy kill), then place trap at (5,3) to cover flanking routes.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Grid** (vector): attack(2,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with full HP. Warden is wounded at (2,2) dist=2, Viper is healthy at (4,2) dist=2. There's already a trap at (2,3). I can't place traps adjacent to enemies, and Viper's denial blocks my trap if I'm adjacent to them. I should place a trap to control the approach corridor. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer but risks adjacency to Viper at (4,2) — dist would be 2, still safe. Actually, I can attack Warden from current position (dist=2, range=2). Let me attack Warden to finish off the wounded unit, then place a trap at (3,1) to block the southern approach.
- **Warden** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 4HP, fortified (50% dmg reduction). Grid is at (3,3) distance 2, not adjacent so can't attack. Moving to (3,2) would put me adjacent to Grid and block their denial range, but I'd lose fortify. Better to hold position and maintain fortify bonus — wait preserves my damage reduction and I stay between allies and enemies.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,3) heading East, dist=2. I'm at (4,2). Valid moves include (4,3) but that's a trap. (5,2) or (5,1) keep distance. Grid will likely move East toward (4,3) or (5,3) — both already trapped, good. I can place a trap at (3,2) to cut off Grid's southern escape route. But wait — Grid is at dist=2, so I'm NOT adjacent, trap is allowed. Place trap at (3,2) which is a likely movement path. Then move to (5,2) to maintain range and avoid getting adjacent to Grid.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,1) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,3) moving east, 3 tiles away. Traps already at (5,3) and (4,3) blocking eastern approach. I should place a trap at (4,2) to cover another likely path. Move to (4,2) first, then trap at (3,2) — but wait, (3,2) already has a trap. Let me check: traps at (4,3),(3,1),(5,0),(5,3),(3,2). Valid moves include (4,2) and (4,1). If Grid moves east from (3,3) toward me, (4,3) is already trapped. I'll move to (4,2) to stay out of Grid's denial range while placing a trap at (3,2)... already trapped. Place trap at (4,1) to cover southern escape. Actually, move to (5,1) to stay safe and range-2 from (3,1)/(4,1)/(5,3) area, then trap (4,1) to further block paths.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(5,1) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,2) with 4HP. Grid is at (3,3) distance 2 — not adjacent so can't attack. Moving closer would break fortify and lose 50% damage reduction which is critical at low HP. Viper is at (5,1) to the south. I should hold position and use shield_wall to protect Viper from Grid's threat direction. Grid is to my NE, so shield_wall facing E or N could help. I'll wait to maintain fortify and use shield_wall toward Grid's direction to protect allies.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (2,2), distance 2 — within attack range. I can pulse to hit Warden for 1 damage (it's within 1 tile if I move adjacent). But I'm at (3,3) and Warden is at (2,2) — that's distance 2, not adjacent. Valid moves include (2,3) which would put me adjacent to Warden at (2,2). Moving to (2,3) puts me next to Warden, enabling attack AND denial aura to block their abilities. However (2,3) has a trap — I'd step on it for 2 damage. Bad idea. Move to (3,2) instead — that puts me at dist 1 from Warden (2,2), adjacent diagonally... wait, adjacency is cardinal only typically. (3,2) to (2,2) is distance 1 (one step west), so adjacent. I can then attack Warden for 1 damage. Denial aura would suppress their abilities too. Let me move to (3,2) and attack Warden at (2,2).

### Turn 11 — player
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 3HP, fortified, adjacent to Grid at (3,2). Grid's DENIAL zone blocks abilities other than basic attack. I should attack Grid since it's adjacent and I can't use shield_wall here anyway. Staying put preserves Fortify (50% dmg reduction) — critical at 3HP. Attack Grid, then wait to keep fortified status.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,2) wounded, moving south toward us. Traps at (3,1) and (4,1) already cover likely paths. (4,2) is an uncovered tile Grid might step through moving south or east. I should place a trap there. I'm at (5,1) and need to stay out of denial range (adjacent to Grid). Move to (4,2) to place trap, but that puts me dist=1 from Grid at (3,2) — too close, denial would block trap. Better: stay at (5,1) or move to (5,2)/(5,3) and place trap at (4,2) from range. From (5,1), trap range is ≤2 tiles — (4,2) is distance 2 (|5-4|+|1-2|=2), so I can trap it from current position. Place trap at (4,2) first, then move to (5,2) to stay mobile and away from Grid.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(2,2) ✓ → pulse(3,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,2) — wounded, good kill target. I can attack Warden for 1dmg, then pulse to hit both Warden and potentially zone Viper. Actually pulse range is 1 tile AoE from my position, Warden is at dist=1 so pulse hits Warden. Viper is at dist=2, out of pulse range. Attack Warden first (1dmg), then pulse to finish if still alive — pulse hits all within 1 tile so Warden at dist=1 gets hit. Trap at (4,3) already exists. My denial passive blocks Warden's abilities since adjacent. Priority: kill Warden with attack + pulse combo.
