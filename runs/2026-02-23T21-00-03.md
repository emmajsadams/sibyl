## Squads
### Player
- **Bolt** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
### Opponent
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is at dist=4 which is within scan range (≤4). But from current position (1,1), the recon says Ghost is 'inRange: false'. I need to move closer to bring Ghost within scan range. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer. From (1,3), dist to Ghost at (2,4) = |2-1|+|4-3| = 1+1 = 2, well within range. I'll move north to (1,3) then scan Ghost to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(2,4) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Lens is only 2 tiles away at (1,3) facing N, with (1,2) being the tile behind them. I can cloak first, then move to (1,2) to get behind Lens, positioning for a shadow_strike or breach next turn while staying invisible.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Viper is at distance 4, Marksman at 6. I need range 2 for precision_shot. Move toward Viper to get in range while staying out of adjacent (deny) range. Moving to (4,2) gets me to dist=2 from Viper at (4,4), which is exactly precision_shot range.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-6, max range 2). Closest are Bolt at (4,2) and Lens at (1,3), both dist 4. I need to close distance to get within range 2. Moving to (3,3) reduces dist to Bolt to 2 and dist to Lens to 2, putting both in range. I'll move there then shoot Lens (oracle = high-value support target).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Nearest enemy is Marksman at (3,3), dist 4. I need to advance. Best move toward (3,3) is (3,1) which closes distance. Then use shield_wall facing N since both enemies are to the north.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (4,2), distance 2 — within my range but not adjacent, so I can't attack directly. I'm at (4,4). My orders are to place traps between enemies and allies. Bolt is advancing from (4,2) heading north (toward my allies). If I move to (4,3), I'd be adjacent to Bolt at (4,2) — that blocks my trap ability due to Vector's trap restriction near adjacent enemies. Better to stay at (4,4) or shift slightly and place a trap on (4,3) — the tile between me and Bolt — to punish their advance. From (4,4), (4,3) is within ≤2 tiles so trap is valid. I'm not adjacent to any enemy currently, so trap is not blocked. Place trap at (4,3) to intercept Bolt's likely advance path.
  State: Bastion 8/8, Bolt 4/4, Lens 5/6, Ghost 3/4, Viper 8/9, Marksman 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is directly adjacent at (1,3), I'm already behind them (they face N, I'm at (1,2) which is south = behind). Cloak has 1 turn remaining — shadow_strike keeps cloak active and I'm in perfect position. Use shadow_strike on Lens to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. No need to move first.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (1,2) and already scanned. Marksman at (3,3) is unsanced and shot me last turn (Foresight shows precision_shot at (1,3)). I should scan Marksman to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. Then move away from Ghost to avoid being flanked — Ghost is adjacent and will likely attack. Moving to (2,4) puts me at distance 2 from Ghost and keeps Marksman in scan range next turn. Actually I already acted this turn per the order (Lens goes second in order after Ghost). Ghost is at (1,2) adjacent — dangerous. I should scan Marksman first for intel, then move north away from Ghost.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is closest at dist 2 and is a damage dealer — priority target. I can use precision_shot for 2dmg. I haven't moved yet so no movement penalty. Stay at current position to maintain range. Ghost is dist 3, just in range but Marksman is higher priority as a fellow striker threatening my allies. Viper is a vector but at dist 3, not adjacent so no suppression risk.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 2/4 HP. Two enemies in range: Bastion (sentinel) at (3,1) dist=2 and Bolt (striker) at (3,2) dist=2. Orders say shoot high-value targets — damage dealers (Bolt) after medics. No medics visible, so Bolt is priority. I haven't moved this turn so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Need to check adjacency: Bolt is at (4,2), not adjacent to me. No Vector adjacent to me either, so precision_shot is not blocked. I'll shoot Bolt with precision_shot for 2dmg, then move to maintain distance. Moving to (3,5) puts more space between me and enemies while avoiding the trap at (4,3).
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is closest at dist=3, approaching from (4,2). I have a trap at (4,3) already. I should move toward (4,4) to get closer to Bolt while staying near my existing trap for denial. From (4,4) I can place another trap at (4,3)... wait, trap already there. Better to move to (4,4) and place a trap at (3,4) to create a corridor of traps blocking Bolt's approach path toward our allies. Marksman is wounded at (3,5) - I should help protect that flank. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Marksman for support and I can trap (3,5) area or (4,4) to block Bolt's advance.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack possible. Nearest enemy is Ghost at (1,2) dist=3. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Ghost and Marksman. Then shield_wall facing N covers the most enemies (Ghost at (1,2) is NW, Marksman at (3,5) is N, Viper at (4,4) is NE). Shield_wall facing N protects allies from northern threats.
  State: Bastion 8/8, Bolt 3/4, Lens 4/6, Ghost 3/4, Viper 8/9, Marksman 2/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) uncloaked. Orders say to assassinate enemy damage dealer — that's Bolt (striker) at (4,2). No positions behind Bolt are reachable this turn. Lens (oracle) is at (0,4) and (0,3) is reachable and behind them. But orders prioritize damage dealers, and Lens is a support. Bastion breach target at (3,2) is reachable — moving there puts me adjacent and behind. However, priority is damage dealer assassination. I can't reach Bolt directly. Best move: reposition toward Bolt's side. Move to (3,2) to get behind Bastion for a breach next turn, or move to (2,2) to close on Bolt. Actually (3,2) is behind Bastion and adjacent — I could breach Bastion to reposition them, but orders say use breach on sentinels to break defensive posture. Let me move to (3,2) and breach Bastion — this controls the sentinel and opens the field. I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't help. Move to (3,2), then breach Bastion.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 Viper is at dist=4 from my current position (0,4) — exactly at scan range. But scan range is ≤4 tiles, and Viper is at (4,4) which is dist=4. However the recon says 'inRange: false' for all enemies from current position. I need to move closer. Marksman is wounded and already scanned. Ghost is already scanned. Viper is the only unknown — need its prompt. Moving to (1,4) puts me dist=3 from Viper at (4,4), which should be in scan range. But WARNING: Viper is a Vector — I must NOT be adjacent to Viper or scan is blocked. (1,4) to (4,4) is dist=3, not adjacent, so scan should work. Let me move to (1,4) then scan Viper at (4,4). This keeps me safely behind the front line while gathering intel on the last unknown enemy.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away first. Moving to (5,2) keeps distance from Ghost and stays out of Viper's adjacent denial zone. From (5,2), Ghost will be at dist=2, allowing precision_shot for 2dmg. Viper at (4,4) is dist=2 from new position - not adjacent, so no blocking. This is the priority target as specter.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 2HP, wounded. Bastion sentinel is at (3,3) dist=2 in range, but sentinels are tanky — not priority. Lens oracle at (1,4) dist=3 is out of range. There's a trap at (3,4) blocking direct south movement. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers. Lens is an oracle (high value). I need to get Lens in range — moving to (2,5) would put me at dist 3 to Lens still. Moving to (2,4) — but that's adjacent to Lens at (1,4)? No, Lens is at (1,4) and (2,4) is dist=1, which means precision_shot blocked if Vector adjacent... but Viper (vector ally) is at (4,4), not adjacent to me firing position. Let me check: from (2,4) to Lens at (1,4) = dist 1, that's adjacent, so I'd use attack not precision_shot. Better: stay at (3,5) and shoot Bastion at dist=2 with precision_shot (I haven't moved). Bastion is healthy but in range. Actually orders say medics first then damage dealers — oracle Lens is a priority target. But Lens is at dist=3, out of range from here. I can't reach Lens in range this turn without moving, and moving penalties apply. Stay put and precision_shot Bastion at dist=2 for full 2dmg since I won't move first.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move south toward (3,1). I'm at (3,3), fortified. Ghost is adjacent at (3,2) — moving south through (3,2) isn't valid, but (3,1) is listed as a valid move tile. I'll move to (3,1) and wait. Moving will lose fortify, but orders are clear.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with traps already at (4,3) and (3,4). No enemies in range from current position. Lens is at (1,4) moving east - likely approaching along row 4. I should move west to position myself between Lens and my allies, then place a trap to cover the approach. Moving to (3,5) puts me near the action. Actually, moving to (3,3) lets me threaten Bolt at (5,2) with denial and place traps along enemy approach routes. Let me move to (5,4) to be closer to Bolt and place a trap at (5,3) to block Bolt's movement path - Bolt is at (5,2) moving east which is odd. Actually let me move to (3,5) to guard the flank near Marksman, then place a trap at (3,4) - wait, trap already there. I'll move to (4,5) and place a trap at (3,5) to cover the northwest approach where Lens is coming from.
  State: Bastion 7/8, Bolt 3/4, Lens 4/6, Ghost 2/4, Viper 7/9, Marksman 2/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) at 2HP, behind Bastion at (3,1) facing S. Breach is on cooldown. Orders say to prioritize enemy damage dealer — that's Bolt at (5,2). I'm already behind Bastion. I could shadow_strike Bastion for 1dmg (he's adjacent), but my priority is Bolt. I can move to (4,2) which puts me adjacent and behind Bolt. Then shadow_strike Bolt for 1dmg while staying cloaked — but wait, I'm not cloaked (cloak was round 1, 3 turns = expired). So no cloak. I should move to (4,2) to get behind Bolt, then attack Bolt for 1dmg. Alternatively shadow_strike Bastion now and move toward Bolt. At 2HP I need to be careful. Best play: move to (4,2) to flank Bolt, then shadow_strike Bolt — but shadow_strike requires cloak. I'm not cloaked. So I'll use regular attack on Bolt after moving adjacent. Move to (4,2), attack Bolt at (5,2).
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(3,2) ✗ No enemy at target
  💭 Marksman is at (2,5), distance 2 from my current position (1,4) — within scan range of 4. Marksman is already scanned so I know their prompt. Viper is at (4,5) distance 4 — exactly at scan range limit, but from current position. Ghost is out of range at dist 5. Foresight shows Ghost will move to (3,2) then breach (3,3) — threatening Bastion area. Viper will trap (3,5) — blocking movement toward allies. I should move to get Ghost in scan range if possible, but Ghost will be at (3,2) after move. From (4,4) I could reach Ghost at (3,2)? Dist = |4-3|+|4-2| = 1+2 = 3, within range 4. But (4,4) is in valid moves. Actually Viper at (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4) — Viper has denial that blocks adjacent enemy abilities, so scanning from (4,4) would be blocked. From (3,4): dist to Ghost at (3,2) = 0+2=2, in range. Viper at (4,5) dist from (3,4) = 1+1=2, not adjacent, so no denial block. Move to (3,4) then scan Ghost at (3,2) post-move position. This gives team updated intel on Ghost who is the main threat to our striker Bolt.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle, wounded) is at distance 2 and in range. Priority targets are medics first per orders — oracle counts as high-value support. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Lens is wounded so 2dmg likely finishes it. No need to move first — staying at (2,5) keeps distance from other enemies. Fire precision_shot on Lens, then wait.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Ghost is a specter not a Vector, so check: the warning says blocked by adjacent enemy Vector specifically. Viper (vector) is at (4,5), dist=4, not adjacent. So precision_shot is available. However, Ghost is only distance 1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2 tiles. Adjacent is within range 2. I need to check if I moved — if I move first, precision_shot does 1dmg; if I shoot first then move, it does 2dmg. Ghost is wounded, so 2dmg may finish it. Shoot first with precision_shot (2dmg, no movement penalty), then move away to maintain distance. Valid move tiles include (5,3), (5,1), (4,3), (4,1) — move to (5,3) or (5,4) to create distance from Ghost.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt(wounded) and Lens(wounded) are both within range 2 from current position. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile AoE - from (4,5) that would hit Bolt at (5,4) which is distance 2, not adjacent. Need to check adjacency: pulse range is 1 tile. Bolt is at (5,4), I'm at (4,5) - that's diagonal distance ~1.4, not adjacent. Lens at (3,4) is distance 2. Neither is adjacent for pulse. Best move: use attack on Bolt (range adjacent only - distance 2, not valid). My attack range is adjacent only. Trap range is ≤2 tiles. I can place a trap. Valid moves include (4,4) which would put me adjacent to Bolt at (5,4) and closer to Lens at (3,4). Move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Bolt, then use pulse to hit Bolt (and possibly Lens if within 1 tile from new position). From (4,4): Bolt at (5,4) is distance 1 (adjacent), Lens at (3,4) is distance 1 (adjacent). Pulse from (4,4) hits ALL units within 1 tile - both Bolt and Lens take 1dmg each! This is excellent since both are wounded. Move to (4,4), then pulse targeting (4,4) or center.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move south away from Bolt and center. Currently at (3,1), moving south. Valid moves include (3,0) which is directly south. No enemies in melee range, so no ability to use. Will move to (3,0) and wait.
  State: Bastion 7/8, Bolt 1/4, Lens 1/6, Ghost 1/4, Viper 7/9, Marksman 2/4

### Turn 5 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → breach(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Bolt is critical and at (5,4) facing N, with (5,3) as the behind tile and reachable. Moving to (5,3) puts me adjacent and behind Bolt. I can then use breach to take control of Bolt — using a critical striker against enemies is devastating. Breach is ready and this is a prime use case. Watch out for trap at (4,3) — avoid it. Path: move to (5,3) directly (dist=1 from there, reachable within mv3).
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critically wounded and adjacent to Viper's denial zone which blocks my scan ability. I need to escape immediately. Moving away from Viper is the priority. I can't use scan while in denial zone. Moving to (1,4) gets me away from Viper and Marksman's precision shot range. Then I can recalibrate Bolt who is critical nearby, but Bolt is at (5,4) — too far for recalibrate (adjacent only). Best move: flee to safety at (1,4) or (1,5) to survive. Marksman targeted me last turn with precision_shot at (3,4) — staying here is death. Move to (1,5) to break LOS angle and get distance from all threats.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(1,5) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle, critical) is adjacent at (1,5). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Lens is an oracle not a Vector, so precision_shot should work. However, at dist=1 (adjacent), precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2 — dist 1 qualifies. But wait: the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically, not all enemies. Lens is oracle, so no block. I can fire precision_shot on Lens for 2 damage to finish off a critical oracle. Then move away to maintain distance from remaining threats. Move to (0,5) or (2,4) after shooting. I'll shoot first then move to (2,3) to get distance from Bolt at (5,4).
- **Bolt** (striker): attack(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, critical condition. Adjacent to Viper (denial zone blocks precision_shot). Ghost is at dist=1 and critical — a basic attack will finish them. Viper is healthy and dangerous. I should attack Ghost to eliminate them, then wait or reposition. Basic attack works despite denial zone.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent (dist=1) and critical - I can finish them with attack. Then I should reposition. I'm moving south which puts me closer to the action. Bastion is far at dist=5. After killing Bolt, I should move to control the chokepoint area. Tile (4,3) already has a trap. I could move to (3,4) or (3,5) to be near my trap at (3,5) and deny enemies approaching ally Marksman at (2,3). Let me attack Bolt first to finish them off, then move to (3,4) to maintain denial pressure on any enemy approaching through the center.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move south toward (3,1). I'm currently at (3,0) and fortified. Moving to (3,1) is valid per recon data. After moving I'll lose fortify, but I'm following orders. No enemies in range so no ability to use.
  State: Bastion 7/8, Viper 7/9, Marksman 2/4 | Dead: Bolt, Lens, Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 2HP, Bastion is at (3,1) distance 3 which is in range for precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 means out of precision_shot range which is ≤2). Let me reconsider. precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, but Bastion is at dist=3. However the recon says Bastion is inRange:true. The range check shows dist=3 inRange=true, so the game engine considers it in range. I'll use precision_shot on Bastion. I haven't moved this turn so no penalty. I should maintain distance - stay at (2,3) or move further away. Current position is fine. Fire precision_shot then wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=3, out of range. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Marksman is wounded at (2,3), priority target. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to both enemies. From (3,3) I'm still not adjacent to anyone but closer. I should use shield_wall facing N toward Viper at (3,4) to protect against incoming damage. Moving to (3,3) then shield_wall N.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive is already blocking their special abilities. I can't trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector rule. I should pulse to hit Bastion for 1 damage, then move away to (4,4) to place a trap between Bastion and Marksman next turn. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Marksman is at (2,3) which is distance ~1.4 from me, so outside pulse range. Bastion at dist=1 will take the pulse hit.
  State: Bastion 6/8, Viper 7/9, Marksman 2/4 | Dead: Bolt, Lens, Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,3) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Bastion is a sentinel not Vector, so precision_shot should work. However, I'm at 2HP and adjacent to an enemy sentinel. Priority: move away to create distance, then use precision_shot. Valid moves include (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (1,4) etc. Moving to (1,3) gives distance 2 from Bastion at (3,3). From (1,3), Bastion at (3,3) is dist=2, still in range for precision_shot. But if I move first, precision_shot does 1dmg (reduced when moved). Alternatively, shoot first then move — precision_shot at full 2dmg from current pos, but Bastion is adjacent (dist=1, range≤2 so valid), then move away. Shoot first for full damage, then retreat.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,3), dist 2. I have traps at (4,3) and (3,5). Orders say control chokepoints between enemies and allies. Marksman is at (1,3) wounded - Bastion at (3,3) is threatening them. I should place a trap at (3,4) or (2,4) to block Bastion's advance toward Marksman. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Bastion (dist 1) enabling Denial, but then I can't trap (blocked when adjacent to enemy). Better: stay at (4,4) and trap (3,4) - this is within range 2 and blocks Bastion's path north toward Marksman. Then move to (5,4) to stay back and maintain range.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with Fortify active. Marksman is 2 tiles away at (1,3) to my west, wounded. I should advance toward Marksman to attack next turn. Moving to (2,3) closes distance to 1 tile (adjacent), but wait — Fortify requires I didn't move. If I move, I lose 50% damage reduction and I'm at 5/8 HP. However, orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Marksman at dist=2 is nearest and wounded — priority target. Moving west to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Marksman. But I can't attack after moving to (2,3) since the move gets me adjacent but that would be my move action... I can move to (2,3) then attack Marksman at (1,3) which would be adjacent. Valid moves include (2,3). Let me move to (2,3) and attack Marksman. Also set shield_wall facing W since enemies are to the west.
  State: Bastion 5/8, Viper 7/9, Marksman 1/4 | Dead: Bolt, Lens, Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(0,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm at 1HP with Bastion adjacent at (2,3). Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Bastion is a sentinel not a Vector, so I need to check - the warning says precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Viper is my ally Vector, so precision_shot should be available. However, Bastion is adjacent (dist=1) and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles. I should move away first to avoid being attacked, then use precision_shot. Moving to (0,3) or (0,4) puts me at dist=2 from Bastion, which is still in range for precision_shot. Let me move to (0,4) to gain distance, then use precision_shot on Bastion from dist~2.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → attack(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 5/8 HP, fortified. No enemies adjacent. Marksman is at (0,4) dist=3 to my west, Viper at (5,4) dist=4 to my east. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Nearest enemy is Marksman at (0,4). I should move toward them. Moving to (1,4) gets me closer to Marksman. After moving I lose fortify, so I should use shield_wall to mitigate incoming damage. Marksman is to my west/northwest, Viper is to the east. Moving west toward Marksman makes sense. From (1,4), Marksman would be at dist=1 (adjacent at (0,4)) - actually (0,4) to (1,4) is distance 1, so I could attack! Let me move to (1,4) then attack Marksman who would be adjacent.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (1,4) distance 4, out of range. Traps already at (4,3), (3,5), (3,4) forming a barrier. I should move closer to threaten with denial and place a trap in a gap. Moving to (4,4) keeps me near existing traps and lets me place a trap at (3,4)... wait, (3,4) already has a trap. I'll move to (4,5) and place a trap at (3,5)... also already trapped. Move to (4,4) and place trap at (5,3) to extend the trap line southward.
  State: Bastion 5/8, Viper 7/9 | Dead: Bolt, Lens, Ghost, Marksman

### Turn 9 — player
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Viper is at (4,4), 3 tiles east. I'm fortified at (1,4). Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. I should move east toward Viper. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer (dist=1) but still not adjacent yet — actually (3,4) would put me 1 tile away from Viper at (4,4), making them adjacent next turn. After moving to (3,4), I lose fortify but get closer. Then use shield_wall facing E toward Viper to protect against incoming attacks.

  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4), wounded. My Denial passive is blocking their abilities right now. I can't place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector... wait, I'm the Vector. Trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not when I'm adjacent to enemies in general. But Bastion is a sentinel, not a vector, so trap should be available. However, I should check: Bastion is at (3,4), I'm at (4,4). Pulse would hit Bastion for 1 damage (within 1 tile AoE). Then I can move to maintain pressure or place a trap. Pulse first to damage the wounded Bastion, then move to (5,4) to reposition slightly while still denying with adjacency... actually staying adjacent keeps Denial active. Let me pulse Bastion for damage, then place a trap at (3,3) or (4,3) to cut off escape routes. (4,3) already has a trap. I'll pulse first, then move to (5,4) to place trap at (4,3)... but (4,3) is already trapped. Move to (5,5) and trap (4,3) won't work since it's already there. Pulse the adjacent Bastion, then move away slightly to place a trap at (3,3) — but I need to be within 2 tiles of the trap target. From (4,4), (3,3) is distance ~1.4, within range 2. I'll pulse first (targeting myself as center of AoE to hit Bastion), then move to (5,4) to reposition.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4), wounded. My Denial passive is already blocking their abilities. I can attack for 1 damage, and pulse would hit them for 1 damage too. Pulse is better since it's AoE and I'm already in range. Then I can move to maintain position or place a trap. Actually, attack + pulse both deal 1 damage. Let me pulse first (hits all within 1 tile = Bastion takes 1), then attack for another 1. That's 2 damage total on a wounded sentinel which should finish or nearly finish them.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 1/8 HP I'm critical. Viper is adjacent at (4,4). I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Denial zone blocks abilities other than basic attack/movement. I should attack Viper directly.
