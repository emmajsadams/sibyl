## Squads
### Player
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Pulse** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are 5 tiles away. I should advance toward the frontline while staying behind my allies. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to support range. No ability targets available this turn.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and TIP. No enemies in range. Move north to close distance toward Longshot (the enemy damage dealer) while cloaked. Moving to (0,3) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying on the west flank.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(3,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move toward (3,3) to advance behind enemy lines while cloaked. Pulse is at (2,3) facing N, so (2,2) is behind them — I can reach that next turn to set up a breach or shadow_strike.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is at dist=2, in range for precision_shot (2dmg). I'm not adjacent to any Vector so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Fire first, then assess repositioning.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Pulse is 2 tiles south at (2,3), moving toward us. I should advance to (2,4) to get adjacent to Pulse and block it from reaching our allies. Moving to (2,4) puts me directly between Pulse and our backline, and gets me adjacent to attack.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far (dist 6-7). I should move forward and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to center while staying near our formation. Then place a trap at (3,3) - a natural chokepoint between enemies at (2,4)/(1,4) and our allies at (0,3)/(2,3). This denies the central corridor.
  State: Phantom 4/4, Pulse 9/12, Snare 9/9, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 5/5, Shade 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → overclock(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with Rampart (enemy sentinel) adjacent at (2,4). All allies are at full HP so no healing needed. I'm blocked from using patch/overclock while adjacent to an enemy Vector — but Snare (my Vector) is an ally, not enemy. Wait, the warning says blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Shade is the enemy specter, not a vector. Let me check: enemies are Rampart(sentinel), Longshot(striker), and Shade(specter) — no enemy Vector listed. So my abilities are free to use. Phantom (specter ally) is at (0,3) dist=2, not adjacent. Snare (vector ally) is at (4,2) dist=3. No allies are adjacent to me right now, so overclock requires adjacency — I can't use it from here. My orders say keep frontliner alive with patch and overclock striker/specter when no healing needed. All allies are full HP. I should move to get adjacent to an ally to overclock them, or stay safe. Moving to (1,3) would get me adjacent to Phantom at (0,3). But Phantom is a specter — overclock on specter could be powerful. Let me move to (1,3) to get adjacent to Phantom, then overclock Phantom.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → breach(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Longshot is the priority target (damage dealer). I can reach (1,5) which is directly behind Longshot at (1,4) facing S. Move to (1,5) first, then use breach on Longshot to make them obey me next turn. Cloak has 1 turn left so I can use abilities without breaking it (shadow_strike keeps cloak, breach breaks cloak but that's acceptable to control the striker).
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(1,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I have two good breach targets: Pulse at (1,3) facing W with behind tile at (2,3), and Snare at (4,2) facing N with behind tile at (4,1). Snare is a vector - I must NOT move adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. Moving to (2,3) puts me behind Pulse and adjacent, enabling breach. Pulse is a medic - high value target to control. I'll move to (2,3) and breach Pulse. This uses my cloak turn productively before it expires.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to stand down and move away from allies. Allies Rampart is at (2,4) and Shade is at (2,3). I'm at (1,4). Valid moves include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,2), (2,5), (3,4). Moving to (3,4) takes me away from allies and toward the open field. Then wait.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,5) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,4) with 50% damage reduction. Phantom is at (1,5) to my NW and Pulse is at (1,3) to my SW — both at distance 2. No enemies are adjacent so I can't attack. Moving to (1,4) would put me adjacent to both Phantom and Pulse, but I'd lose fortify. Better to stay put and use shield_wall to protect allies. Longshot is at (3,4) to my east, Shade is at (2,3) to my south. Phantom is approaching from the north — shield_wall facing N would protect adjacent allies from that direction. I'll stay and shield_wall facing N to intercept Phantom's likely attack on me or adjacent allies.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 3-4, out of range. Shade at (2,3) is closest. I should move toward the enemies and place a trap to intercept their movement. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer while staying safe. Then I'll place a trap at (3,3) — between my position and the enemy cluster — to deny their approach route.
  State: Phantom 3/4, Pulse 9/12, Snare 9/9, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 5/5, Shade 4/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(1,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Pulse is adjacent at (1,3) and I'm already behind them (my position (2,3) is behind Pulse facing W). Breach is on cooldown. Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best play: shadow_strike Pulse for 1 damage since they're adjacent. Then move to (1,4) to get behind Phantom for a breach or shadow_strike next turn. Snare is at dist=2, I must not move adjacent to it.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(1,4) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (1,4) and I'm at (1,5). Shade faces N so I'm behind them — wait, behind check says false, behindTiles=[1,3]. I'm at (1,5) which is SOUTH of Shade facing N, so I'm behind them from a positional standpoint but the check says not behind. Breach cooldown is 1 turn, so can't breach anyway. Priority: orders say assassinate damage dealer (Longshot), but Longshot is dist=3 and not reachable for breach. Shade is right here at dist=1 — I can shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. Wait, am I cloaked? The system says I'm Phantom (specter, A) and it's round 3 — I used cloak on turn 1 (3 turns duration), so cloak may still be active through round 3. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and does 1 damage to adjacent Shade. Then move to (2,5) to get behind Rampart for a breach next turn when cooldown expires.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from team toward edge. My team is to the east/northeast. Edge tiles to west/south are 0,1 or 0,2 or 0,3. Moving to (0,3) gets me to the west edge, away from allies at (2,5) and (3,2). Shade is adjacent at (1,4) so I want to move away. I'll move to (0,1) to go toward corner edge, away from team cluster.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to stand down and move away from allies. Rampart is at (2,4) and Shade is at (1,4). I'm at (3,4). Moving to (5,4) maximizes distance from both allies while also putting distance between me and the nearby Vector at (3,2).
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies are all out of range. I have a trap at (3,3) already. Rampart is at (2,4) moving south, Shade at (1,4) moving north - they could converge through the (2,3)-(3,3) corridor. I should move north to (3,4) to threaten the approach and place another trap at (2,3) to create a double trap corridor. This controls the chokepoint between enemy positions and my allies at (2,5) and (0,1). Moving to (3,4) puts me closer to deny Rampart abilities if they advance.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (2,5) — attack it. Stay put to keep Fortify active (50% damage reduction). No need to move.
  State: Phantom 2/4, Pulse 8/12, Snare 9/9, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 5/5, Shade 3/4

### Turn 4 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team toward the edge. I'm at (0,1) facing S. My team is mostly in the upper area. Moving toward bottom-left corner edge tiles. Best edge move is toward (3,1) or along the bottom row. I'll move to (3,1) which is farthest from team and toward the edge.
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → breach(2,5) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and I'm behind them — (1,5) is reachable, adjacent, and behind. Move to (1,5) then breach Phantom: they're wounded so controlling them next turn could be decisive. Still have 1 breach left after this.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge. I'm at (2,5) with 2HP. Shade is adjacent at (1,5) and Rampart at (2,4) — both dangerous. I can breach Rampart from behind (I'm on their behind tile at 2,5, they face S). But orders say move away from allies. Allies are at (3,1) and (3,3). Map edge options: (0,5) or (5,5) or (0,4). Moving toward map edge means going to (5,5) or far corner. I could move to (3,5) then (5,5)? My mv=3 so I can reach (5,5) in one move. That gets me away from both enemies and toward the far edge. No ability needed if I'm just repositioning. But I should use breach on Rampart since I'm behind them — 1 use of my ability and it would be valuable. However orders say move away. Let me follow orders: move to (5,5) — away from allies at (3,1)/(3,3) and toward map edge. Then wait or shadow_strike isn't possible from there. Just move.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to stand down and move away from allies. Allies are at (2,4) and (1,5), so I should move away from them — toward the southeast. Valid moves that take me away: (5,2) or (5,3) are south. (4,3) also moves away. I'll move to (5,2) to maximize distance from allies at (2,4) and (1,5). Then wait.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) facing N with traps already at (3,3) and (2,3). Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) distance 2 - within my denial aura range. I should place a trap to control the approach path. Moving to (3,4) puts me closer to Rampart and lets me use denial. Then place a trap at (2,4) area or use pulse on Rampart. Actually, Rampart is at dist 2 so pulse (range 1 AoE) won't reach. I should move toward Rampart to get pulse range, or place a trap on their likely movement path. Move to (3,4) brings me adjacent to Rampart at (2,4) - dist would be 1+1=2... wait, from (3,4) to (2,4) is dist 1, that's adjacent! Then I can pulse Rampart. But trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Let me move to (3,5) instead to place a trap at (2,4) or (3,4) to block Rampart's path south. Actually best: move to (4,4) to maintain distance, then trap at (3,4) to block Rampart's southward movement toward our medic.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,4) with 50% damage reduction. Snare is 2 tiles away at (4,4) — moving adjacent would get my abilities blocked. I should hold position to keep fortify active and use shield_wall to protect Longshot at (5,2) from eastern threats. Staying put maintains fortify and lets me use shield_wall facing East toward Phantom and Snare.
  State: Phantom 2/4, Pulse 8/12, Snare 9/9, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 5/5, Shade 3/4

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge. I'm at (5,5) facing E, which is already near the east/top-right corner. Allies are at (3,1) and (4,4). Moving to (5,3) gets me behind Longshot and toward the south edge, away from ally at (4,4). That's a valid move tile and moves me away from both allies while staying near the east edge.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. All enemies are out of range (dist 4-6). Snare is closest at dist 4 with denial aura blocking cloak/breach when adjacent. I'm cloaked and should close distance toward Snare to get in shadow_strike range next turn. Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Snare at (4,4) but that's risky since Snare has denial aura. Better to move to (3,5) to close distance while staying safe, then next turn approach from a better angle. Actually Snare is at (4,4)→N, so behind is (4,3). I can't reach behind tiles this turn. Let me move toward (3,4) which is reachable and puts me dist 1 from Snare — but that's adjacent and I'd be in denial range. Shadow_strike works adjacent and keeps cloak, so I can hit Snare from (3,4). Wait — denial range blocks cloak/breach when adjacent to Vector, but shadow_strike just requires adjacent and keeps cloak. I should move to (3,4) and shadow_strike Snare at (4,4).
- **Pulse** (medic): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from team toward edge. I'm at (3,1). My allies are at (5,3) and (4,4) - northeast. Moving toward the edge away from them means heading south or west. (0,1) or (1,0) would be far from allies. I'll move to (0,1) to get to the west edge, away from the team.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (5,3) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Snare is the vector, not Phantom. Phantom is a specter and is wounded. However, precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and LoS, but deals 1dmg if I moved. Phantom is at dist=1 (adjacent). I need to check: precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Snare is the vector at dist=3, not adjacent, so precision_shot is available. But Phantom is adjacent to me — precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles so dist=1 qualifies. I should move first to (5,4) to get away from adjacency concern and then fire, but wait — moving would reduce precision_shot to 1dmg. Better to fire first at full 2dmg while stationary, then move away from Snare threat. Fire precision_shot at Phantom (5,3) for 2dmg while stationary, then move to (5,4) to keep distance from Snare.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with Longshot adjacent at (5,4) and Shade wounded at (3,4). Rampart is at (2,4) dist 2. My Denial passive blocks adjacent enemies from using some abilities. I should use pulse to hit Longshot and Shade (both within 1 tile), then move to (5,5) or (5,3) to reposition. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of me - that's Longshot at (5,4) and Shade at (3,4), both dist=1. This could finish off wounded Shade and damage Longshot. Then move away to avoid being surrounded.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Shade is critical at (3,4) and needs protection. Snare is the closest threat at (5,5), dist 4. I'm currently fortified at (2,4). Moving toward (3,4) area to shield_wall Shade against Snare coming from the east/north. Moving to (3,5) puts me adjacent to Shade and between Shade and Snare at (5,5). From (3,5) I can shield_wall east to protect Shade from Snare.
  State: Pulse 8/12, Snare 8/9, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 4/5, Shade 1/4 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 6 — player
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is wounded at (5,5) but dist=9, far out of reach. No allies are adjacent to heal or overclock. All enemies are out of range. I should advance toward Snare to get in healing range. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer. No abilities available this turn.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Breach is exhausted (2/2). No enemies in range. Snare at (5,5) is 3 tiles away — must avoid adjacency or abilities get blocked. Pulse at (3,1) is 3 tiles away facing E. I need to close distance on Pulse for a shadow_strike without getting killed. Moving to (3,2) puts me 1 tile from Pulse and I can shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked — but wait, I used cloak already and it's been several turns. Checking: no cloak active indicated in status. I'm uncloaked at 1HP. Best play: move toward Pulse to get adjacent for shadow_strike. Moving to (3,2) gets me adjacent to Pulse at (3,1). Then shadow_strike keeps me hidden-ish (no cloak active though). Actually shadow_strike does 1dmg at adjacent range — I should take the shot while I can. Move to (3,2) then shadow_strike Pulse at (3,1).
- **Longshot** (striker): attack(5,5) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Adjacent to Snare's denial zone, precision_shot is blocked. Only basic attack or movement works here. Snare is healthy at dist=1, Pulse is wounded but out of range. Best play: attack Snare with basic attack (1dmg), then move away to (4,3) to break out of denial zone. Next turn I can use precision_shot on Pulse if repositioned.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (3,5) with 50% damage reduction. Shade is critical at (3,2) and needs protection. Snare is 2 tiles away at (5,5) — must avoid moving adjacent. No enemies in melee range. Best play: stay fortified to maintain damage reduction, use shield_wall toward the south to protect Shade from Pulse's direction. Moving would break fortify. Wait preserves the fortify bonus while shield_wall covers Shade.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → pulse(5,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at dist=2, so I can't use trap (blocked by Denial when adjacent to enemy Vector? No - trap is blocked when I'm adjacent to enemy Vector, not when enemy is adjacent to me). Actually re-reading: 'trap blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' - I am Vector, so trap is blocked if I'm adjacent to an enemy. Rampart is at (3,5) and I'm at (5,5), dist=2 so not adjacent. I can place a trap. Longshot at (4,3) is the main threat moving toward my ally at (3,1). I should move to (4,4) to get closer and place a trap on (4,3) or along the path between enemies and ally. Moving to (4,4) puts me dist=1 from Rampart which would block my trap. Better to stay at (5,5) and place trap at (4,4) to block Longshot's path, or move to (5,3) and trap (4,3) where Longshot currently stands. Actually Longshot is at (4,3) - if I place trap there it won't trigger until they move back onto it. Better to trap a chokepoint they'll move through. Place trap at (4,4) - between Rampart/Longshot and my ally. Stay put and trap (4,4) as a chokepoint, then pulse Rampart who is in range.
  State: Pulse 7/12, Snare 7/9, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 4/5, Shade 1/4 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,1) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically wounded. Pulse is adjacent at (3,1) and wounded. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage - if Pulse is wounded, this could finish them. I can't use breach (limit reached). Move to (2,1) to get behind Pulse, then shadow_strike for the kill. Wait - I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike still works (just deals 1dmg at adjacent range). Best play: shadow_strike Pulse now from current position (adjacent, dist=1), potentially finishing them off. I'm at 1HP so I need to eliminate the threat fast.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is critical and adjacent (dist=2) at (2,2). I'm at (3,1). My ally Snare needs healing but is dist=6, unreachable. Shade is an enemy specter so I shouldn't heal them. No allies are adjacent. Longshot is approaching at (4,3), dist=3. I should move away from danger and position to support. Moving to (4,0) keeps me safer and away from Shade. No adjacent allies to heal or overclock, so I'll wait after moving.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,0) ✓
  💭 Pulse is wounded and in range at dist=3. precision_shot has range ≤2 tiles, so I need to close to range 2. Moving to (4,1) puts me 1 tile from Pulse at (4,0) — that's adjacent, and precision_shot requires non-adjacent to Vector but Snare is at (5,5) which is far. Actually dist to Pulse from (4,1) is 1 tile, within range 2, so precision_shot works. I haven't moved this turn so no damage penalty — 2dmg would finish wounded Pulse. Let me move to (4,1) first, then fire precision_shot at Pulse.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,5) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is 2 tiles away at (5,5) - I must NOT move adjacent to avoid ability denial. I'm fortified (50% DR) which is valuable. Shade is critical at (2,2) and needs protection. I should hold position to maintain fortify bonus and use shield_wall to protect allies. Moving would break fortify. Best play: stay put, use shield_wall toward the east/south to protect Shade from Snare's threat direction.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(5,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at dist=2, within my denial aura range. I should use pulse to hit Rampart for 1 damage since they're within 1 tile... wait, pulse hits ALL within 1 tile and Rampart is at dist=2, so not in pulse range. Rampart is at (3,5) and I'm at (5,5), dist=2. Attack range is adjacent only (dist=1), so I can't attack. Trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy - Rampart at dist=2 means not directly adjacent, so trap should be available. I should place a trap to control the approach. (4,4) is already trapped. I can move to (4,5) to get closer and use denial on Rampart, or stay and place a trap. Valid moves include (4,5) which puts me at dist=1 from Rampart (3,5) - that triggers denial. Let me move to (4,5) to put Rampart in my denial zone (blocking their abilities), then place a trap at a chokepoint. From (4,5), I can trap tiles within 2 range. But wait - if I move adjacent to Rampart, trap gets blocked. So I should trap first, then move. Place trap at a useful tile first from current pos (5,5), then move to (4,5). Good tile: Longshot is coming from (4,1) direction - trap at (5,3) or (5,4) to block southern approach. (4,4) already trapped. Place trap at (5,3) to cover southern corridor, then move to (4,5) to deny Rampart abilities.
  State: Pulse 5/12, Snare 7/9, Rampart 8/8, Longshot 4/5, Shade 1/4 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 8 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no breach available. Pulse is wounded at (4,0) facing S - priority target. I need to close distance. Moving toward (4,2) or (3,1) to get adjacent to Pulse next turn. Moving to (3,1) puts me 2 tiles from Pulse at (4,0), then shadow_strike next turn. Let me move aggressively toward Pulse - move to (3,0) via (3,1) path. Valid moves include (3,1) and (3,0). I'll move to (3,1) to close gap, then shadow_strike Pulse if adjacent.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,0) with 5/12 HP, heavily wounded. Longshot is adjacent at (4,1) threatening me. I need to escape and survive. Moving to (5,0) gets me away from Longshot while staying on the board. I can't heal myself (patch only works on allies), and I can't attack effectively. Best move: reposition away from Longshot to avoid further damage. No adjacent allies to heal or overclock. I'll move to (3,0) to put distance from Longshot and potentially regroup.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is wounded and in range at (3,0), distance 2. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2 damage. No adjacent enemies blocking the shot. Fire precision_shot on Pulse to finish them off, then wait.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (4,5) and I'm in its DENIAL zone — only basic attack works. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Shade is critical at (4,2) and needs protection. I should attack Snare to eliminate the denial zone threat, then stay put to maintain fortify bonus and shield_wall isn't available due to denial. Attack Snare now.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,5) - I'm denying their abilities which is valuable. I can't place traps when adjacent to an enemy Vector... wait, I'm Vector and Rampart is a sentinel, not a vector. My passive denies adjacent enemies from using certain abilities. I should pulse Rampart for 1 damage to all units within 1 tile of me - but Rampart is at dist=1 so they'd be hit. Check if pulse hits allies too - yes it hits ALL units within 1 tile. Pulse at my current position (4,5) hits Rampart at (3,5). Then I could move to (4,4) or (5,5) to get distance. Actually, pulse first then move away. Or I can try to place a trap. Rampart is adjacent so trap is blocked? The warning says trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - I am Vector, but adjacent enemy is Rampart (sentinel), not a Vector. So trap should be available. I could pulse Rampart (1dmg) then place a trap on (4,4) to block their path. Actually (4,4) already has a trap. Let me place on (5,4) or (3,4). Pulse first to hit Rampart, then move to (5,5) to maintain denial pressure while escaping slightly.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical priority is to eliminate Pulse (also critical HP) before it heals. I can move to (4,0) which is behind Pulse and adjacent, then shadow_strike for the kill. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I have it, but regardless this eliminates the enemy medic. Move to (4,0), then shadow_strike Pulse.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/12 HP — critically low. Shade is adjacent at (4,0) and critical. No allies adjacent to heal or overclock. I need to survive: move away from enemies. Moving to (2,1) puts distance between me and Shade/Longshot. I can't heal anyone adjacent. Best play: reposition to safety.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Pulse is critical and at distance 2 - perfect range for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved yet so full damage applies. I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector (Snare is at dist 5), so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire first, then wait or reposition.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (3,5) distance 2 - in range but not adjacent so denial is active. I already have traps at (4,4) and (5,3). I can move to (4,5) to get closer to Rampart and potentially deny abilities, or stay and place another trap. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (3,5), enabling full denial. Then I can place a trap at (3,4) to cut off Rampart's southern movement, or pulse if useful. Let me move to (4,5) first to be adjacent to Rampart (enabling denial), then place a trap at (3,4) to block escape routes.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare at (4,5) with DENIAL active, so only basic attack and movement work. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and have 7/8 HP. Snare is healthy and right next to me. I should attack Snare since I'm in melee range, and stay put to maintain fortify bonus. Moving would lose fortify. Attack then wait.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. Snare is at (4,5) wounded but dist=5, out of my reach this turn. Allies Longshot at (4,1) and Rampart at (3,5) are healthy. I should move toward Snare to close distance while staying alive. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer. No enemies in range this turn so I'll advance to position for shadow_strike next round.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (4,5) wounded, dist=4, out of my range 2. Need to move closer. Moving to (4,3) would get me to dist=2 but Shade is there (critical). Move to (3,3) to get closer while avoiding Shade's tile. From (3,3) Snare at (4,5) is dist=sqrt(1+4)~2.2 - still out of range 2. Move north to (4,2): dist to Snare=(0+9)=3, still out. Best move is (3,2): dist to Snare=(1+9)=sqrt(10)~3.16, still out. Actually range is tile distance (Chebyshev or Manhattan?). Snare at (4,5), I'm at (4,1), Manhattan dist=4. Moving to (4,2) gives dist=3, still out of range 2. Moving to (4,3) would give dist=2 but Shade is there. Move to (3,2): Manhattan to (4,5)=|3-4|+|2-5|=1+3=4, still out. Move to (5,2): dist=|5-4|+|2-5|=1+3=4. Move to (3,3) would be outside my mv2 range from (4,1). Max I can get is (4,2) for dist=3. No shot this turn. Move toward Snare, wait for next turn.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (4,5) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. The DENIAL zone blocks abilities other than basic attack/movement, so I should just attack. Shade is critical and needs protection. Attacking the wounded Snare could finish it off.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,5) - my Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. Shade is critical at (4,3) and in range. I should pulse to hit both Rampart (dist=1) and potentially Shade (dist=2 - outside pulse's 1-tile AoE). Actually pulse only hits within 1 tile, so only Rampart. Shade is critical - attack would finish them if I can reach. But Shade is at dist=2, attack requires adjacent. I can move to (4,4) which is in my valid moves, then from (4,4) Shade at (4,3) would be adjacent - I can attack for 1dmg to finish critical Shade. But wait - trap at (4,4) already exists. Let me reconsider. Valid moves include (4,4) but there's already a trap there - can I move onto my own trap? Better to pulse Rampart now (they're adjacent), then consider movement. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Rampart at (3,5) is dist=1, so pulse hits them for 1dmg. Then I could move to (5,4) to reposition away from Rampart while staying near traps. Or move first to (5,5) then pulse won't reach Rampart. Best: pulse first (hits Rampart), then move to (5,4) to dodge while Rampart is weakened.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so I need to be very careful. Snare (vector) is at (5,4) facing S, wounded. I can't use breach (limit reached). Moving to (4,4) gets me adjacent to Snare but that's risky at 1HP. However, Snare is wounded — if I can shadow_strike it, I might finish it off. (5,5) is behind Snare and adjacent. I should move to (4,4) first then shadow_strike Snare at (5,4) — wait, (4,4) is adjacent to (5,4) so shadow_strike would work from there. But being adjacent to a Vector blocks cloak/breach — those aren't options anyway. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I'm cloaked, but I'm not cloaked. At 1HP I'm very fragile. Let me move to (4,4) which is adjacent to Snare and use shadow_strike for 1 damage — if Snare is wounded it might be killable. The risk is Snare attacks back and I die. But Snare goes after me in order (spd1 vs my spd3), so I act first this round. I'll shadow_strike from (4,4).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,4) ✓
  💭 Snare is wounded at (5,4), dist=3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 exceeds range 2). Need to close to range ≤2. Move to (5,3) gets dist=1 from Snare — too close, adjacent denial. Move to (4,4) gives dist=1 to (5,4) — also adjacent. Move to (3,3) gives dist to (5,4) = sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, not adjacent. Move to (5,3): dist to (5,4)=1, adjacent — blocked. Move to (4,3): dist to (5,4) = sqrt(1+1)=1.41, diagonal adjacent — likely counts as adjacent. Move to (3,4) not in valid tiles. Best option: stay at (4,2), dist=3 to (5,4) — out of precision_shot range 2. Move to (5,2): dist to (5,4)=2, not adjacent (dist>1), precision_shot valid from there. Fire precision_shot at (5,4) from (5,2) — but moved so 1dmg. That should finish wounded Snare. Moving to (5,2) keeps distance>1 (dist=2, not adjacent).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (5,4), distance 3. Currently fortified at (3,5). Longshot is at (5,2) to the south-east. I need to hold the front line and position between allies and enemies. Moving to (4,4) closes distance to Snare while staying out of adjacent range (dist would be 2). But warning says avoid moving adjacent — dist 3 is safe. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist 2 from Snare, still not adjacent. That keeps fortify if I don't move... but I should advance. Move to (4,4) to close in, then wait to re-establish fortify next turn. Actually, staying fortified gives 50% damage reduction which is valuable at 6/8 HP. Hold position and wait to maintain fortify.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with only 2HP - critically low. Longshot is at (5,2) distance 2, in range. I need to either escape or deal damage. Moving to (4,5) gets me away from Longshot while staying viable. There's already a trap at (5,3) between me and Longshot which is good. I should place a trap at (4,4) or move to create distance. Actually, I can pulse Longshot from current position - it hits all within 1 tile, and Longshot is at distance 2 so out of pulse range. Let me place a trap between us. (5,3) already has a trap. I can move to (4,5) to escape and place a trap at (4,4) to control that approach. Wait - valid moves include (4,5) and (4,4) is listed as valid move too. Let me move to (4,5) for safety and place trap at (4,4) to deny approach.
