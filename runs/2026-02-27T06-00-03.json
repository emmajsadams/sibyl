From (4,4) I'd be adjacent to Lattice at (4,5) — I can shadow_strike (1dmg, keeps cloak). Lattice is wounded, so this might finish it. But wait — moving adjacent to a Vector blocks abilities. The caution says 'avoid moving adjacent or abilities will be blocked.' So I cannot shadow_strike if adjacent to vector. I'm stuck — I can't get close enough to shadow_strike without being adjacent to the vector which blocks abilities. Best play: move to (3,4) to pressure, then wait or shadow_strike if possible. Actually from (3,4), Lattice is at (4,5) — distance is sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 tiles, which is diagonal adjacent. Shadow_strike requires adjacent. But vector denial blocks adjacent abilities. I cannot use shadow_strike on vector at all when adjacent. My only option is attack (breaks cloak) from adjacent, but at 1HP that's suicidal.
