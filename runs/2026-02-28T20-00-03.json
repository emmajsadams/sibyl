Wraith is adjacent (dist=1) so I need to move away first to use precision_shot safely, OR use suppressing_fire/attack. Actually, checking the rule: precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically - Wraith is a specter, so precision_shot should work but will deal 1dmg if I moved. I have OVERCLOCKED (2 ability uses). Best plan: move to (3,1) to get dist=2 from Wraith at (2,0), then use precision_shot twice on Wraith (2dmg each if not moved... but I moved so 1dmg each). Wait - if I move first, precision_shot deals 1dmg. If I use abilities first without moving, I'm adjacent which is dist=1, still in range<=2. Precision_shot needs LoS and range<=2, no Vector adjacency restriction. So I can fire twice from current position at Wraith for 2dmg each = 4dmg total to kill Wraith. Then I don't need to move.
