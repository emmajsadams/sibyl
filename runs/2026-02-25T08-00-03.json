If I move to (3,3), Lens at (3,2) would be dist=1, in range. But if I move first, precision_shot deals 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Better to shoot first, then move. But Lens is at dist=3 from current position — out of precision_shot range (≤2). So I must move first to get in range. Move to (3,3) puts Lens at dist=1. Then use precision_shot for 1dmg (moved penalty). With overclocked I have 2 ability uses — use precision_shot twice on Lens for 1+1=2dmg total. That would kill a healthy Lens (assuming 3-4HP). Actually let me reconsider: move to (4,3) puts me at dist=2 from Lens at (3,2) — still in range, closer. Or (3,3) is dist=1. Either way I moved so it's 1dmg per shot. Two shots = 2dmg. Worth doing.",
