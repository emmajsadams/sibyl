## Squads
### Player
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Seer** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
### Opponent
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(3,0) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are 5+ tiles away, no threat yet. After cloaking, advance north toward Lens (the oracle/priority target) and Hawk. Moving to (3,3) puts me 2 tiles closer while staying cloaked.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist 5 and 7, max range 4). I should advance south to close distance. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to Marksman at (2,1) — dist would be 2, well within scan range. I'll move aggressively toward the enemies to enable scanning next turn.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Lens is exactly at scan range (dist=4). I should scan Lens to reveal its strategy and deal 1 damage. Wraith and Marksman are forward - I can recalibrate Marksman after scanning but Marksman is at (2,1) which is dist=2, not adjacent. I'll scan Lens first, then move north to get better position while staying behind allies.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(1,0) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is at distance 2 — highest priority target per orders (medics/support first). I'm at (2,1), Lens is at (3,2). Not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. I can fire precision_shot at Lens for 2dmg without moving (preserving full damage). After shooting, I'll move away to maintain distance from Lens.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,2) ✓
  💭 Seer (oracle) is in range at dist 3, which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). Wait — dist 3 means 3 tiles away, but precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. So Seer is out of precision_shot range from current position. I need to move closer. Moving to (2,2) brings me to dist 1 from Seer at (1,2), which is within range 2. But I need to check if moving would reduce damage to 1dmg. I moved, so precision_shot would do 1dmg. Alternatively, I can use ability first then move — ability first at current position: Seer is at dist 3, still out of range 2. I need to close to ≤2 tiles. Moving to (2,3) puts me at dist 2 from Seer (1,2): |2-1|+|3-2|=1+1=2, within range. If I move first then shoot, shot does 1dmg (moved). If I shoot first, Seer is at dist 3 — still out of range. So I must move first. Move to (2,3) for dist 2, then precision_shot for 1dmg. Or move to (1,3) for dist 1+1=2, same result. Orders say medics first — oracle is high value. 1dmg on a healthy target is acceptable.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with Hawk at (2,3) and Lens wounded at (3,2). Seer is at (1,2) distance 3, Marksman at (1,0) distance 5. I need to advance and position between allies and enemies. Moving to (1,3) puts me directly between Seer and my allies, blocking the threat. If I stay put after moving I lose Fortify but positioning is priority. I'll move to (1,3) to intercept Seer's advance path, then wait to potentially use Fortify next turn if I don't need to move again.
  State: Marksman 3/3, Seer 9/10, Wraith 4/4, Hawk 3/3, Bastion 12/12, Lens 6/10

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Lens (wounded oracle) at my current position (3,3) — Lens faces S so (3,3) is behind them. I can shadow_strike Lens to finish them off while staying cloaked. Then I have movement left — I could move to (2,4) to get behind Hawk for a future breach. Shadow_strike first since I'm already adjacent and behind Lens.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(1,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Seer scanned me last turn and is now at (1,2) facing N — they're a priority target to disrupt. Seer is only dist=2, well within scan range. Scanning Seer reveals their prompt and deals damage (now at reduced HP). Marksman targeted me with precision_shot last turn and moved to (1,0) — dist=4, also in scan range but Seer is higher priority (closer, already damaged me via scan intel). I'll scan Seer first to expose their prompt and deal damage. Then I can move to (3,3) to reposition slightly north, staying behind my frontline (Hawk@2,3, Bastion@1,3) and maintaining distance from the enemy cluster.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent (dist=1) — scan is blocked for adjacent? No, scan requires ≤4 tiles but is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not sentinel. Bastion is a sentinel, so scan should work. Hawk is highest priority unscanned target. Foresight shows Hawk moved to (2,3) and targeted (1,2) with precision_shot — that's me. I need to avoid being at (1,2) next turn. I should move first to get out of Hawk's line of fire, then scan Hawk to reveal his prompt. Moving to (0,2) keeps distance from Bastion and avoids Hawk's shot. From (0,2), Hawk at (2,3) is dist=3, still in scan range (≤4). Bastion at (1,3) is dist=2, still in scan range. I'll move to (0,3) to increase distance from Bastion (who is at 1,3 — adjacent) and still keep scan range on Hawk. Actually (0,3) puts me at dist=2 from Bastion and dist=3 from Hawk. Good. Scan Hawk to reveal strategy.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(0,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with only 1HP — critically low. Seer (oracle) is at (0,3), dist=2, in range. Orders say medics/oracles first. I can fire precision_shot on Seer for 2dmg. I haven't moved yet so full damage applies. Seer is not adjacent so no Vector block. After shooting, I should move away to maintain distance and survive — move to (3,4) to create more space from Seer at (0,3).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel) is at dist 3, in range. Orders say medics first then damage dealers. Bastion is a sentinel (tank), not a medic, but it's the only target in range. Hawk and Lens are out of range. I'm at (1,0) with 3HP. Bastion is at (1,3), dist 3 — that's outside my precision_shot range of ≤2 tiles. Need to move closer. If I move to (1,2), Bastion is at dist 1 (adjacent) — but that triggers the Vector adjacency warning? Bastion is a sentinel, not a Vector. So precision_shot should work if I move to (1,2) and Bastion is at (1,1)... wait, Bastion is at (1,3). From (1,2), dist to (1,3) = 1, which is adjacent. precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles and needs LoS. Adjacent is within range 2. But if I move first, precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2. Orders say maintain distance, so I should try to shoot without moving closer if possible. From current pos (1,0), Bastion at (1,3) is dist 3 — out of range 2. I need to move to get in range. Moving to (1,2) puts me at dist 1 from Bastion — that's adjacent, meaning I risk melee exposure but precision_shot still works (1dmg since I moved). Alternative: move to (1,1), dist to Bastion = 2, within range, 1dmg since I moved. Or stay and wait — but Bastion is out of range. Best option: move to (1,1) to get Bastion in range at dist 2, fire precision_shot for 1dmg. This maintains some distance vs going to (1,2).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is adjacent at (0,3) — attack it while fortified. No need to move, preserving Fortify bonus.
  State: Marksman 3/3, Seer 4/10, Wraith 4/4, Hawk 1/3, Bastion 11/12, Lens 5/10

### Turn 3 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → scan(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (1,3) — scan is blocked only by enemy Vectors, and Bastion is a sentinel, so scan should work. But Bastion is dist=1, within scan range. However, I'm at 4/10 HP and Bastion attacked me last turn. Priority: scan Bastion to reveal its prompt (not yet scanned), then move away to safety. Foresight shows Bastion will attack (0,3) again this turn — I should move FIRST to avoid that attack. Moving to (0,4) or (1,4) puts distance from Bastion. If I move first to (1,4), Bastion is now dist=1 still... Let me move to (0,5) — dist from Bastion becomes 2+, safe. Then scan Bastion from (0,5): dist to (1,3) = 1+2 = 3, within range 4. That works. Scan Bastion to get its prompt.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Hawk is adjacent but I'm not behind them. Orders say prioritize enemy damage dealer (Hawk=striker, wounded). I can move to (3,3) behind Hawk... wait, Lens is at (3,3). I can breach Bastion from (1,4) which is behind them, but orders say prioritize damage dealers. Lens is wounded oracle at (3,3), reachable behind via (3,2). Best play: move to (3,2) to get behind Lens (wounded oracle = damage dealer), then shadow_strike to stay cloaked and deal damage.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,2) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Wraith is a specter not a vector, so scan should work. However, Wraith at dist=1 is a threat. Foresight shows Wraith used shadow_strike last turn toward (3,2) then moved to (2,4) — so Wraith is moving away. Marksman is targeting Bastion at (1,3) with precision_shot. I should scan Wraith to reveal its prompt and deal 1 damage, then move away to safety. Moving to (4,4) keeps me at range and away from Wraith.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/3 HP — critical. Wraith is at distance 2, wounded, and in range. Orders say precision_shot high-value targets. Wraith is a specter (flanker/assassin class), wounded, and adjacent enough to threaten me. I should shoot Wraith with precision_shot (2dmg would finish a wounded specter), then move away to maintain distance and stay alive. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. After shooting, retreat to (4,5) or (5,4) to open distance from Wraith.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel) is at distance 2, in range for precision_shot. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers — Bastion is a sentinel (tank), not a medic, but it's the only target in range. Hawk and Lens are out of range. I should shoot Bastion with precision_shot (2dmg) since I haven't moved yet (full damage), then move away to maintain distance. Moving to (0,0) or (2,0) keeps distance from Bastion at (1,3). I'll shoot first then reposition south.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (1,3) with 50% damage reduction. Both allies are wounded - Hawk at (5,4) and Lens at (4,4). Enemies: Seer at (0,5) dist=3, Marksman at (2,0) dist=4. Neither enemy is in attack range. I should stay fortified (not move) to maintain damage reduction and use shield_wall to protect wounded allies. Lens is at (4,4) to my east/northeast - but shield_wall protects adjacent allies. Neither ally is adjacent. My best play is to move toward the center to better intercept threats while positioning between allies and enemies. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer to Marksman at (2,0) and maintains a defensive line. But moving loses Fortify. Better to wait and maintain fortification since no enemies are adjacent and I can't attack anyway.
  State: Marksman 3/3, Seer 4/10, Hawk 1/3, Bastion 9/12, Lens 4/10 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 4 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → scan(1,3) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned. Bastion is in range at dist 3. Marksman is my ally damage dealer at (2,0). I should recalibrate Marksman to boost effectiveness, but Marksman is at (2,0) and recalibrate requires adjacent range — too far. I could move toward Marksman, but that risks getting closer to Bastion. Best play: move to (2,4) to stay safe and get closer to Marksman for potential next-turn recalibrate, then scan Bastion for 1 damage since all enemies are already known — actually scan still deals damage even if prompt known. Bastion is healthy and threatening. I'm at 4HP so staying safe is priority. Move to (2,4) then scan Bastion at (1,3) — dist from (2,4) to (1,3) is 2, within range 4. This damages Bastion and keeps me safe.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded at (2,4), distance 2 — within scan range. Seer's prompt is already known, so scanning again gives 1 damage + no new intel value (prompt already revealed). Still worth scanning to chip away at wounded Seer. Marksman is out of range at dist 6. Foresight shows Seer planned to move to (0,5) and scan Bastion — I should scan Seer now to deal damage. After scanning, I can move closer or hold. Move to (3,4) first to stay safe and maintain range, then scan Seer at dist 3.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Seer is at critical HP and in range at dist=3. I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot will deal 2dmg — enough to finish off a critical target. Stay in place and shoot Seer to eliminate the oracle.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(1,1) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (closest is Bastion at dist 4, my range is 2). Need to close distance. Bastion is at (1,3), dist 4 — moving toward it. Best move is toward (3,1) or (4,0) to get closer to the cluster near (3,4). Actually Bastion at (1,3) is closest at dist 4. Moving to (3,1) gets me to dist=3 from Bastion, still out of range but closer. Move to (4,0) gets me closer to Lens at (3,4), dist would be ~4. Let me move maximally toward Bastion: from (2,0) move to (3,1) — that's dist 2 moves, valid. From (3,1) Bastion at (1,3) is dist=4 still. Better to move toward Lens at (3,4): from (2,0) to (4,0) dist=2, then Lens at (3,4) dist=5 still. All targets remain out of range after any move. Best option: move toward Bastion at (1,3) — move to (1,1) which is dist=2 from current, gets me to dist=2 from Bastion. Wait, (1,1) to (1,3) = dist 2, that puts Bastion in range! Move to (1,1) then use precision_shot on Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (1,3) with 50% damage reduction. Seer is critical at (2,4) distance 2 - if I move to (2,3) I can be adjacent to attack. Marksman is at (1,1) distance 2 threatening. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Seer to finish them, and I stay between allies and enemies. After moving I lose fortify but attacking Seer could eliminate a threat.
  State: Marksman 3/3, Seer 1/10, Hawk 1/3, Bastion 7/12, Lens 4/10 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 5 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely vulnerable. Bastion attacked me last turn (adjacent at 2,3) and Lens scanned me. I need to survive. Bastion is adjacent and wounded, Lens is adjacent and wounded. I cannot scan while adjacent to enemy vectors — but these are sentinel and oracle, not vectors. I should move away from Bastion to avoid another attack. Moving to (1,4) puts distance from Bastion (2,3) and Lens (3,4). Then I can scan Hawk at dist 3 from new position — wait, Hawk is already scanned. All enemies are already scanned. I should recalibrate Marksman at (1,1) — but that's not adjacent to my current or any reachable position this turn. Priority: SURVIVE. Move to (0,4) to escape Bastion's adjacent attack range, then scan is pointless since all enemies known. I'll move away and wait.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → attack(0,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is critical and in range at dist=3. Scanning Seer again would be wasted (already scanned). I should attack Seer to finish them off since they're critical — but attack is adjacent only and Seer is at dist=3. I can't reach adjacent to Seer in one move (would need to go to (1,4) which is dist=2 from me, still not adjacent to Seer at (0,4)). Wait — valid moves include (1,4), and from (1,4) Seer at (0,4) would be adjacent (dist=1). So I can move to (1,4) then attack Seer to finish them. But Foresight shows Seer is moving to (2,4) next turn — so their position will change. Actually Foresight shows last turn actions, not future. Seer is currently at (0,4), critical. I can move to (1,4) and then attack (0,4) to eliminate Seer. This eliminates a scanner threat. Let me check: (1,4) is in valid moves list. From (1,4), Seer at (0,4) is dist=1, adjacent. Attack works.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. Marksman is 7 tiles away and out of range. No enemies in range to shoot. I should reposition to maintain distance and stay alive. Moving to (4,5) keeps me further from Marksman while staying near allies.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,4) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is the highest priority target - medics/support first per orders. Both Lens and Bastion are in range at dist=3, which exceeds my range of 2 for precision_shot. I need to close distance. Moving to (1,3) puts me at dist=1 from Lens at (1,4) - within range 2. From (1,3), Lens is at dist=1, Bastion at dist=2 - both in range. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Target Lens first (oracle = high value).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is adjacent at (1,3). I'm fortified (50% DR) and healthy enough to hold. Attack the Marksman directly, then wait to keep fortify bonus next turn.
  State: Marksman 2/3, Hawk 1/3, Bastion 7/12, Lens 3/10 | Dead: Seer, Wraith
