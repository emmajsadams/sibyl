## Squads
### Player
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Grid** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(3,0) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move forward toward enemy lines, advancing up the right flank toward Phantom at (4,5). Moving to (4,2) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying safe under cloak.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(4,5) ✓ → move(4,2) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move south toward enemies. Enemies are at (1,0) and (2,1), both far away. I'll cloak first, then advance toward (4,2) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range at dist=5. I need to advance to get within range 2 for precision_shot. Moving to (1,2) gets me 3 tiles closer to Deadeye at (2,4) - dist becomes 3, still out of range but better positioned. Valid moves include (1,2) which pushes me north toward enemies while staying somewhat protected. I'll move to (1,2) to close distance.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, both enemies at dist=3 which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles? No — range is ≤2 tiles, dist=3 is OUT of range). I need to close to range 2. I'm at (2,4), Deadeye is at (1,2) dist=3, Grid(vector) is at (2,1) dist=3. Grid is a vector — must avoid being adjacent to it or precision_shot gets blocked. Moving to (2,2) would put me dist=1 from Grid at (2,1) — too close. Moving to (1,3) puts me dist=2 from Deadeye(1,2) and dist=2 from Grid(2,1). That's within precision_shot range for Deadeye but Grid is also at dist=2 — not adjacent so abilities not blocked. Fire precision_shot at Deadeye from (1,3).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → shield_wall(1,4) S ✓
  💭 Move forward aggressively toward enemy Deadeye at (1,2). From (1,5) I can move to (1,4) to close distance. Enemies are not in range yet. Set up shield_wall facing South to protect Deadeye ally behind me, but orders say push forward and face enemy cluster. Move to (1,4) to advance, then shield_wall facing South (toward enemy Deadeye at dist 2 from new position) — wait, enemy Deadeye is to the South of me. From (1,4), Deadeye is at (1,2) which is South. Shield_wall facing S to block incoming fire on myself or adjacent allies.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Enemies are at (1,3) and (1,4), approaching from the north. I should move north to intercept and place a trap in their path. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer but I can place a trap at (1,3) or (2,3) to catch the enemy Deadeye advancing south. Best play: move to (2,3) then place trap at (1,3) — directly in enemy Deadeye's current position path. Wait, enemy Deadeye is already at (1,3). I should trap a tile they'll move through. Move to (2,2) first to get closer, then trap (1,3) where enemy Deadeye stands or (2,3) ahead of Aegis. Actually trap at (2,3) — between me and approaching enemies, in their likely advance path toward my allies at (1,2) and (4,2).
  State: Deadeye 4/5, Wraith 4/4, Grid 9/9, Aegis 8/8, Phantom 4/4, Deadeye 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — must use it wisely. Both enemies are out of range (dist 4-5) and behind tiles are unreachable this turn. I need to close distance while cloaked. Deadeye at (1,3) facing S means behind tile is (1,4), which is occupied by Aegis. Aegis at (1,4) facing S means behind tile is (1,5). Neither is reachable this turn. Best move: advance toward enemies using max movement. Move to (3,3) — closes distance to Deadeye to 2, positioning for breach or shadow_strike next turn from behind. After cloak expires next turn I'll be in position to strike.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak has only 1 turn remaining — it will expire after this turn. No enemies are in range from current position. I need to close the gap. Wraith is the closest at dist 3, at (3,3) facing N — behind tile is (3,2). I can move to (3,4) this turn, putting me adjacent to Wraith and within reach to get behind next turn. But cloak expires after this turn, so I need to be in position to strike NOW or next turn. Moving to (3,4) puts me 1 tile from Wraith at (3,3) — that's adjacent, so I could shadow_strike from there while still cloaked. Shadow_strike range is adjacent only. (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3). Let me move to (3,4) and then shadow_strike Wraith at (3,3) — this uses cloak's last turn but shadow_strike doesn't break cloak, so I stay cloaked through the hit.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → move(0,1) ✓
  💭 Deadeye enemy is adjacent at (1,3) - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy (but Deadeye is a striker, not vector, so check: precision_shot blocked by adjacent enemy Vector specifically). Deadeye is a striker, not vector, so precision_shot should work. But Deadeye is at dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles with LoS. However, the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - Deadeye is a striker, so no block. But if I fire precision_shot at Deadeye (dist=1), I deal 2dmg if I haven't moved. Better to move away first to avoid being adjacent, but moving would reduce precision_shot to 1dmg. Best: fire precision_shot at Deadeye first (2dmg, no move penalty), then move away. Deadeye has 4HP so won't kill but deals good damage. Actually, let me target Aegis at (1,4) dist=2 for 2dmg instead - same damage but Aegis is sentinel (tankier). Deadeye is the more dangerous threat adjacent to me. Hit Deadeye with precision_shot for 2dmg, then move away to (2,2) or (0,1) to create distance.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → precision_shot(0,1) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid (vector) at (2,3) which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away from Grid's denial zone first. Moving to (0,3) puts me 2 tiles from Grid, clearing denial. From (0,3), Wraith at (3,3) is dist=3 (out of range for precision_shot). Moving to (0,4) keeps distance from Grid. Let me check (2,2) - that's dist=1 from Grid still close. Best move is (0,3) to escape denial and get away from threats. From (0,3), Wraith is at dist=3 (out of range). Deadeye is at (0,1), dist=2 - in range! Can use precision_shot on Deadeye after moving to (0,3). Wait - if I move I deal 1dmg with precision_shot. Deadeye is healthy (4HP), so 1dmg is worth it. Move to (0,3) then precision_shot Deadeye at (0,1).
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(1,3) ✓
  💭 Three enemies in range: Aegis at (1,4), Phantom at (3,4), Deadeye at (0,3) wounded. My ally Deadeye is at (0,1) wounded, Wraith at (3,3). Enemy Deadeye at (0,3) is adjacent to my ally Deadeye and threatens them. I should place a trap between enemy positions to punish movement. Moving to (2,4) keeps me central and puts me adjacent to both Phantom and Aegis for Denial. But trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - no enemy Vectors here so trap is fine. Place trap at (1,3) to catch enemy Deadeye movement or Aegis advancing. Actually, enemy Deadeye is wounded at (0,3) - a trap at (1,2) could cut off retreat. Better: move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Aegis and Phantom (enabling Denial on both), then place trap at (1,3) to threaten the corridor. Wait - if I move to (2,4) I'm adjacent to Phantom at (3,4) and Aegis at (1,4), denying their abilities. Then trap at (1,3) covers the retreat/advance path.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Grid (vector) is adjacent at (2,4) and has DENIAL active, blocking my abilities. I can still use basic attack. I should attack Grid to remove the denial zone, then I lose fortify bonus if I move. Since Grid is adjacent, attack first, then consider moving toward the enemy cluster. Deadeye ally is wounded at (0,3), and Wraith is at (3,3). Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. After attacking Grid, I could move toward (2,3) to get closer to Wraith and position for shield_wall next turn.
  State: Deadeye 3/5, Wraith 3/4, Grid 8/9, Aegis 8/8, Phantom 4/4, Deadeye 3/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) facing N, uncloaked at 3/4 HP. Phantom is at (3,4) facing S — I can reach (3,5) to get behind them and use breach. But orders say save breach for most dangerous enemy. Alternatively, I can shadow_strike Phantom directly since they're adjacent at (3,4). Shadow_strike keeps cloak (but I'm not cloaked). Actually I should use breach on Phantom — they're a specter, dangerous, and I can get behind them. Move to (3,5) first, then breach Phantom from behind. This wastes their turn and denies them action. Aegis is also adjacent but I'm not behind them. Phantom is the priority as another specter with shadow_strike.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward trap at (1,3). I'm adjacent to Grid which blocks abilities (denial zone), so no breach on Wraith even though I'm behind it. I should move to (1,3) as ordered — that's within my move range of 3. No abilities usable due to denial zone adjacency, so just move.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(0,3) ✓ → suppressing_fire(1,3) ✓
  💭 Deadeye (enemy striker) is wounded at (0,3), dist=2, directly north. I'm at (0,1). I can fire precision_shot for 2dmg to finish them off — they're wounded so likely at low HP. I haven't moved yet so no movement penalty. No adjacent enemy Vector blocking. After the kill, I should stay put or reposition slightly. Phantom at (1,3) is healthy and close — suppressing_fire could slow them if needed, but killing Deadeye is priority. Fire precision_shot at Deadeye first, then suppressing_fire at Phantom to slow their advance.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm a Striker at (0,3) with only 1HP — critical condition. Deadeye (enemy striker, wounded) is at (0,1), distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I'm not adjacent to Grid (vector is at distance 3), so precision_shot is NOT blocked. I should fire precision_shot at Deadeye immediately to finish them off. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. No need to move first — Deadeye is already in range at dist=2.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is adjacent at (2,4) and has DENIAL active, blocking my abilities except basic attack. I should attack Grid to eliminate the denial zone threat. I'm fortified (didn't move last turn) so I have 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward aggressively and attack when possible. Grid is right there — attack it. If I move I lose fortify, so attack first then consider position. Wraith is at (3,5) dist=3, threatening. After attacking Grid I could move toward the enemy cluster or hold fortified position.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(2,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed (movement 1) and adjacent to Aegis sentinel. My denial passive blocks Aegis from using some abilities. Phantom is at (1,3) wounded and within range 2. I can't place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector... wait, I'm a Vector, and Aegis is adjacent. Trap is blocked by enemy Vector adjacency, but there's no enemy Vector here - Aegis is a sentinel. So trap should be available. However, Aegis is adjacent (dist=1) so denial applies to Aegis. I should pulse to hit Aegis (dist=1, within 1 tile AoE) for 1 damage to all units within 1 tile. Then place a trap at (1,3) or nearby to threaten Phantom. Actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile including allies - no allies adjacent. Pulse at my position hits Aegis. Then I can move or place trap. Let me pulse first to damage Aegis, then place a trap at (1,4) or (1,3) area to threaten Phantom's position.
  State: Deadeye 1/5, Wraith 3/4, Grid 6/9, Aegis 7/8, Phantom 2/4, Deadeye 1/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (2,3) facing S, and (2,4) is both reachable and directly behind them. I can move to (2,4) to get adjacent behind Aegis. Breach is on cooldown, so I'll use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked if I am cloaked — but I'm not cloaked. I'll move to (2,4) to get behind Aegis and then shadow_strike for 1 damage.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Suppressed to 1 tile movement, adjacent to Grid's denial zone blocking abilities. Only valid move is (1,2). Can't use breach or shadow_strike here due to denial. Move away to (1,2) to escape denial zone, then maybe attack Grid if still adjacent — but Grid is at (1,4) and I'll be at (1,2), dist=2, out of melee. Best play: move to (1,2) to escape denial, then wait.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(0,3) ✓ → move(1,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critically low. Deadeye enemy is critical and 2 tiles away, Phantom is wounded and 2 tiles away. I can precision_shot Deadeye to finish them off since they're critical (any damage kills). I haven't moved yet so no damage penalty. After shooting, I should retreat — move to (0,0) or (1,0) to create distance from Phantom at (1,2). Priority: kill Deadeye first, then reposition away from threats.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (2,4) — attack it. Stay put to keep Fortify active (50% dmg reduction). Shield_wall facing North to protect Phantom at (1,2) from the enemy cluster above.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(1,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded at (1,2), distance 2. Aegis is healthy at (2,3), distance 2. My ally Deadeye is critical at (1,0) - Phantom is threatening them moving south. I should place a trap between Phantom and Deadeye to intercept. Trap at (1,3) would block Phantom's path south toward Deadeye. I'm at (1,4), so I can place a trap at (1,3) without moving first. Then move to (0,3) to maintain denial pressure and control the corridor.
  State: Deadeye 1/5, Wraith 2/4, Grid 6/9, Aegis 6/8, Phantom 2/4 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward trap at (1,3). I'm at (1,2), so move to (1,3) is directly north one tile. Grid is at (0,3) which is adjacent to (1,3) — that's denial range for abilities, but I can still move there. No ability use this turn since I'd be adjacent to Grid after moving.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) behind Aegis at (2,3) facing S — perfect breach position. Phantom is critical at (1,3). I have 2HP and breach is ready. Use breach on Aegis first (already behind them), then move to (1,2) to get behind Phantom for shadow_strike next turn. Actually, better: breach Aegis now from current position (I'm already on the behind tile), then shadow_strike Phantom if I can reach adjacent. Phantom is at (1,3), I need to be adjacent — (1,2) is reachable and behind them. But shadow_strike is adjacent only. After breach, move to (1,2) to be adjacent to Phantom for a shadow_strike? No — breach is the ability for this turn, then I can move. Move to (1,2) first, then shadow_strike Phantom (critical, will likely finish them). Phantom is critical so shadow_strike should finish them. But I'm already behind Aegis — breach Aegis first is also strong. With 2HP I need kills. Phantom is critical — kill it. Move to (1,2) then shadow_strike Phantom.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(2,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP and Aegis is 4 tiles away, out of range. No enemies in range currently. I should reposition to get within range 2 of Aegis while staying safe. Moving to (2,1) gets me closer - dist from (2,1) to (2,3) is 2, which puts Aegis in precision_shot range. Then I can fire.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(1,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (2,3), distance 2 — in range for trap or pulse. Allies: Deadeye at (2,1) critical, Wraith at (1,2) wounded. I should place a trap between Aegis and my allies to control the approach path. Tile (1,3) is a chokepoint between Aegis and Wraith — placing a trap there denies that route. Then I can move to (1,3) to get adjacent to Aegis for denial, blocking their abilities. Wait — if I move to (1,3) first, I'm adjacent to Aegis at (2,3) which blocks my trap ability. Better: place trap at (1,3) first from current position (0,3), then move toward (1,3) or hold. Actually trap range is ≤2 tiles — (1,3) is distance 1, valid. Place trap at (1,3) to catch Aegis if they push through, then move to (0,2) to screen Wraith.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(2,1) ✓
  💭 At 5/8 HP with fortify active, I need to close distance to attack. Deadeye is critical at (2,1) — moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent for an attack. That also keeps me away from Grid's denial range. Move south to (2,2), then attack Deadeye at (2,1).
  State: Wraith 2/4, Grid 6/9, Aegis 5/8 | Dead: Deadeye, Phantom, Deadeye

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,2) facing S. I'm at (1,2) facing S. Aegis is healthy and I'm at 2HP — need to be careful. The behind tile for Aegis is (2,3). I can move to (2,3) to get behind Aegis, then use breach to take control of them. Breach is ready and this is the most dangerous enemy. Moving to (2,3) puts me behind Aegis (adjacent), enabling breach.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 5/8 HP, fortified. Orders say move away from Grid and toward edge, out of combat range. Grid is at (1,4) dist=3, Wraith is at (2,3) dist=1. I need to move away from both. Moving to (4,2) gets me further from Grid (dist increases) and away from Wraith. Then I can wait to maintain fortify next turn.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Trap at (1,3) is already placed blocking that approach. Aegis is at (4,2) dist=5, out of range. Wraith is wounded at (2,3). I should place another trap to control the chokepoint between Aegis and our position. Moving toward (2,4) to get closer while maintaining denial pressure, then placing a trap at (3,4) to cut off Aegis's approach route toward Wraith.
  State: Wraith 2/4, Grid 6/9, Aegis 5/8 | Dead: Deadeye, Phantom, Deadeye

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 2HP, facing N. Aegis is at (4,2) facing E. Breach is unavailable. I need to close in and use shadow_strike. The behind tile for Aegis is (3,2) which is reachable and adjacent to Aegis. I should move to (3,2) to get behind Aegis, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying hidden. Trap at (3,4) is not on my path. Moving to (3,2) puts me behind Aegis and adjacent.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (4,2) dist=4, wounded. Wraith ally is at (3,2) wounded and needs protection. I have traps at (1,3) and (3,4). I should move toward (3,3) to put denial pressure on Aegis approach routes and place a trap at (4,3) to block Aegis from advancing toward Wraith. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to (3,4) trap and closer to Aegis. From (3,3) I can place a trap at (4,3) to block Aegis path to Wraith at (3,2). That's within range 2 of (3,3).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from Grid and toward the edge, out of combat range. I'm at (4,2), Grid is at (3,3) dist=2. Moving to (5,3) increases distance from Grid to ~2.2 and keeps me away from Wraith at (3,2). Then move to (5,2) or stay. Best: move to (5,3) first to maximize distance from both enemies, then wait to maintain fortify.
  State: Wraith 2/4, Grid 6/9, Aegis 4/8 | Dead: Deadeye, Phantom, Deadeye

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (5,3) facing N, wounded. Behind tile is (5,2). I'm at (3,2) with speed 3. I can move to (5,2) which is adjacent and behind Aegis. Breach is unavailable. Shadow_strike from behind for 1 damage. I'm at 2HP so need to be careful. Move to (5,2) then shadow_strike Aegis - this keeps cloak if I have it, but I should just attack. Shadow_strike does 1dmg and keeps cloak. Let me move to (5,2) and shadow_strike.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 At 3/8 HP I need to retreat. Orders say move away from Grid and toward the edge. Moving to (5,5) gets me to the corner, maximizing distance from both enemies. Grid is at (3,3) dist=2, moving to (5,5) increases that distance. Wraith is at (5,2) so moving north on the 5-column keeps distance from Grid but Wraith could follow — however orders are clear to disengage. (5,5) is valid and puts me at corner edge. No ability needed.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (5,5) dist=4, out of range. Wraith is wounded at (5,2). I have traps at (1,3), (3,4), (4,3). Need to control the path between Aegis and my allies. Aegis is moving south likely toward Wraith. Place a trap at (4,4) to intercept Aegis moving toward center, then move toward (4,3) to deny abilities if Aegis closes in.
  State: Wraith 2/4, Grid 6/9, Aegis 3/8 | Dead: Deadeye, Phantom, Deadeye

### Turn 9 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 2HP, Aegis is at (5,5) wounded. Breach is unavailable. I need to move to (5,4) which is directly behind Aegis and adjacent, then use shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. This keeps me safe and deals damage to a wounded enemy.
- **Grid** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,5) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 I'm at (4,3) which already has a trap. Aegis is at (5,5) critical but dist=3, out of range. Wraith is at (5,4) wounded. I need to control the approach. Move to (5,3) to get adjacent to Aegis and apply Denial, blocking their abilities. Then I'm adjacent to Aegis at (5,5) - dist would be 2 from (5,3). Actually (5,5) to (5,3) is dist=2, not adjacent. Let me place a trap at (5,4) to threaten Aegis movement - but Wraith is there. Place trap at (4,5) to cut off escape routes, or move to (5,3) and place trap between Aegis and us. From (5,3), I can trap (5,4) but Wraith is there. Trap (4,4) already exists. Move to (4,5) then trap (5,5) - that's dist=1 from (4,5), in range. That would trap Aegis's current position... they'd have to move off it. Actually trap on (5,5) where Aegis stands would trigger immediately if they're stepping - no, traps trigger on stepping into. Move to (4,5) and place trap at (5,4) to block Aegis escape path north, and threaten Wraith's position - bad idea. Move to (5,3) and place trap at (5,4) to pressure the corridor.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) S ✓
  💭 At 2HP I need to be careful but orders say push aggressively. Wraith is adjacent at (5,4) - I can attack it since it's wounded, possibly finishing it. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) so staying put is safer. Attack Wraith first, then shield_wall facing south to block Grid's approach.
  State: Wraith 1/4, Grid 6/9, Aegis 2/8 | Dead: Deadeye, Phantom, Deadeye

### Turn 10 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (5,5), critical HP, and I'm already behind them. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. At 1HP myself I need to finish this fast. Use shadow_strike now.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is critical at (5,5), distance 2 — within attack range. Wraith is also critical at (5,4). I'm at (5,3). Aegis is adjacent to Wraith, threatening them. I should attack Aegis to finish them off since they're critical. My denial passive also blocks their abilities since I'm at dist 2 — wait, denial only works on adjacent enemies. Aegis is at dist 2 so not adjacent. I can attack Aegis (range 2? No — attack is adjacent only, range=1). Pulse hits all within 1 tile — Aegis is at dist 2, too far. I could move to (5,4)... but Wraith is there. Move to (4,4) — trap is there. Valid moves are [3,3],[4,2],[4,3],[4,4],[5,1],[5,2]. Wait, (4,4) has a trap. I can't reach (5,5) in one move (dist 2, mv 2 — but spd:1 so only 1 move? No mv:2 means I can move up to 2 tiles). Actually my mv is shown as mv2 but spd:1. Let me check valid moves — (5,2) is listed but not (5,4) or (5,5). So I can't reach Aegis directly. Best option: place a trap between positions to deny Aegis movement, or pulse if possible. Pulse range is 1 tile AoE — I need to be adjacent to Aegis. I can't reach adjacency. I'll place a trap at (5,4) to block Aegis from moving south toward my position — but Wraith is at (5,4). Try trap at (4,3) — already has one. Place trap at (5,2) to create denial zone, or stay and use pulse on current position which won't hit anyone. Best: move closer and trap. Move to (4,3) has a trap. Move to (4,2) is safe, then trap at (4,3)? No trap on occupied tiles. Actually let me re-read: I can move to (5,2) and trap somewhere useful. Or stay and trap at (5,4) if valid — Wraith is there so can't trap. Stay and trap at an empty tile near Aegis's path. Aegis at (5,5), likely to move south. Trap at (5,4) blocked by Wraith. No good trap spots from here. Best action: wait/hold denial on Aegis if they approach, or move to threaten. I'll move toward (4,3) — wait it has a trap. Move to (4,2) and trap (5,2) as escape denial.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(5,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) S ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Fortified gives 50% damage reduction if I stay put. Wraith is adjacent at (5,4) and critical - I can attack to finish it. Grid is 2 tiles away and out of range. Best play: attack Wraith to eliminate it, then shield_wall south to block Grid's approach. Staying still preserves fortify bonus.
  State: Grid 6/9, Aegis 1/8 | Dead: Deadeye, Wraith, Phantom, Deadeye
