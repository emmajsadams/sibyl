Actually, move to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (4,2) - that blocks THEIR abilities but also blocks my trap. Move to (3,4) instead, then place trap at (4,2)... Bastion is already there. Place trap at (4,3) to intercept movement. From (3,4) dist to (4,3) is sqrt(1+1)=1.4 ≤ 2, valid. Second ability: place another trap at (5,2) or (4,1) - but (4,1) has Hawk. (5,2) from (3,4) is dist ~2.8 > 2. Place at (4,4) from (3,4): dist=sqrt(1+0)=1 ≤ 2, valid. This covers Bastion's likely escape routes.",
