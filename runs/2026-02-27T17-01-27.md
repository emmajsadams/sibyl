## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Viper** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
### Opponent
- **Hawk** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance north toward enemy lines. Wraith is closest at dist 6. Move to (0,3) to cover ground while staying safe under cloak.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(2,4) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Enemies are far (Viper at dist 4, Marksman at dist 5), no threats adjacent. After cloaking, move south toward Viper to close distance. Target is Viper (enemy damage dealer via vector denial). Moving to (2,2) gets me 2 tiles closer while staying covered.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Round 1, I'm at (4,4). Marksman is in scan range at (4,1) dist=3. Scanning Marksman reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage — high value intel on turn 1. Viper is out of range. After scanning, I can move to (4,5) to stay back behind my front line.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Both enemies are 5-6 tiles away. I need to close distance while staying at max range. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer without being adjacent to enemies. From there I'm still out of range but better positioned for next turn.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is at dist=3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles means I need dist≤2, but recon says Hawk is inRange=true at dist=3... checking: range:≤2 tiles but dist=3 shows inRange:true, so the recon confirms it's valid). No enemies are wounded yet, so I'll target the closest enemy Hawk. I'm at (4,1), not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg. Stay at current position to maximize range safety.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. Hawk is at (3,3) moving south, likely to pass through (3,2) or (3,1). I should advance and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (3,1) puts me closer to the action and lets me trap (3,2) which Hawk may step through. That tile is 1 away so within trap range of ≤2.
  State: Veil 4/4, Viper 9/9, Marksman 4/5, Hawk 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Watcher 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. No enemies reachable this turn. I need to advance toward Hawk at (3,3) facing S — behind tile is (3,4). Move max distance toward (3,4) to get in position next turn. Best move is (2,3) or (2,4) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is in scan range at dist=3 — scanning reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage. They're a specter who just cloaked, so getting their prompt now is valuable before they vanish. After scanning, I can move to (3,4) to stay mobile while keeping distance from Viper's trap at (3,2). Marksman is already scanned. Viper is out of scan range.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → breach(2,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak has only 1 turn remaining — I need to use it wisely this turn. Orders say prioritize enemy damage dealer. Marksman is the priority striker but unreachable behind. Viper is a vector (denial threat) — I should avoid getting adjacent. Veil is an enemy specter at (2,4) facing E, with behind tile at (1,4) reachable. I can move to (1,4) to get behind Veil and breach them — this would neutralize the enemy specter and let me control them next turn. Move to (1,4) then breach Veil. Veil facing E means I'm behind from the west at (1,4). Breach range is ≤2 tiles and must be behind — (1,4) is adjacent and behind. This is a clean play.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I should target per orders. Veil (specter) and Viper (vector) are both at dist=2 and in range. Viper is a vector which blocks my precision_shot if adjacent — but Viper is at dist=2, not adjacent, so I can shoot. However, orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded, but there's no medic visible. I'll target Veil (specter) with precision_shot since it's at dist=2 and I haven't moved (full 2 damage). I'll stay at current position to maintain range and avoid moving adjacent to Viper.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Hawk is the only enemy in range at dist 3, but precision_shot has range ≤2 tiles. Need to close to range 2 without going adjacent. Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist 2 from Hawk at (3,3) — that's adjacent diagonally which counts as dist 2 (Chebyshev). Wait, (4,3) to (3,3) is dist 1 — that's adjacent, blocked. Moving to (5,3) would be dist 2 from Hawk. But (5,3) isn't in valid moves. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist 1 from Hawk... no wait (4,2) to (3,3) is sqrt(2) ≈ diagonal. Dist = max(|4-3|,|2-3|) = 1. Also adjacent. I must stay at range ≥2 tiles. Move to (5,2): dist to Hawk (3,3) = max(|5-3|,|2-3|) = max(2,1) = 2. That's in range and not adjacent! Fire precision_shot from (5,2). No movement penalty since I moved but precision_shot says 1dmg if moved... orders say stay at max range. From (5,2) precision_shot deals 1dmg since I moved. Alternatively stay at (4,1) and Hawk is at dist 3, out of range for precision_shot. I need to move to get in range. Best option: move to (5,2) for dist 2 to Hawk, fire precision_shot for 1dmg (moved penalty). Or move to (4,2) but that's adjacent. (5,1) to Hawk (3,3): max(2,2)=2, in range, not adjacent. Move to (5,1) then shoot — same position as now basically, dist 2 to Hawk. Let me pick (5,2): max(|5-3|,|2-3|)=2, valid.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 There's already a trap at (3,2) between me and Hawk at (3,3). Hawk is directly north and likely to advance south or stay. I should place another trap to create a kill zone. Move north to (3,2) is blocked by my own trap. I can move to (4,2) and place a trap at (4,3) to catch Hawk if it shifts east, or stay and trap (2,2) to cover western approach. Watcher at (3,4) is likely to move south toward me — placing a trap at (3,2) is already covered. I'll move to (4,1) to reposition slightly east and place a trap at (4,2) to catch Hawk moving diagonally or Watcher advancing. Actually, best play: stay at (3,1), place trap at (4,2) to cover Hawk's likely path if it moves SE. This maintains pressure with the existing trap at (3,2) while adding coverage.
  State: Veil 1/4, Viper 9/9, Marksman 4/5, Hawk 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Watcher 6/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Orders say move south toward back line. Wraith is adjacent at (1,4) facing N, so (1,3) is behind them. Watcher is adjacent at (3,4) facing S, so (3,5) is behind them. I should breach Watcher from behind — move to (3,5) first, then breach Watcher. This gets me south toward back line AND uses breach on a high-value oracle target. Watcher facing S means (3,5) is behind them and reachable.
- **Watcher** (oracle): attack(3,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is critical and adjacent at (3,5) — scan already done so no need to scan again. Orders say move north away from allies. I can scan Veil for damage (1dmg could finish it if critical means low HP), but scan requires target within 4 tiles and not blocked by adjacent Vector — Viper is at (2,1) not adjacent to me so scan is fine. Actually attack is only adjacent range. Veil is adjacent at (3,5) so I can attack for 1dmg. But orders say move away toward (3,5) or (2,5). If I move to (3,5) I'd occupy Veil's current position — but Veil's foresight shows it moving to (2,4) this turn. So (3,5) should be free after Veil moves. I'll attack Veil first (it's adjacent, critical — finish it), then move north to (2,5) to separate from allies.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Marksman at (5,2) is the priority target (damage dealer). I can't reach behind positions this turn. Move aggressively toward Marksman — heading to (3,4) then (4,4) gets me closer. Best move is toward (3,4) to close distance on Marksman while staying away from Viper's denial range. Breach is on cooldown. I'll advance to (3,4) to position for next turn.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is at dist 3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles? wait, range is ≤2 tiles). Recon says Hawk is inRange=true from pos (5,2) at dist=3. So precision_shot must reach dist 3. I'm at (5,2), Hawk at (3,3). I haven't moved so no penalty. No enemies adjacent blocking. Fire precision_shot on Hawk for 2dmg. Avoid traps at (3,2) and (4,2). No need to move — I'm at max effective range already.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,2) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are healthy at dist=3. No medic to prioritize, so target Marksman (striker) as it's a ranged threat. I haven't moved yet, so precision_shot will deal full 2dmg. Stay at current position to maintain range and avoid Viper adjacency.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Enemies are approaching from the north. Hawk is at (3,3) moving south, likely to pass through (3,2) or (3,1). There's already a trap at (3,2). I should place a trap at (2,2) to cover my position and potential approach routes. Moving to (2,2) first gives me better positioning and then I can place a trap on a likely enemy path like (3,1) which Hawk might step through advancing south.
  State: Viper 9/9, Marksman 4/5, Hawk 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Watcher 6/6 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 4 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → scan(2,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move north toward (3,5) or (2,5). I'm already at (2,5), so I should move to (3,5) to follow orders. Viper is at (2,2), dist=3 — safe to scan before or after moving. Scanning Viper will reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. I'm not adjacent to Viper so scan is not blocked. Move to (3,5) first, then scan Viper from there — dist from (3,5) to (2,2) is sqrt(1+9)=~3.16, still within 4 tiles. Good.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Marksman at (5,2) is the priority target (damage dealer). I can't reach behind them this turn. Move toward Marksman to close distance — (4,3) gets me closer while staying away from Viper's denial range. Then wait to preserve position.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both Hawk and Wraith are healthy. No medic on enemy team. Wraith is closest at dist=2. I'm at (5,2), not adjacent to any Vector, so precision_shot is available. Wraith is at (4,3) dist=2 - within range. I haven't moved so full 2dmg. No traps in my current position. I'll stay put and use precision_shot on Wraith (closest, easier to finish later), then wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are healthy. No medic to prioritize. Viper is at dist=2 which is within precision_shot range, but I must not move adjacent. Marksman is at dist=3, out of precision_shot range (max 2). I'll fire precision_shot at Viper (dist=2, not adjacent, LoS clear). I haven't moved so full 2dmg. Stay at current position to avoid closing distance.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(2,3) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (3,3) dist=2, healthy. Traps already at (3,2), (4,2), (3,1) blocking southern approach. Hawk is moving south toward me. I should move to avoid being adjacent (which would block my trap ability) and place a trap on a likely path. Moving to (1,2) keeps distance while I place a trap at (2,3) or (2,1) to cover flanking routes. Actually, Hawk at (3,3) moving south might step through (3,2) trap already. I can place trap at (2,3) to cover west movement, then stay mobile. Let me place trap at (2,3) first from current position (2,2) - that's within range 2. Then move to (1,2) to maintain distance from Hawk.
  State: Viper 6/9, Marksman 4/5, Hawk 5/5, Wraith 2/4, Watcher 6/6 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 5 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move north away from allies toward (3,5) or (2,5). I'm already at (3,5), so I should move to (2,5) to comply. Both enemies are out of scan range (dist 5, need ≤4). No useful ability to use this turn.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,1) ✓ → breach(5,2) ✓
  💭 Marksman is the priority target (enemy damage dealer, dist=2). I can reach (5,1) which is directly behind Marksman (facing N). From there I can breach or shadow_strike. Breach would let me control Marksman next turn. Move to (5,1) then breach Marksman from behind.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,2) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are healthy at distance 3. No medic to prioritize. Marksman is the greater threat as a ranged DPS. I'm at full HP (5/5) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'll stay at current position to avoid getting adjacent to Viper, and fire precision_shot at Marksman.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from Hawk (3,3) and Wraith (5,1), toward the edge. Wraith is adjacent at (5,1) to my south. Valid moves: (5,4) moves me north along the east edge, away from both threats. From (5,4) I can't reach any enemy. I'll move to (5,4) to maximize distance from Wraith and Hawk.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(2,1) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Hawk is at (3,3) heading south, likely moving toward center. Good trap placement would be (2,2) or (2,1) to intercept movement. I can move to (2,2) to get closer and place a trap on a likely Hawk approach path like (2,1) or stay and trap from here. Valid tiles include (2,2) and (2,3). Move to (2,2) then trap at (2,1) to create a chokepoint between existing traps.
  State: Viper 6/9, Marksman 4/5, Hawk 5/5, Wraith 2/4, Watcher 6/6 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 6 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → ? ✗ Unknown action
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — prompts known. Viper is 3 tiles away at (2,2), so I must not move adjacent. Marksman is at (5,4), out of scan range (dist 4, need ≤4... wait, dist is exactly 4, and scan range is ≤4, so it IS in range if I can get closer). Actually Marksman is already scanned too. Wraith is wounded at (5,1) — I should recalibrate them to help. Wraith is not adjacent to me (5,1 vs 2,5 = dist 5), so recalibrate won't reach. Hawk is at (3,3), also not adjacent. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. Viper placed a trap at (2,1) last turn — avoid that tile. I should reposition to stay safe and potentially get adjacent to an ally for recalibrate next turn. Move toward Hawk at (3,3) — moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk. Then wait since no ability targets are useful this turn (both enemies scanned, no adjacent allies to recalibrate).
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Marksman at (5,4) is the priority target — damage dealer. I can reach (5,3) which is directly behind Marksman (facing N, behind tile is (5,3)). Move to (5,3) then shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Orders are to move away from Hawk and Wraith, toward the edge. I'm at (5,4). Wraith is adjacent at (5,3) to my south. Hawk is at (3,3). Moving to (5,5) gets me to the north edge and away from both threats. From (5,5) I can still shoot Watcher at (3,4) dist=2 with precision_shot for 2dmg.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(5,5) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded but out of range at dist=4. Viper is at dist=2 and in range, but is healthy. Orders say to use precision_shot on most wounded enemy. Marksman is wounded but I need to close distance. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Marksman (dist from 4,4 to 5,5 = 2) while staying away from Viper (dist from 4,4 to 2,2 = ~2.8, not adjacent). From (4,4) I can then fire precision_shot at Marksman. But wait — if I move first, precision_shot does only 1dmg. Still worth it to hit wounded Marksman. Let me verify: (4,4) to (5,5) = dist sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41, which is within range 2. And (4,4) to (2,2) = dist sqrt(8) ≈ 2.83, not adjacent. This is the right play — move to (4,4), then precision_shot Marksman.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range. I have dense trap coverage around (3,2), (4,2), (3,1), (2,3), (2,1). Enemies are approaching from the northeast — Watcher at (3,4), Hawk at (4,4), Wraith at (5,3). The path from (3,4) southward toward me would go through (3,3) or (3,2). I should move northeast to close distance and place a trap on (3,3) to intercept Watcher's likely southward advance. Moving to (3,3) is valid and puts me closer while I place a trap there.
  State: Viper 6/9, Marksman 2/5, Hawk 5/5, Wraith 2/4, Watcher 6/6 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and I'm already behind them. Move to (5,4) — directly behind Marksman — then shadow_strike for 1 damage. This should finish or nearly finish them. Viper is 2 tiles away at (3,3), so moving to (5,4) keeps me safely away from denial range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper at (3,3) which blocks my scan ability. Marksman is critical at (5,5) — already scanned. I need to move away from Viper's denial zone to enable scan. Moving to (2,4) gets me out of adjacency. From there I can scan Marksman (but already scanned) or just reposition. Actually both enemies are already scanned. Best move: escape Viper's denial zone by moving to (2,4), then attack Viper (who would be at dist 2 — too far for attack range 1). Wait, attack range is adjacent only. If I move to (2,4), Viper is at (3,3) = distance 2, can't attack. If I move to (2,3) Viper is adjacent and I can attack for 1dmg, but scan is still blocked. Viper is healthy so 1dmg doesn't help much. Marksman is critical — if I move to (3,5) then scan Marksman at (5,5) dist=2, but already scanned. Recalibrate on Hawk at (4,4) to help finish Marksman. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Hawk, then recalibrate Hawk to focus on Marksman. That's useful since Marksman is critical and Hawk has precision_shot.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is critical and within range 2 at (5,5). I'm at (4,4), not adjacent to Viper, so precision_shot is available. Fire precision_shot at Marksman to finish them off. No need to move.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with many traps already placed. Hawk is at (4,4) distance 2, in range. I should place a trap on a tile Hawk might move through. (4,3) already has a trap. Hawk is moving north, so (4,5) or (5,4) area. I can move to (4,3) - wait that has a trap. Let me place a trap at (3,4) to cut off movement, then consider pulse. Actually (3,4) is a valid move tile suggesting it's empty. I'll place trap at (3,4) to block the path, then use pulse - but Hawk is at distance 2 so pulse won't reach. Better to place trap at (4,3) - already placed. Place trap at a new tile near enemy approach paths. (5,3) is reachable and would be in Hawk's path. I'll move to (4,2) to place trap there - wait (4,2) already has trap. Move to (3,5) to cut off Watcher approach, then place trap there.
  State: Viper 6/9, Hawk 5/5, Wraith 2/4, Watcher 6/6 | Dead: Veil, Marksman

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP, cloaked. Breach is unavailable. Viper is at (3,4) dist=2, facing N. The behind tile is (3,3) which is reachable. I can't breach, but I can shadow_strike from adjacent. Moving to (3,3) puts me behind Viper and adjacent — then I can shadow_strike for 1 dmg while staying cloaked. That's the best play: move to (3,3), then shadow_strike Viper.
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded and 2 tiles away — already scanned so no need to scan again. I should recalibrate Hawk at (4,4) who is adjacent to me, giving tactical advice about Viper's trap strategy. Then stay put or reposition slightly. Hawk needs to know Viper tried to trap (4,4) and failed — warn them to avoid that tile or anticipate traps on likely movement paths. I'll recalibrate Hawk first, then wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper at (3,4) which means precision_shot is BLOCKED by denial zone. I can only use basic attack or move. Viper is wounded so I should attack first to potentially finish them, then move to (5,5) to get distance and range advantage.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(3,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Wraith is wounded and adjacent at (3,3) - prime pulse target. Watcher at (4,5) is dist=2, not adjacent. Only Wraith is within 1 tile for pulse. Pulse hits Wraith for 1dmg (wounded, could finish or cripple). Then I need to reposition. Moving to (2,4) keeps distance from Wraith while staying useful. Actually, pulse first to hit Wraith, then move away to safety. Traps are already dense around (3,2),(4,2),(3,1),(2,3) - good coverage. Pulse Wraith now, then move north to (3,5) to threaten Watcher area.
