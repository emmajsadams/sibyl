## Squads
### Player
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Remedy** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(4,5) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies are far away (dist 6-8). TIP says cloak now. I'll cloak first, then advance toward Longshot (priority target, enemy damage dealer) by moving to (4,2) to close distance while invisible.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are 5+ tiles away. I should advance toward my frontliners to be in position to support. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to Warden at (2,4) so I can overclock or patch next turn. No abilities to use this turn.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then advance toward Remedy (the medic at 2,3) who is 4 tiles away. Moving to (1,3) gets me 3 tiles closer while staying cloaked and out of sight.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy (medic) is highest priority target at dist=2, within precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet so I get full 2dmg. Stay at current position and fire precision_shot at Remedy first. No need to move — already in range and not adjacent to any Vector.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are at dist 4-5, out of range. I need to advance and set up trap coverage. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to the midfield. From there I can place a trap at (2,3) or (3,3) to intercept enemies moving south. Remedy is at (2,3) — if I move to (3,2) I can place a trap at (2,3) right on her position or just ahead of the expected enemy advance route. Actually trap goes on empty tiles, so I'll trap (3,3) as a chokepoint between enemies and my allies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Enemies are 3 tiles south. Move toward them to (2,2) to close distance. Then use shield_wall facing S to protect allies from the southern enemies.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Lattice 9/9, Warden 8/8, Ghost 4/4, Remedy 10/12

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. Remedy is adjacent at (2,3) but I'm not behind them. I can move to (2,4) to get behind Remedy, then use breach to take control of them — high value since they're the enemy medic. Warden is also behind me at (2,2) facing S, meaning (2,3) is behind Warden too, but Remedy is more valuable. Move to (2,4) first to get behind Remedy, then breach.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward trap at (3,3) and away from allies. (3,3) is in my valid moves list. Wraith is adjacent at (2,4) — moving to (3,3) increases distance from Wraith and gets me to the target tile. No healing needed (all allies full HP). Just move, no ability needed.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks abilities. I need to move away from Lattice first to enable abilities. My orders say to assassinate the enemy damage dealer — Longshot is the striker (primary damage threat). I can't reach Longshot's back this turn, but I can move to (3,1) which is behind Lattice, or reposition toward Longshot. The recon shows no reachable tiles behind Longshot this turn. Best move: step to (3,1) to get behind Lattice and out of denial zone, then shadow_strike Lattice — this preserves cloak. That removes the Vector denial zone for my allies and sets up future breaches on Longshot.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(1,0) ✓ → suppressing_fire(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to both Warden (sentinel) and Ghost (specter), which blocks precision_shot. Priority is to create distance so I can use precision_shot on Remedy (medic). Moving to (1,0) gets me away from both adjacent enemies. From (1,0) Remedy is still out of range at dist ~3, but I can use suppressing_fire on Ghost at (3,1) to slow them. Actually, let me move to (2,0) to maintain some distance from Ghost and Warden. From (2,0), Ghost is at dist 1 still adjacent. Better to move to (1,0) - Ghost at dist ~2.2, Warden at dist ~2.2, not adjacent. Then I can use suppressing_fire targeting Ghost to slow their approach.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Lattice is adjacent at (3,2) and I'm fortified. I should attack Lattice since it's in range. Wraith is to the north at dist 2, Longshot to the south at dist 3. Most enemies are spread but Wraith is closest non-adjacent. I'll attack Lattice first, then use shield_wall facing North to block Wraith.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(3,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm surrounded by 3 enemies at distance 1: Warden(2,2), Ghost(3,1), Remedy(3,3). My Denial passive is already blocking their abilities since they're adjacent. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - that's all 3 enemies at once for 1 damage each. This is the ideal pulse opportunity. After pulsing, I should move away to avoid retaliation or place a trap on an escape route. Move to (4,2) to create distance from the cluster, then pulse would have been better first. Actually: pulse first from (3,2) hitting all 3 adjacent enemies, then move to (4,2) to reposition away from the cluster.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Wraith 4/4, Lattice 7/9, Warden 7/8, Ghost 2/4, Remedy 8/12

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Remedy (medic) is high priority — I'm behind them from (2,3) and adjacent. Move to (2,3) which is behind both Warden and Remedy, then shadow_strike Remedy for 1dmg while staying cloaked.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward trap at (3,3) and away from allies. I'm already at (3,3), so I need to interpret this as moving away from allies and toward that general area. Wraith is adjacent at (2,3) — dangerous. Lattice vector at (4,2) blocks abilities if I'm adjacent. I should move away from Wraith and allies. Moving to (4,3) keeps me near the trap coordinate and away from allies, but puts me adjacent to Lattice at (4,2) — bad, abilities blocked. Moving to (3,4) moves away from Wraith and Lattice. Moving to (4,4) gets further from both enemies and allies. Let me go to (4,4) — away from Wraith, away from Lattice denial range, away from allies.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed (movement 1), at 2/4 HP. Orders say assassinate enemy damage dealer (Longshot) and use breach on sentinels. No sentinel in range. Longshot is at (1,0), dist 3 — unreachable this turn. Lattice vector at (4,2) is 2 tiles away — I must NOT move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. Valid moves are [2,1],[3,0],[3,2],[4,1]. Moving to (3,2) puts me behind Lattice and adjacent — but that blocks abilities AND Lattice denies cloak/breach. Moving to (2,1) gets me 1 tile closer to Longshot at (1,0), dist would be 2. From (2,1) I could reach Longshot next turn. I should move toward Longshot and wait — no ability in range this turn.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded and adjacent at dist=2 — priority target. I'm at (1,0) facing S. Ghost is at (2,1), dist=2. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Firing precision_shot on Ghost should finish or heavily damage them. I'll stay put to keep range and avoid triggering the adjacent-to-Vector restriction (Lattice is at 4,2, not adjacent). After shooting, I can wait or reposition — staying at (1,0) maintains distance from Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (2,3). Orders say attack if enemy is adjacent. After attacking, I'm stationary so Fortify stays active. Most enemies are to the North/East but Wraith is directly North at dist=1. Shield wall facing North covers Wraith's direction and protects against further threats.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → pulse(4,3) ✓
  💭 Remedy is wounded at (4,4), distance 2 — pulse won't reach but I can move to (4,3) to get adjacent and pulse her. That also puts me closer to deny her heal abilities. Warden is at (2,2), not adjacent so denial doesn't apply yet. Moving to (4,3) gets me adjacent to Remedy at (4,4), then pulse hits her for 1 damage. Better to finish off wounded Remedy than trap placement this turn.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Wraith 3/4, Lattice 7/9, Warden 7/8, Remedy 6/12 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): breach(2,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) directly behind Warden at (2,2) who faces S. Breach is ready and I'm already on a behind tile. Use breach on Warden to take control — high value since it neutralizes a sentinel for a turn. Then move toward Remedy at (4,4) to pressure the wounded medic next turn.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (4,3), which blocks my abilities. Orders say move away from allies and toward the trap at (3,3). However, moving to (3,3) would put me on Wraith's position — that's occupied. I need to move away from Lattice to escape denial zone, while heading toward (3,3) area. I'll move to (3,4) to get closer to the trap zone and escape Lattice's denial. Actually (3,4) is valid and gets me adjacent to (3,3). Then wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✗ Out of range → move(3,0) ✓
  💭 Remedy (medic) is the priority target but out of range at dist 6. Warden (sentinel) is in range at dist 3. Orders say medics first, but Remedy is too far. I can move toward Remedy to close distance while keeping Warden in range. Moving to (3,0) gets me closer to Remedy (dist ~4) and keeps Warden at dist ~2. From (3,0), Warden at (2,2) is dist 3 still in range — I can precision_shot Warden this turn since I haven't moved yet (full 2 dmg). Wait — precision_shot does 1dmg if moved. So I should ability first, then move. Fire precision_shot on Warden first (2dmg, stationary), then move toward Remedy.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I have Fortify active (50% damage reduction) since I didn't move last turn. Orders say to move away from allies and toward the flank, but I should not blindly expose myself. Wraith is at (3,3) dist=2, Longshot at (3,0) dist=3. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer to center and keeps pressure. However, orders say move away from allies - Remedy is at (3,4). Moving toward (1,2) or (2,1) moves me away from Remedy. I'll move to (3,2) to apply flank pressure while staying aggressive, though this loses Fortify. Actually orders say expose myself on flank - moving toward (2,0) or (3,1) gets me toward Longshot's side. I'll move to (3,1) to approach Longshot on the flank.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 Remedy is wounded and adjacent (dist=2) — prime target. I can move to (4,4) to get adjacent and use attack, or stay and pulse. Moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to Remedy at (3,4) but Wraith is already there. Best play: move to (4,4) to get within 1 tile of Remedy for pulse (hits Remedy, possibly Wraith too — check positions: Wraith@(3,3), Remedy@(3,4), me@(4,4) — Remedy is 1 tile away, Wraith is diagonal ~1.4 away so outside pulse radius). Actually pulse range is 1 tile AoE, so from (4,4) Remedy@(3,4) is dist=1, Warden@(3,1) is dist=3 out. Pulse hits Remedy for 1dmg. Or I could use trap to block Warden's approach path. Remedy is wounded and closer threat — pulse from (4,4) hits Remedy. Then I also deny abilities to Remedy if adjacent. Let me move to (4,4) and pulse Remedy's tile.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Wraith 3/4, Lattice 7/9, Warden 7/8, Remedy 5/12 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 5 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, so patch/overclock are blocked. I need to move away from Lattice to enable healing. Warden at (3,1) is wounded (7/8 HP) and needs patch. I should move to (3,2) to get closer to Warden and out of Lattice's denial, then I can attack Wraith who is right next to me — actually after moving I lose adjacency to Wraith. Let me move to (2,3) to escape denial zone and get closer to Warden, then attack Wraith if still in range. Actually from (3,2) I'm dist=1 from Warden and can patch next turn. Moving to (3,2) gets me out of Lattice's denial and closer to Warden. From (3,2) Wraith at (3,3) is still adjacent so I could attack. Best plan: move to (3,2) to escape denial zone, then attack Wraith who should still be adjacent.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy is adjacent at (3,2) and I'm already behind them at (3,3). They're wounded. Breach is unavailable. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. Use shadow_strike on Remedy first, then wait or reposition.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,0) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,1) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Priority is Remedy (medic, wounded) at range 2. I need to move away from Warden first to enable precision_shot, then shoot Remedy. Moving to (4,0) puts me at distance 2 from Remedy and clears the adjacent Warden block.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Remedy is at (3,2) and Warden at (3,1) - they're clustered together. I should move closer and place a trap between them and my allies. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer while positioning a trap at (3,3) would block their advance path. Actually Wraith is at (3,3) wounded - I should avoid trapping there. Move to (4,3) to close distance, then trap at (3,2) or (3,3) to threaten enemies. Wait - Wraith is at (3,3) so I can't trap there. Moving to (3,4) then trapping at (3,2) would place a mine right on Remedy's current position or their likely move path. Let me move to (3,4) and trap (3,2) - that's within 2 tiles of (3,4) and sits right where Remedy is standing.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies toward our flank, exposing myself. Remedy is at (3,2) so I should move away. Longshot is at (4,0) which is my flank direction. Moving to (4,1) gets me closer to Longshot and away from allies. I can't attack Longshot yet (need adjacent), so I'll move toward them. Moving to (4,1) then (5,1) to push flank hard, or just (4,1) and wait to preserve fortify next turn.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Wraith 2/4, Lattice 7/9, Warden 7/8, Remedy 4/12 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy is adjacent at (3,2) and I'm already behind them (Remedy faces S, I'm at (3,3) which is behind). I'm at 2HP so I need to finish this fast. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg while keeping cloak — Remedy is wounded so shadow_strike should finish or severely weaken them. Use shadow_strike on Remedy now, then wait or reposition.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(4,2) ✓ → patch(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/12 HP which is critical. Wraith is adjacent at (3,3) threatening me. Warden needs heal at (4,1) but is dist=2, not adjacent. I need to move away from Wraith and toward Warden to heal them. Move to (4,2) gets me closer to Warden (dist=1) and away from Wraith. From (4,2) Warden at (4,1) is adjacent and I can patch them. Lattice is at (3,4) dist=2 from current pos — moving to (4,2) keeps me dist=2+ from Lattice so abilities won't be blocked.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Remedy is critical and high-value (medic). I'm at (4,0), Warden is adjacent at (4,1) which blocks precision_shot (Vector restriction doesn't apply here — Warden is sentinel, not vector). Wait — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not sentinel. Warden is sentinel, so precision_shot is still valid. But Remedy is at dist=2, so I can hit her with precision_shot for 2dmg (if I don't move). Killing or finishing a critical medic is top priority. I'll stay put and use precision_shot on Remedy at (4,2). No need to move — shooting first preserves full damage.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Remedy is critical at (4,2) and Warden is at (4,1). I'm at (3,4). I should advance toward the enemies and place a trap on a likely path. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Remedy (at dist 1) and close to Warden. From (4,3) I can place a trap at (4,2) or between them. Actually, if I move to (4,3), Remedy at (4,2) is adjacent — my Denial passive would block their abilities. I can then place a trap at (3,2) or (4,1) to block escape. Let me move to (4,3) first, then trap at (4,2) to catch Remedy or Warden if they step there. Wait — if Remedy is already at (4,2) I can't place a trap on an occupied tile. Trap requires empty tile. So trap at (3,2) or (5,2) as a chokepoint. Move to (4,3) brings me adjacent to Remedy, activating Denial. Then trap at (3,2) to cut off retreat.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,1) ✓ → attack(5,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies toward our flank. Remedy is at (4,2) which is adjacent north. I should move away from Remedy while maintaining my fortified position if possible. Moving to (3,1) keeps me away from Lattice's denial range at (4,3) and moves toward flank. But orders say expose myself — moving to (5,1) pushes toward Longshot at (5,0) and away from Remedy. I'll move to (5,1) to follow orders, but that puts me adjacent to Longshot. I can't attack Longshot from current position but after moving to (5,1) I'd be adjacent. However moving loses Fortify. I'll move to (5,1) to engage Longshot's flank as ordered.
  State: Longshot 4/5, Wraith 2/4, Lattice 7/9, Warden 8/8, Remedy 1/12 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Remedy is at (4,2) critical HP and I'm behind them. (3,2) is a trap tile but I need to get adjacent to shadow_strike. I can move to (4,1) to get adjacent to Remedy without stepping on the trap, then shadow_strike. Wait — (4,1) is adjacent to Remedy at (4,2), distance 1. Let me check: from (4,1) to (4,2) is adjacent. Shadow_strike works on adjacent targets. Move to (4,1) first, then shadow_strike Remedy to finish them off.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,1) ✓ → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (5,1) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel not a vector, so check: the warning says precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Warden is a sentinel, so precision_shot should still work. But wait — Warden is at dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires ≤2 tiles range. Adjacent is range 1, so it's in range. However, precision_shot does 1dmg if I moved. Orders say maintain distance, so I should move away first then shoot — but valid moves are (3,0), (4,0), (5,2). Moving to (4,0) puts me at dist 2 from Warden (5,1), which maintains distance and allows precision_shot at full 2dmg (since range ≤2 tiles and I moved so 1dmg). Actually let me reconsider: move first to (4,0), then precision_shot Warden — but I moved so only 1dmg. OR: precision_shot first (2dmg, no move penalty), then move away. Better to shoot first at 2dmg then move to safety.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,1) W ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,1) — attack it while it's wounded. Then use shield_wall facing West (toward Longshot and Wraith) to protect against incoming damage. Staying in place preserves Fortify.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(5,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical at (4,1), Warden is at (5,1) dist 3. Need to protect allies. There's already a trap at (3,2). I should move closer to Warden to apply denial pressure and place a trap on the path between Warden and my allies. Moving to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Warden at (5,1) - that applies denial and blocks abilities. Then I can't trap from adjacent to enemy, so I should move to (5,2) for denial, or place trap first then move. Place trap at (5,2) to block Warden's approach, then move to (4,2) to be closer. Actually: trap at (5,2) is within range 2, then move toward (4,2). This creates a chokepoint if Warden advances.
  State: Longshot 4/5, Wraith 1/4, Lattice 7/9, Warden 7/8 | Dead: Ghost, Remedy

### Turn 8 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, adjacent to Warden at (5,1). I'm already behind Warden (behind check confirms). Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best option: use shadow_strike on Warden for 1 damage — it's adjacent and keeps any cloak state. With only 1HP I need to deal damage before I go down. Shadow_strike is the right call here since I'm adjacent.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is at (5,1), distance 2 — in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet, so I get full 2dmg. No adjacent enemies blocking. Fire on Warden first, then consider repositioning. Current position (4,0) is fine — maintain distance.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → pulse(5,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (5,1) - my Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. I'm standing on a trap at (5,2) which is bad. I should move off this trap tile first. Moving to (5,3) keeps pressure while staying close to deny Warden's abilities. Then pulse to hit Warden for 1 damage since they're within 1 tile range.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,1) W ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,1) and critical — attack to finish them. Then shield_wall facing West to block Longshot at (4,0).
  State: Longshot 4/5, Lattice 7/9, Warden 5/8 | Dead: Wraith, Ghost, Remedy

### Turn 9 — player
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,1) ✓ → move(3,0) ✓
  💭 Warden is at dist=2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Fire first, then move away to maintain distance.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (5,1), dist=2, in range. Trap at (5,2) already blocks direct path south. I can place another trap to further deny movement, or pulse to chip damage. Pulse hits everything within 1 tile — Warden is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach. I can attack (adjacent only) — Warden is dist=2 so no. Best play: move to (5,2) is a trap tile, avoid that. Move to (4,2) to get adjacent to Warden's path, then trap at (5,1) directly on Warden? No, traps go on empty tiles. (5,2) has a trap already. Move to (4,3) keeps position, then trap (5,2) — already trapped. Let me trap (4,2) to create a second chokepoint blocking western escape. Actually best: stay put, place trap at (4,2) to block Warden's western movement path while (5,2) already blocks north approach.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,1) W ✓
  💭 Both enemies are 3 tiles away. I should advance toward Longshot at (3,0) who is the nearest striker threat. Moving to (4,1) gets me closer while keeping fortify if I only move once. I'll move to (4,1) and use shield_wall facing West where both enemies are concentrated.
  State: Longshot 4/5, Lattice 7/9, Warden 4/8 | Dead: Wraith, Ghost, Remedy

### Turn 10 — player
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and in range at distance 2. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire first, then stay put or reposition. No need to move — current position is safe at dist 2, not adjacent so no Vector suppression concern.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → attack(3,0) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are 2 tiles away. Longshot is at (3,0), Lattice at (4,3). I need to advance toward nearest enemy. Moving to (3,1) brings me adjacent to Longshot at (3,0), enabling an attack. Lattice is to the north so shield_wall facing N could help, but attacking Longshot is priority. Move to (3,1) then attack Longshot.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is at (3,1) dist 3, wounded. I have traps at (3,2), (5,2), (4,2) already placed. Warden moving north would hit (3,2) trap. I should move closer to apply denial and potentially block Warden's abilities, while placing another trap to funnel. Move to (3,3) to be adjacent threat zone, then trap (2,2) to cut off escape routes near Longshot at (3,0).
  State: Longshot 3/5, Lattice 7/9, Warden 3/8 | Dead: Wraith, Ghost, Remedy

### Turn 11 — player
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,1) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel, not a Vector. However, I am adjacent to Warden (dist=1), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles but NOT adjacent to enemy Vector. Warden is a sentinel so no Vector adjacency block. But wait — Warden is adjacent (dist=1), and attack is for adjacent only. I can use precision_shot at range ≤2 which includes dist=1. Actually re-reading: precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically. Warden is sentinel, so precision_shot is fine. But I moved last turn (showing →W), so precision_shot deals 1dmg instead of 2. Better to move away first to get distance, then shoot. Move to (2,0) to stay at dist>1 from Warden, then use precision_shot from stationary position — but I'd be moving this turn so it would still be 1dmg. Alternative: attack for 1dmg adjacent, or move away and use suppressing_fire. Actually: move to (4,1) to increase distance from Warden to 2, then precision_shot for 1dmg (moved penalty). Or stay and attack for 1dmg. Warden is wounded — if low HP, any 1dmg might finish. Let me move to (4,1) to avoid being adjacent and use precision_shot (1dmg due to movement).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (4,1) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Attack Longshot, then stay put to keep fortify active.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical at (3,1) and within range 2. I can attack for 1dmg to finish them off. The row (3,2) already has a trap. I'll move closer to apply denial pressure and then attack Warden.
  State: Longshot 2/5, Lattice 7/9, Warden 1/8 | Dead: Wraith, Ghost, Remedy
