## Squads
### Player
- **Viper** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
### Opponent
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Snare** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,2) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (≥6 tiles). I need to move south to close distance. Moving to (1,2) gets me closer to Hawk at (3,1) — distance would be 3, within scan range. I'll move then scan Hawk.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(4,0) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range. TIP says cloak now. I'll cloak first, then move toward Prophet (the enemy damage dealer/priority target) to get into assassination position while invisible.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(1,2) ✓
  💭 Prophet is in range at dist=3 from current position. I can use precision_shot (range ≤2) — wait, dist=3 exceeds precision_shot range of 2. I need to close to range 2. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist=1 from Prophet at (1,2), well within range. From (2,2) I can fire precision_shot at Prophet for 2dmg. Check adjacency: Prophet is at (1,2), I'd be at (2,2) — that's adjacent! precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Move to (3,2) instead — dist to Prophet=(1,2) is 2 tiles (Manhattan: |3-1|+|2-2|=2), within range and not adjacent. I moved so precision_shot deals 1dmg. Better: move to (2,1) — dist to Prophet=(1,2): |2-1|+|1-2|=2, not adjacent, in range, and I moved so 1dmg. Actually stay and just fire — from (3,1) Prophet is at dist=3, out of range for precision_shot (max 2). I must move closer. Move to (3,3): dist to Prophet |3-1|+|3-2|=3, still out. Move to (2,2): adjacent to Prophet, blocks precision_shot. Move to (2,1): dist=2, not adjacent, valid. Fire precision_shot after moving = 1dmg. Or move to (3,2): dist=2, not adjacent. Either works. I'll move to (3,2) and fire precision_shot on Prophet for 1dmg (moved penalty).
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far. Hawk is at (3,2) moving north toward us. I should move south to intercept and place a trap on a likely approach tile. Hawk at (3,2) moving N will likely pass through (3,3) or (3,4). I'll move to (3,3) and place a trap at (3,4) to catch Hawk's advance.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent, so no attack. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy (Hawk at 3,2, dist=3) and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Moving to (2,2) closes distance to Hawk significantly. Enemies are mostly to the south (Viper at 2,0) and Hawk at (3,2) is to the south-east. After moving to (2,2), I'll use shield_wall facing S to cover the southern threat corridor where Viper is approaching. Note trap at (3,4) - avoid it.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(2,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, starting at (2,0). Rampart(sentinel) is at (2,2) directly north, dist=2. My orders are to place traps on tiles enemies likely to move through. Rampart is facing south and likely to advance toward me. Tile (2,1) is directly between us and a natural chokepoint. I can move to (1,1) or (3,1) and place a trap on (2,1) to catch Rampart advancing. I'm not adjacent to any enemy vector so trap is not blocked. I'll move to (3,1) first to get off the direct path, then place a trap on (2,1) which is the likely approach corridor.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Viper 7/7, Veil 5/5, Rampart 11/11, Prophet 5/6, Snare 7/7

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, adjacent to Snare whose denial zone blocks my abilities. I need to move away from Snare first to use abilities. Priority target is Prophet (oracle = damage dealer). I can move to (3,4) which puts me behind Snare, but I need to think about Prophet. Better to move to (2,3) which is directly behind Rampart AND closer to Prophet. From (2,3) I could breach Rampart next turn. But orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer (Prophet). Moving to (1,3) gets me behind Prophet and adjacent for breach — but that's distance 4, too far. Let me check: valid moves include (2,3) at dist ~2. Actually I should move to escape Snare's denial first. Moving to (4,4) or (3,4) gets me out of denial. Then I can shadow_strike Snare (adjacent, keeps cloak) — wait, cloak drops after this turn anyway. I'm at (4,3), Snare is at (3,3) facing S, so (3,4) is behind Snare. Move to (3,4) first to escape denial zone, then shadow_strike Snare from behind (adjacent). This damages the vector disrupting our flank, keeps cloak active through shadow_strike, and positions me for breach next turn.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,1) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Viper placed a trap at (2,1) last turn — avoid that tile. Veil is cloaked and moved to (4,3), currently out of scan range at dist=4 from my position. I should move to get Veil in range. Moving to (1,3) puts me at dist=4 from (3,4) — wait, Veil is now at (4,3) per foresight. From (1,3): dist to (4,3) = 3+0 = 3, in range. But I already scanned Hawk. Priority: scan Viper (dist=3, in range) to reveal their prompt, or reposition to scan Veil. Viper is a vector — knowing their prompt is valuable. Scan Viper at (3,1) from current position (dist=3, within range 4). Viper is not adjacent so scan is not blocked. This deals 1 dmg and reveals prompt. Then move away from Viper's trap zone — avoid (2,1). Move to (1,3) to stay safe and reposition.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm in Snare's denial zone, so precision_shot is blocked. Both Rampart and Snare are adjacent. I need to escape the denial zone first. Moving to (4,2) gets me away from Snare at (3,3) and Rampart at (2,2), breaking the denial. From (4,2), Rampart is at dist=2 which is within precision_shot range, and I won't be adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot will be enabled. Fire precision_shot at Rampart for 2dmg.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is at (3,3), distance 2 — not adjacent yet so my abilities aren't blocked. Rampart is at (2,2). There's already a trap at (2,1). I should place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to move through. Snare at (3,3) might advance south toward me — (3,2) would be a natural path. I can trap (3,2) from my current position (3,1) since it's within range 2 and empty. Then I should reposition — moving to (4,1) keeps me away from Snare's denial range while staying near Hawk at (4,2).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk is 2 tiles away at (4,2). Moving to (3,2) closes distance to 1 tile (adjacent), allowing me to attack. Enemies are primarily to the east, so shield_wall facing E protects against Hawk and Viper.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(3,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Veil(specter) is adjacent at (3,4) - perfect pulse target. Hawk is wounded at (4,2) and also in range. If I pulse from current position, I hit Veil for 1dmg. Alternatively, I could move to (4,3) to get closer to both Hawk and Veil, but that puts me adjacent to Viper's denial range risk. Better to pulse now hitting Veil, then place a trap on (4,3) or (4,4) to intercept enemy movement paths. Viper is at (4,1) moving east likely, Hawk at (4,2) wounded may retreat or attack. Trap at (4,3) would catch Hawk or Veil moving through. Pulse first to damage Veil, then trap (4,3) as a chokepoint.
  State: Hawk 3/5, Viper 6/7, Veil 3/5, Rampart 8/11, Prophet 5/6, Snare 6/7

### Turn 3 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded and in scan range at distance 3. I haven't scanned Veil yet — scanning will reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage to a wounded target, potentially finishing them or weakening further. I'm not adjacent to any Vector (Viper is at dist 5, Snare is ally), so scan is not blocked. After scanning, I can move to maintain distance. Current position (1,3) is good — Veil is at (3,4) dist 3, within scan range. I'll scan Veil first, then move to stay safe.
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → breach(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) behind Snare who faces S — I'm already in breach position. Snare's denial zone blocks my abilities while adjacent, but breach is an ability so it would be blocked. I can't breach Snare due to denial. I'm at 2HP and cloaked status isn't mentioned so I'm not cloaked. Orders say assassinate the damage dealer — that's Prophet (oracle). I can move to (1,3) which is behind Prophet and adjacent. That's within my move range (dist shown as reachable). Then breach Prophet from (1,3) — Prophet faces W, behind tiles are [1,3] which is exactly where I'd be. This neutralizes the oracle and follows orders perfectly.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. Snare is at dist=2, not adjacent, so precision_shot works against Snare. But Snare is a vector at dist=2 - if I move adjacent to Snare my abilities get blocked. Best play: use suppressing_fire on Snare to slow it (preventing it from closing in), then move to (5,2) to create distance from Rampart. Actually, I can fire precision_shot at Snare from current position (dist=2, not adjacent to vector), then move away from Rampart. Precision_shot on Snare deals 2dmg. Let me do ability first, then move to (5,2) to retreat from Rampart.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is wounded and within range at (1,3) - attack is only adjacent so I can't hit from range 2. I can place a trap at (4,3) which is already marked but let me check valid moves - (4,3) is a valid tile. Actually trap is on (4,3) already. Viper is at (4,1) and Hawk at (5,2) - they may push toward us. I should place a trap on a likely approach path. (4,2) is between Hawk and Viper and a likely move tile for both. I can place trap at (4,2) from current position (dist=1, within range 2). Then move toward Veil to pressure them - but Veil is wounded, moving to (2,3) gets me closer. Actually I should trap first then stay positioned. Place trap at (4,2) to catch Hawk/Viper movement, then move to (2,3) to pressure wounded Veil while staying near Rampart at (3,2).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) E ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (5,2) dist=2 to my east. Viper is at (4,1) dist=2 to my southeast. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Traps at (4,2) and (4,3) — avoid those. Valid moves include (4,2) which is trapped, so skip it. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer to Viper. Actually, I should advance east toward Hawk. (4,2) is trapped. No valid safe move directly east. I can move to (3,1) or stay and use shield_wall. Best option: move to (3,1) to position near Viper, then shield_wall facing E toward the two eastern enemies. Wait — orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Hawk and Viper are both dist=2. Moving to (3,1) keeps dist=2 to Viper. Moving to (4,3) is trapped. I'm currently fortified, so staying has value. But orders say advance. Move to (3,1) to approach Viper from the south, then shield_wall East covering Hawk and Viper direction.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart (sentinel) is adjacent at (3,1). I can attack for 1 damage. There's already a trap at (2,1). Snare is approaching from (2,3) and will likely move south/east - placing a trap at (3,2) or (4,2) could intercept. But my Denial passive blocks Rampart's abilities since it's adjacent. Attack Rampart first for damage, then place a trap on (3,2) to catch movement toward our position.
  State: Hawk 3/5, Viper 6/7, Veil 2/5, Rampart 7/11, Prophet 5/6, Snare 4/7

### Turn 4 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders: move away from allies and toward edge, face away from combat. I'm at (0,3) on the west edge. Valid moves include tiles along the edge. Moving to (0,5) gets me to the northwest corner, away from combat. Veil is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded — I could scan but orders say move away. I'll move to (0,1) to go south along the edge away from Veil and the combat cluster, then wait facing west (away from combat).
- **Veil** (specter): attack(2,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 2HP, adjacent to Snare (wounded vector) at (2,3). Snare's denial zone blocks my abilities except basic attack and movement. Breach cooldown 1 turn remaining so can't use it anyway. I'm not cloaked. Priority is assassinating enemy damage dealer - Prophet is the oracle at (0,1). Snare is wounded and right next to me - if I attack Snare I can potentially finish it off with a basic attack (it's wounded). But I need to be careful at 2HP. Best play: attack Snare to eliminate the denial zone threat, then move toward Prophet at (0,2) which puts me behind Prophet for next turn breach. Attack Snare first (basic attack, range adjacent), then move to (0,2) to get behind Prophet.
- **Hawk** (striker): suppressing_fire(3,1) W ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Snare is wounded and worth killing but at dist 4, out of range. Rampart is healthy at dist 3, in range but not priority. I'm at 3/5 HP and adjacent to no enemies. Precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2. Rampart is at dist 3 - out of precision_shot range (≤2). No wounded enemies in range. Best play: move toward Snare to get in range next turn, while staying safe. Move to (4,3) brings me closer to Snare at (2,3) - dist would be 3, still out of range. Move to (3,2) is a trap tile - avoid. Move to (4,2) gets closer but there's a trap at (3,2) blocking direct path. Actually Snare at (2,3) from (4,3) = dist 3, still no shot. Let me wait and fire suppressing_fire at Rampart to slow it, keeping distance safe.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is adjacent at (4,1) to my east. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and suppressed (mv1). Attacking Viper is the clear priority. Stay put to keep fortify active, then attack Viper.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with 3/7 HP, wounded. Hawk is at (5,3) moving west likely, Veil is at (0,2) moving east. Traps already at (4,3) and (4,2) covering Hawk's approach. Veil at (0,2) heading east is a threat — if she moves east she could pass through (1,2) or (2,2). I should place a trap at (1,2) or (3,3) to intercept likely movement paths. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to center while I can trap (3,2) or another key tile. Actually, Veil is wounded at (0,2) moving south — Prophet is at (0,1), so Veil might engage Prophet. I should trap (1,2) to intercept Veil's eastward path. I can move to (1,3) first, then trap (1,2) from there (within range 2). Or stay and trap (3,3) to cover Hawk's approach from east. Hawk is wounded at (5,3) moving north — likely moving toward us. (3,3) is a key chokepoint. I'll trap (3,3) from current position — it's within range 2 (dist=1). Then move toward allies.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → trap(3,0) ✓
  💭 Rampart (sentinel) is adjacent at (3,1) - wounded and right next to me. I can attack for 1dmg, but more valuable is placing a trap. However, trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - Rampart is a sentinel, not a vector, so trap should be fine. Wait - my Denial passive blocks some abilities on adjacent enemies, but doesn't affect my own abilities. Trap requires an empty tile within range 2. (2,1) already has a trap. (3,0) is empty and within range 2 - placing there would catch Rampart if they move south. But Rampart is already at (3,1) going S - they might move to (3,0). Actually I should attack Rampart since they're adjacent and wounded - that's direct damage. Then I can move or place a trap. Let me attack Rampart first (1dmg to finish or weaken), then move to (4,0) or place a trap at (3,0) to cut off escape. Actually trap at (3,0) would be good - if Rampart moves south they hit it. I'll attack Rampart then place trap at (3,0).
  State: Hawk 3/5, Viper 5/7, Veil 2/5, Rampart 5/11, Prophet 5/6, Snare 3/7

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(0,1) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (0,1), I'm already behind them at (0,2), and I have shadow_strike which does 1dmg and keeps cloak. Prophet is the priority target (oracle = damage dealer). Use shadow_strike now to hit Prophet without breaking cloak. Then I can move to reposition — consider moving toward Snare's behind position at (2,3) to set up a breach next turn, but Snare is 2 tiles away so I must not end adjacent to them. (2,3) is behind Snare and reachable, and not adjacent to Snare (Snare is at (1,3), (2,3) is 1 tile east — actually that IS adjacent). Better to move to (1,2) or (0,3) to stay safe and set up future flanking.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge, face away from combat. I'm at (0,1). Valid moves include (0,3), (0,4) which move me away from allies at (3,1) and (1,3) and toward the north edge. Moving to (0,4) gets me furthest from combat. Facing S means facing away from the battlefield interior. No ability needed given orders.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-6, my range is 2). No enemies in range from current position. I need to close distance to get precision_shot on wounded Rampart or Snare. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to both Rampart @(3,1) and Snare @(1,3). From (3,3), Rampart would be dist 2 - in range for precision_shot. Let me move to (3,3) to get Rampart in range, then fire precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so no penalty.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is adjacent at (4,1) and I'm in its DENIAL zone, so only basic attack/movement work. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. Attack Viper. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. I'll attack Viper first, then wait to keep fortify.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(1,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (1,2) - prime pulse target. Hawk is also in range at dist 2. If I pulse from current position, I hit Veil (dist 1). Hawk is dist 2, outside pulse AoE of 1. So pulse hits only Veil. That's worthwhile since Veil is wounded and 1 more damage could threaten. After pulse, I should move to cover a trap-worthy tile. Enemies likely moving: Veil at (1,2) might push north or west. Hawk at (3,3) might push toward allies. I can't trap while adjacent to Veil (denial blocks trap). So: pulse first to damage Veil, then move away from Veil to (2,4) to place a trap on a likely path like (2,2) or stay positioned. Wait - if I pulse first, Veil is still adjacent blocking trap. So move first to break adjacency, then trap. Move to (2,2) puts me away from Veil but closer to Hawk's path. Move to (0,2) breaks Veil adjacency. From (0,2) I can trap tiles enemies might traverse. Actually: pulse now hits Veil (1 tile away) for free damage on a wounded unit. Then move away. Pulse doesn't require breaking adjacency. Do pulse first for damage, then move to (2,4) to set up trap next turn from a safer position.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,1). I can't place traps when adjacent to an enemy Vector (me). I should attack Rampart who is wounded, then move away or hold. Pulse would only hit Rampart (1 enemy adjacent), not worth it over a direct attack. Attack Rampart for 1 damage, then move to (5,1) to stay on flank and place traps next turn away from enemies.
  State: Hawk 2/5, Viper 4/7, Veil 1/5, Rampart 3/11, Prophet 4/6, Snare 3/7

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,3) ✓ → breach(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Prophet (oracle) is the highest-priority target at (0,4) facing N. I can reach (0,3) which is directly behind Prophet (behind tile confirmed). Moving to (0,3) puts me adjacent and behind Prophet, enabling breach. Breach forces Prophet to obey me next turn — neutralizing the oracle's damage output without requiring me to attack (which would be risky at 1HP). I still have 1 breach use available and it's ready. Snare is at (2,4) — I need to avoid going adjacent to it. Path to (0,3): move through (1,3) or (0,2)→(0,3), staying away from Snare. (0,3) is reachable within mv3 and not near Snare. Execute: move to (0,3), then breach Prophet.
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(0,3) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 I am breached — must WAIT and take no offensive actions next turn. But this IS my turn to act before the breach takes effect. Veil is adjacent at (0,3), critical HP, and already acted this round. I can scan Veil (1dmg, already scanned but deals damage) or attack for 1dmg. Veil is at critical — attacking could finish her. Attack is adjacent-only and Veil is adjacent. However, Foresight shows Veil already moved/acted. Attacking Veil at critical could eliminate her. But wait — 'breached' means next turn I wait. This turn I can still act. I should attack Veil (adjacent, critical) to eliminate the flanking specter threat, then move away from her position. Actually the breach order says 'next turn you will WAIT' — so this turn I act normally. Attack Veil to finish her off, then move to safety.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 2HP, wounded. Two wounded enemies in range: Rampart at (3,1) dist=2 and Snare at (2,4) dist=2. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Rampart is wounded sentinel - precision_shot should finish it. Snare is a vector at dist=2 - I must avoid moving adjacent to Snare or my abilities get blocked. I can shoot Rampart first with precision_shot (2dmg, likely kills wounded sentinel), then use suppressing_fire or precision_shot on Snare. I'm currently not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot works. Shoot Rampart first, then shoot Snare.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,1) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Rampart is critical at (3,1), distance 2 - within attack range. I'm at (5,1). I can attack Rampart directly to potentially finish them off. After attacking, I should move to (4,1) to stay closer and maintain pressure, or place a trap. Existing traps at (2,1), (3,2), (3,0) cover Rampart's escape routes well. Attacking Rampart now is highest value - they're critical so 1 damage may finish them. Move to (4,1) first to stay in range, then attack.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Viper is adjacent at (4,1) and in range. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm at 2HP so staying fortified would help, but I need to attack. I'll attack Viper first (already adjacent, no move needed), then wait to keep fortify active. Denial zone blocks abilities other than basic attack/movement, so attack should still work.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with only 1HP - critically wounded. Hawk is adjacent at distance 2 and wounded. I need to place a trap on a tile Hawk is likely to move through. Hawk at (3,3) facing W might move toward (2,3) or (1,3). I should place a trap at (2,3) or (3,4) to catch movement. Then I need to retreat to safety. Moving to (2,5) puts me closer to Prophet and further from danger. Place trap at (3,4) to catch Hawk if it moves north, then retreat north.
  State: Hawk 2/5, Viper 3/7, Rampart 2/11, Prophet 4/6, Snare 1/7 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 7 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am breached — orders say WAIT and take no offensive actions this turn. I must stand down completely.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart(sentinel) is at (3,1), dist=2, critical — precision_shot will finish it. I haven't moved yet so no movement penalty. Snare(vector) at (2,5) dist=3 is also in range and critical, but Rampart is closer threat. After killing Rampart, I can stay put or reposition. I'm not adjacent to Snare so precision_shot isn't blocked. Kill Rampart first, then precision_shot Snare if possible — but I can only use one ability per turn. Take out Rampart with precision_shot (2dmg, critical so likely dead), then wait or reposition.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Rampart (sentinel, critical) is adjacent at (3,1). I'm wounded at 3/7 HP. I can attack Rampart to finish them off, then move to safety. Attack first, then reposition. Avoid (2,1), (3,0), (3,2) - those are traps. Move to (5,1) or (4,0) to stay safe. Actually, let me attack Rampart first to eliminate the critical enemy, then move away from danger.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 I'm at 1HP - extremely vulnerable. Hawk is wounded at (3,3) moving west, likely heading toward (2,3) or (1,3). Trap at (3,4) already exists. I should place a trap on a likely path tile. Moving to (3,5) keeps me near ally Prophet while I can place a trap at (3,4)... wait, trap already there. Hawk moving west from (3,3) might step to (2,3). I can move to (2,4) and place trap at (3,4) - but that's already trapped. Better: move to (3,5) and trap (3,3) where Hawk currently stands or (2,3) where Hawk might move. From (3,5) I can reach (3,3) with range 2. Place trap at (2,3) to intercept Hawk's westward movement.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am breached — must wait and take no offensive actions this turn. I'll wait both actions.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is critical and 2 tiles away at (3,5) — perfect range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so full damage applies. Take the kill shot first, then hold position or reposition. No need to move.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with 3HP, wounded. Prophet is far at (1,5). Traps already placed at (2,1), (3,2), (3,0) covering central approach. I should reposition toward Hawk at (3,3) for mutual support and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Hawk while staying defensible. Then place a trap at (3,1) to cover the approach corridor — enemies moving south would hit it.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no scan needed. I'm at (1,5) with 4HP. Hawk fired precision_shot at (3,5) last turn, so that tile is dangerous. Viper moved to (4,2) and placed trap at (3,1). Traps at (4,3) and (3,4). No allies to recalibrate. Both enemies are out of scan range from current position. I should reposition to get Hawk within scan range (≤4 tiles) but I already know both prompts. Best play: hold position or move to maintain distance. Moving to (3,5) risks Hawk's precision_shot zone. Stay at (1,5) and wait — I'm out of range, enemies are wounded, and I have no productive ability to use this turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(1,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (1,5), distance 4, out of my range-2. I'm at 2/5 HP so I need to be careful. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer while staying away from the traps at (3,2),(3,1),(3,0),(2,1). From (2,4) Prophet would be at dist 3, still out of range. Moving to (2,3) puts dist at sqrt(1+4)~2.2, still out. I need to get to dist≤2 from Prophet at (1,5). (1,4) would be dist 1, (2,4) dist 2 - that's in range! Let me check: from (2,4) to (1,5): |2-1|+|4-5|=2, so dist=2, in range for precision_shot. I can move to (2,4) then fire precision_shot at Prophet.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 2HP, wounded. Prophet is at (1,5), dist=6, out of range. Hawk ally is at (2,4). I have traps at (2,1),(3,2),(3,0),(3,1) already placed. Prophet is wounded and likely moving south/east toward us. I should advance toward Prophet while placing a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Prophet while staying near Hawk. Then place a trap at (3,3) to block the approach corridor between us and Prophet.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Foresight reveals Hawk will precision_shot me at (1,5) this turn — I'm at 3HP and that could finish me. I need to move away from (1,5). Hawk is at (2,4), so I should move to break line of sight or get out of range. Moving to (0,5) or (0,4) keeps distance. Both enemy prompts are already known, so scan is less valuable. I should move first to avoid Hawk's precision_shot, then wait. Moving to (0,3) puts me farther from Hawk and out of easy reach. Actually, moving to (0,4) keeps me on the board edge away from Hawk. Viper is placing a trap at (3,3) so that's not a concern for me. Hawk's precision_shot targets (1,5) — if I move away first, the shot may miss or retarget. Let me move to (0,4) to dodge, then wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded and in range at distance 2. I'm at (2,4) and not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. I can fire at Prophet immediately for 2 damage to finish them off. No need to move first.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 2HP - very low. Prophet is at (0,4) critical but dist=4, out of range. Hawk ally is at (2,4) wounded. I need to place traps to control movement paths. Prophet is at (0,4) heading S, likely to move toward (1,4) or (2,4) or (1,3). I should place a trap somewhere in their likely path. (3,4) is a valid move and would let me place a trap closer to the action. Let me move to (3,4) to get closer, then place a trap on (3,3) which is already trapped... checking trap list: (2,1),(3,2),(3,0),(3,1),(3,3) - (3,3) already has a trap. I should place on (3,4) area or move to block. Move to (3,5) to stay back and safe, then trap (3,4) which is in the path between enemy and ally.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Foresight shows Hawk will precision_shot me at (0,4) this turn. I MUST move to survive. Hawk is at (2,4) range 2, already scanned. Viper at (3,5) is out of scan range (dist 4, need ≤4 but denial zone means adjacent is blocked). I need to escape Hawk's shot. Moving away from (0,4) is critical. Valid moves include (0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,5),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,5),(3,4). Hawk targets (0,4) so I must leave. Viper has traps at (4,3) and (3,4) — avoid (3,4). I should move to a tile that gets me farther from Hawk. (0,1) puts me far from both enemies. After moving, both enemies are already scanned so no scan needed. I could wait as second action since I'm out of useful range for anything.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (0,1), distance 5 — out of range (range 2). I need to close distance. Valid moves toward Prophet: (2,2) gets me closer. Traps at (3,2),(3,1),(3,0),(3,3),(3,4) block eastern approach. Moving to (2,2) brings me to dist 3, still out of range. Moving to (1,3) gets dist ~3.6. Best approach: move to (2,2) then next turn can reach (1,1) or (2,1) — wait, (2,1) is a trap. Moving to (1,3) puts me at dist ~2.8 from Prophet. Actually let me recalculate: from (1,3) to (0,1) = sqrt(1+4)=2.24, still out of range 2. From (2,2) to (0,1) = sqrt(4+1)=2.24. Need to get within 2 tiles. Closest safe tile to Prophet without traps: (1,2) would be dist sqrt(1+1)=1.4 — in range. Can I reach (1,2) in one move from (2,4)? Dist = sqrt(1+4)=2.24 — no, mv2 means 2 Manhattan steps. (2,4)→(1,3)→(1,2) would be 2 steps Manhattan. (1,2) not in valid tiles list though. Valid moves listed: move to (2,2) is listed. From (2,2) to Prophet (0,1) = dist 2.24 — just out. Move to (1,3): from (1,3) to (0,1) = 2.24. Hmm. Best I can do this turn is get closer. Move to (2,2), wait for next turn to close in.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 2HP, very low. Trap field is dense around (3,0)-(3,4). Prophet is at (0,1) critical and far away. My ally Hawk is at (2,2) wounded. I should move toward the action and place traps on likely enemy approach paths. Prophet at (0,1) heading S would move toward (0,2) or similar. I can't reach Prophet. Best play: move to support Hawk and place a trap on a path Prophet might use. (3,3) is already trapped. Move to (2,4) to get closer to Hawk, then trap (2,3) which is between Hawk and Prophet's likely path.
