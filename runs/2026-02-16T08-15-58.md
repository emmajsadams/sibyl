## Squads
### Player
- **Weaver** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Patch** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use foresight to reveal enemy positions and cloaked units. Stay at max range. Use mind_spike on the highest-threat target. Keep distance from enemies."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Viper** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak ✓ → move(1,0) ✗ Can only move 3 tiles
  💭 I need to cloak and position myself behind enemy lines. The Prophet at (1,1) facing North is the closest target at distance 4. I can move to (1,0) to get behind Prophet for a potential breach next turn. I'll cloak first to become invisible, then move behind Prophet.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(1,4) ✗ Cannot use abilities — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I can see Viper at (1,4) and Bolt at (2,5). Viper is in scan range (4) at distance 3, Bolt is out of range at distance 5. I should use scan to reveal any hidden enemies and get intel on their prompts. I'll move to maximize my range coverage while staying safe - moving to (1,3) keeps me at range 4 from both enemies and gives good field coverage.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I need to target the medic (Patch) as ordered. From my current position (2,5), Patch is out of range at distance 5. I need to move closer while maintaining maximum range and avoiding adjacency. Moving to (2,3) would put me at range 3 to Patch with reduced precision shot damage (2dmg), but would also put me adjacent to Prophet at (1,3), violating orders. Moving to (2,4) keeps me at range 4 to Patch (still out of range). I should move to a position that gets Patch in range while maintaining distance from all enemies. Since all movement reduces precision shot damage, I'll stay put and use precision shot on Prophet who is currently in range at distance 3.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is at 3HP and likely needs healing soon. I should move north to get closer to my allies and be in better position to support them. Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Weaver for potential healing and closer to Prophet.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(1,2) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 I need to place traps on likely enemy movement paths. Viper at (1,4) and Bolt at (2,5) are both moving south. Key chokepoints would be around (1,2) and (2,3) - tiles they'll likely pass through to engage our forces. I should move to (1,2) to get in trap range of these positions and support my allies.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(1,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent and wounded - I can finish them with attack. Weaver at (1,2) is a vector like me, so denying their abilities is valuable. After attacking Prophet, I should move to maintain denial on Weaver while controlling the chokepoint.
  State: Patch 6/6, Weaver 6/6, Prophet 2/6, Wraith 5/5, Viper 6/6, Bolt 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,2) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked and need to get behind enemy lines. Prophet is closest at distance 2 and wounded - a priority target. I can move to (1,2) which puts me behind Prophet (who faces N) and also puts me adjacent to both Prophet and Weaver. From there I can shadow_strike Prophet next turn while staying cloaked.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,2) ✗ Position occupied → patch(1,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Prophet is critically low at 2HP and needs immediate healing. I can move north to (2,3) which has a trap, but I need to get adjacent to Prophet at (1,3) to heal them. I'll move to (1,2) to be adjacent to Prophet, then use patch to heal them.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → scan(1,3) ✗ No enemy at target
  💭 Foresight shows Wraith failed to cloak and move far, Bolt will precision shot me, and Viper will attack then move. I'm adjacent to Viper (denial range) so can't use abilities here. Need to move away first, then scan to reveal positions. Moving to (1,5) gets me away from Viper and maintains good range on enemies.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded and in range at (1,5). I can precision_shot from current position for 3dmg to eliminate the wounded target, following orders to secure kills on wounded enemies. No need to move since Prophet is already in range and I want to maintain maximum distance.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(1,3) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 I can see Viper at (0,3) is within range 2 for my trap ability. There's already a trap at (2,3), and I should place another strategic trap. Viper is likely to move toward our position, so I'll trap (1,3) to block their advance path. Then I'll move to (2,1) to stay close to Patch for mutual support while maintaining good positioning.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I need to control chokepoints and deny enemy abilities. The enemy Patch is at (2,2) and Weaver at (2,1). I should move closer to deny their abilities and place a trap in a strategic position. Moving to (1,3) would put me adjacent to potential enemy movement paths and allow me to place a trap at (2,2) to threaten Patch's position.
  State: Patch 6/6, Weaver 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Viper 4/6, Bolt 5/5 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 3 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,2) ✓ → cloak ✓
  💭 Need to cloak first to become invisible, then move closer to enemy lines. Patch at (2,2) facing N has behind tile at (2,1), but Weaver is already there. I should move to (1,2) to get closer while staying safe, then cloak to become invisible for next turn's approach.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is my frontliner at (2,1) with 6HP. There's a trap at (2,3) which I need to avoid. Viper is at (1,3) and Bolt at (2,5). No immediate healing needed since Weaver is at full health. I should position to support Weaver while staying safe. Moving to (3,2) keeps me adjacent to Weaver for future healing while staying out of enemy range and avoiding the trap.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 From (2,5), I can see both enemies at range 4. Per orders, I should target the medic Patch since no one is wounded. If I move to (4,5), I maintain range 4 to Patch while moving away from the cluster of enemies, but precision shot would be reduced to 2dmg. If I stay put, I can use full 3dmg precision shot. Since both enemies are healthy and I need to prioritize the medic, I'll stay and use precision_shot on Patch for maximum damage.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(1,2) ✗ Position occupied → trap(1,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 I need to place traps on key movement paths. Viper at (1,3) is likely to move toward our position or Patch. Bolt at (2,5) may advance south. I should move to (1,2) to get closer to support Patch while placing a trap at (1,4) - a likely path for Viper to approach either of us.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 I need to control chokepoints with traps. Looking at the battlefield, Weaver is at (2,1) and Patch is at (3,2). My allies are Wraith at (1,2) and Bolt at (2,5). I should place a trap between the enemies and my allies to control movement. Position (2,2) would be ideal as it's between Weaver and where my allies might move, and it's within my trap range of 2. I'll move to (2,3) to get better positioning and then place a trap at (2,2).
  State: Patch 3/6, Weaver 6/6, Wraith 5/5, Viper 2/6, Bolt 5/5 | Dead: Prophet

### Turn 4 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✗ Cannot use abilities — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm cloaked at (1,2). There's a trap at (2,2) which is behind both enemies. Patch (medic) is wounded and facing E, making them a priority target. I can move to (2,2) despite the trap since I have Ghost Step, then use shadow_strike on Patch from behind while maintaining cloak. This eliminates a wounded enemy healer.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,0) ✗ Can only move 2 tiles → wait ✓
  💭 Weaver is my frontliner at (2,1) with full HP. Wraith specter is adjacent to me at (2,2) and could be a threat. I should move to stay behind Weaver for cover while maintaining healing range. Moving to (2,0) puts me directly behind Weaver and keeps me adjacent to heal if needed.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I have two enemies in range: wounded Patch (medic) at (3,2) and healthy Weaver (vector) at (2,1). Orders say to target the most wounded enemy first, which is Patch. Since I'm at range 4 from both targets and haven't moved, I can use full precision_shot for 3 damage. This should eliminate the wounded Patch medic.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,3) ✗ Out of range (max 2) → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 I have Wraith adjacent at (2,2) and Viper at range 2 at (2,3). My Denial passive means Wraith can't use abilities. I should place a trap to control enemy movement - (3,3) would be a good choke point for enemies moving east. Then I can attack the adjacent Wraith.
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,2) ✓ → trap(1,1) ✓
  💭 Enemy Weaver at (2,1) is 2 tiles away. I need to control chokepoints and deny their abilities. Moving to (2,2) would put me adjacent to deny their abilities, but there's already a trap there from previous turns. I should move to (1,2) to get adjacent to Weaver for denial while staying safe, then place a trap to control the chokepoint at (1,1) to block their southern movement.
  State: Weaver 6/6, Wraith 4/5, Viper 2/6, Bolt 5/5 | Dead: Patch, Prophet

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak ✗ Cannot use abilities — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial) → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm currently at (2,2) and there's a Weaver at (2,1) facing South. I'm already behind the Weaver since they're facing away from me. I should use cloak first to become invisible, then move to a better position to set up for next turn's shadow_strike or breach attempt.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✓
  💭 I need to target Weaver at (2,1) with precision_shot. From my current position (2,5), Weaver is at distance 4 which is beyond my range of 3. I need to move closer. From the recon, moving to (2,4) puts Weaver at distance 3 - exactly at my max range. This allows me to use precision_shot for full 3 damage since I'll still have range 3 from that position. Moving to (3,4) also works but (2,4) is more direct.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse ✓ → move(1,1) ✓
  💭 I have Wraith adjacent at (3,1) and Viper at range 2 at (1,2). My Denial passive prevents Wraith from using abilities. I should use pulse to damage both enemies within range 1 (Wraith is adjacent), then move to a better position. The pulse will hit Wraith for 1 damage.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(1,1) ✗ Cannot use abilities — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial) → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 Weaver is adjacent at (1,1) and wounded. My Denial passive blocks their abilities, so they can only move. I should attack to finish them off since they're at 1 HP. Then I can move to control the chokepoint better or set up for next turn.
  State: Weaver 2/6, Wraith 3/5, Viper 2/6, Bolt 5/5 | Dead: Patch, Prophet
