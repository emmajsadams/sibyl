## Squads
### Player
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
### Opponent
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
- **Patch** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(3,5) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on damage dealer when all healthy. Deadeye is the striker (damage dealer) at (3,5), dist=2. I need to move adjacent to Deadeye first, then overclock. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Deadeye at (3,5). Then I can overclock Deadeye.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away. I should advance toward the center to be in position to support allies. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to both allies and into a central support position. No valid overclock targets adjacent to me currently, so I'll move twice to reposition.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 5 except Patch at dist 4 but still out of range from current position). I need to move closer to get Patch in scan range. Moving to (4,4) would put me 1 tile from Patch at (3,4), well within scan range. But I should avoid getting adjacent to Lattice at (2,4). From (4,4), Lattice is at dist 2, safe. Patch would be at dist 1 (adjacent) - scannable. Move north to (4,4) then scan Patch.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is in range at dist=2 from current position. I'm overclocked so I have 2 ability uses. I should use precision_shot twice on Watcher — I haven't moved so full 2dmg each shot. Watcher has unknown HP but two precision shots should eliminate or heavily wound it. No need to move.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (min dist 4, max range 2). Need to advance to get into range. Lattice at (2,4) is closest at dist 4 but has denial range adjacent - must avoid getting adjacent to it or precision_shot gets blocked. Moving to (2,1) gets me closer while staying on the y-axis toward Lattice/Patch cluster. No targets in range yet so just advance.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(2,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, I'm at (2,4). Watcher is wounded at (4,4) dist=2, Lifeline at (2,2) dist=2. My orders are to control chokepoints with traps. Placing a trap between enemy positions would deny them movement. Lifeline at (2,2) is dangerous as a healer - I should trap the path toward allies. Tile (2,3) is between me and Lifeline, a natural chokepoint on that column. I'll place a trap there. Then I can move to (1,4) to threaten denial against Watcher or reposition. Actually, I'm at (2,4) and can trap range ≤2. Trap at (2,3) cuts off Lifeline's advance north. Then move toward (3,3) to threaten flank and deny Watcher with adjacency next turn.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Watcher 2/6, Lifeline 14/14, Deadeye 5/5, Lattice 8/8, Patch 13/14

### Turn 2 — player
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Watcher (oracle, wounded) is adjacent at (4,4). Orders say use overclock on damage dealer if all healthy. Deadeye (striker) is my damage dealer at (3,5). I'm at (3,4), Deadeye is at (3,5) which is adjacent. I can use overclock on Deadeye. No need to move first.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is wounded at 2/6 HP and 4 tiles away. I need to close the distance to heal. Lattice (vector) is at (3,3) — I must avoid moving adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. Moving to (2,4) keeps me away from Lattice (dist 2) and gets me closer to Watcher at (4,4), dist=2 from (2,4). Still not adjacent after one move, so I'll move toward Watcher as much as possible without getting adjacent to Lattice. Moving to (2,4): Lattice is at (3,3), distance from (2,4) to (3,3) = 2, safe. Watcher at (4,4) is dist=2 from (2,4), not adjacent yet. Best I can do this turn is reposition. No adjacent allies to overclock or heal from current or reachable position this turn.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → scan(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP and Deadeye is targeting me with precision_shot twice this turn. I need to move away from (4,4) immediately to avoid getting hit. Lattice placed a trap at (2,3) so avoid that. Moving to (5,5) gets me away from Deadeye's likely targeting and keeps me at range. From current position I can scan Deadeye at (3,5) to reveal their prompt before moving, but moving first is safer since Deadeye shoots at (4,4). I'll move to (5,5) to reposition, then scan Deadeye who is the priority unscanned target.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Watcher is wounded and in range at dist=2 — priority target. Lifeline is healthy at dist=2. I haven't moved so precision_shot fires at full 2dmg. Fire precision_shot at Watcher to finish them, then precision_shot at Lifeline for pressure.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → suppressing_fire(3,3) ✓
  💭 Lattice(vector) at (3,3) is 3 tiles away — I need to stay out of adjacent range or precision_shot gets blocked. Moving to (2,3) would bring me to dist=2 from Lattice which is adjacent-ish risk. Better to move to (2,2) to close distance while staying safe, then use suppressing_fire on Lattice to slow them before they can close in. Lattice is in range from current position (dist=3, range≤2 for precision_shot so no shot there). From (2,2) Lattice at (3,3) would be dist=2 — within suppressing_fire range. This slows Lattice and denies advance. Deadeye and Patch are out of range regardless.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(2,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so movement is limited to 1. I have a trap already at (2,3) which is good chokepoint control. Lifeline is at (2,4) and Longshot at (2,2) - both in range at dist=2. I should pulse to hit both enemies since they're within range. My position (3,3) with pulse range 1 tile means I need adjacency... actually pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile of me, so I need enemies adjacent. They're at dist=2 so pulse won't reach them. I can attack one of them at range 2. Longshot is a striker threat. I'll attack Longshot to pressure them. I can't place a trap at (2,3) since one is already there. Valid moves: (2,3) has a trap so stepping there is risky. I'll move to (4,3) to maintain position and deny abilities to adjacent enemies, then attack Longshot.
  State: Longshot 5/5, Lifeline 12/14, Deadeye 4/5, Lattice 7/8, Patch 13/14 | Dead: Watcher

### Turn 3 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → patch(3,5) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is adjacent at (3,5) with 4/5 HP - most threatened ally next to me. Lifeline enemy is adjacent at (2,4) which blocks patch/overclock if I stay here. I need to move away from Lifeline to use patch on Deadeye. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Deadeye at (3,5) and away from Lifeline. Then I can patch Deadeye.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → overclock(2,2) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP (Longshot 5/5, I'm 12/14). No healing needed. Longshot is at distance 2 and could benefit from overclock to get an extra action - but overclock requires adjacent. I'm at (2,4), Longshot is at (2,2), so I need to move to (2,3) to be adjacent. Lattice is at (4,3) - distance 3 from (2,3), so I won't be adjacent to it. Then I can overclock Longshot to give them 2 abilities next turn, which is strong with a striker.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Lattice (vector) is at dist=3, in range for precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles... wait, dist=3 is out of range for precision_shot which needs ≤2 tiles). Deadeye and Patch are out of range. I can move up to 2 tiles closer to get Deadeye in range, but I must not move adjacent to Lattice at (4,3). Moving to (3,3) puts me dist=1 from Lattice — too close (adjacent, blocks precision_shot). Moving to (2,4) gets me closer to Deadeye at (3,5): dist=2, in range! And I'd be dist=2 from Lattice (not adjacent, safe). From (2,4), Deadeye at (3,5) is dist=2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so no penalty. Use both overclocked ability shots: first move to (2,4), then precision_shot Deadeye, then precision_shot again (second use from overclocked). Wait — I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2. Still worth hitting Deadeye twice for 1+1=2 dmg total.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is at distance 2 and I'm at (3,5) — precision_shot is valid. I haven't moved so no damage penalty. Shoot Longshot first, then hold position.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is adjacent at distance 2 - my Denial passive blocks her healing abilities. I should move closer to maintain denial pressure on Lifeline while placing a trap between enemies and my allies. Moving to (3,3) keeps me near Lifeline for denial and lets me place a trap at (3,4) to block Longshot's approach path toward my allies at (3,5) and (4,5).
  State: Longshot 3/5, Lifeline 11/14, Deadeye 4/5, Lattice 7/8, Patch 13/14 | Dead: Watcher

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → patch(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) at (3,3), which means my patch and overclock abilities are BLOCKED. I can only use basic attack or move. Longshot at (2,4) needs healing (3/5 HP) but I can't heal while adjacent to Lattice. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone first, then heal Longshot. Moving to (1,4) breaks adjacency with Lattice and puts me adjacent to Longshot at (2,4) — wait, (1,4) is distance 1 from (2,4), so I can heal from there. Let me verify: from (1,4), Longshot at (2,4) is distance 1 = adjacent, so patch works. And (1,4) is not adjacent to Lattice at (3,3) (distance=2). This works.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (3,5) with 4/5 HP, adjacent to me at (4,5) — I can heal them immediately. They're the most wounded and closest. After healing, I'll stay in position to maintain support.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (3,5) dist=2, healthy. Lattice vector at (3,3) dist=2 — I must NOT move adjacent to Lattice or precision_shot gets blocked. I'm at (2,4), not adjacent to Lattice. I can fire precision_shot at Deadeye (dist=2, in range, have LoS). If I don't move first, I deal 2dmg. Deadeye has 4HP so won't kill, but good pressure. After shooting, I can move to (2,5) to reposition away from Lattice while staying at range. Actually, shoot first then move to (2,5) to stay safe.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(2,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (2,5), which means precision_shot is blocked by Vector adjacency rule — wait, the rule says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not adjacent to any enemy. Longshot is a striker, not a Vector. So precision_shot should work. But Longshot is dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles with LoS. However, if I move first I only deal 1dmg. Better to shoot first with precision_shot for 2dmg, then move away to safety. Move to (5,5) to create distance from Longshot and avoid the trap at (3,4).
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(1,5) ✓
  💭 I have a trap at (3,4) already. Enemies are at (2,5) Longshot and (1,4) Lifeline, both dist=3. I need to control the approach path. Moving to (2,4) puts me closer and lets me place a trap at (2,5) or threaten with denial. Actually, moving to (2,4) would put me adjacent to Lifeline at (1,4) - enabling denial to block her abilities. Then I can place a trap at (1,5) or (2,5) to cut off Longshot's movement. Let me move to (2,4) to deny Lifeline's abilities, then trap (1,5) to block the corridor between enemies and my allies at (4,5)/(5,5).
  State: Longshot 3/5, Lifeline 11/14, Deadeye 3/5, Lattice 7/8, Patch 13/14 | Dead: Watcher

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,5) ✓ → patch(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities. I need to move away from Lattice first to enable healing, then heal Longshot who is at 3/5 HP. Moving to (0,4) puts me at distance 2 from Lattice, clearing denial. From (0,4), Longshot at (2,5) is distance 3 — still not adjacent. Let me check: I need to get adjacent to Longshot at (2,5). From (1,5) I'd be adjacent to Longshot (dist=1) and away from Lattice (dist=2). (1,5) is in my valid moves. From (1,5), Lattice is at (2,4) = dist 2, so denial should not apply. Then I can use patch on Longshot.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (5,5) with 3/5 HP, adjacent to me at (4,5). I have 1 patch left. Deadeye is critically wounded and adjacent — must heal now. After healing, I'll stay close to Deadeye for protection.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → precision_shot(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, so precision_shot is blocked. I need to move away from Lattice first to escape the denial zone. Moving to (3,5) puts me at distance 2 from Lattice, escaping denial. From (3,5), Patch at (4,5) is adjacent and Deadeye at (5,5) is at dist=2 which is in range for precision_shot. After moving to (3,5), I can fire precision_shot at Deadeye (dist=2, in range) or Patch (adjacent, but precision_shot works at <=2). Deadeye is the priority striker target. From (3,5), Deadeye at (5,5) is distance 2 - in range for precision_shot. Since I moved, it deals 1dmg instead of 2. Still worth taking the shot on Deadeye.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is at distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. I'm not adjacent to an enemy Vector, so precision_shot is not blocked. Stay in place and fire for max damage.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → pulse(2,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded at (3,5) and in range - pulse hits within 1 tile AoE so I need to be adjacent. I'm at (2,4), Longshot at (3,5) is distance 2. If I move to (3,4) I'm adjacent to Longshot AND there's already a trap at (3,4) - wait, I can't move there if there's a trap. Move to (2,5) instead - that puts me adjacent to both Longshot at (3,5) and Lifeline at (1,5), both within 1 tile. Pulse from (2,5) hits both enemies simultaneously. Lifeline is healthy but Longshot is wounded - pulse could finish or severely wound them. Moving to (2,5) first then pulsing hits both enemies.
  State: Longshot 2/5, Lifeline 9/14, Deadeye 4/5, Lattice 7/8, Patch 13/14 | Dead: Watcher

### Turn 6 — player
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(5,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Deadeye is wounded at (5,5) adjacent to me - I should use overclock on them to boost their damage output since I can't heal. Longshot is adjacent at (3,5) and wounded - attacking is an option but overclock on Deadeye is more valuable. I'll overclock Deadeye first, then attack Longshot.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critical at 1/5 HP and needs healing urgently. I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone which blocks my abilities. I must move away from Lattice first to enable patch, then position to reach Longshot. Moving to (1,4) breaks adjacency with Lattice at (2,5) — distance becomes sqrt(2), not adjacent. Wait, Lattice is at (2,5) and I'm at (1,5). Moving to (1,4) puts me at distance sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, still not adjacent (adjacency is exactly 1 tile orthogonally). Actually (1,4) to (2,5) is diagonal, not adjacent. So moving to (1,4) should clear denial. But Longshot is at (3,5) dist=2 from me. After moving to (1,4), Longshot is at dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, not adjacent. I need to get adjacent to Longshot to heal. From valid moves, (3,4) is reachable and is adjacent to Longshot at (3,5). Moving to (3,4) — is that adjacent to Lattice at (2,5)? Distance is sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, diagonal, not adjacent. So I can move to (3,4) and be free of denial, then patch Longshot at (3,5).
- **Longshot** (striker): attack(4,5) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone, so precision_shot is blocked — only basic attack or movement work. I'm surrounded: Lattice at (2,5) dist=1, Patch at (4,5) dist=1, Deadeye at (5,5) dist=2. Orders say retreat from threats if forced to move. Best move is to (2,4) or (4,4) to break adjacency with Lattice and enable precision_shot next turn. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Patch still, bad. Moving to (2,4) breaks Lattice adjacency, gives distance from Patch. But I still can't use precision_shot this turn. After moving to (2,4), I can attack Lattice (now at dist=1 diagonally — wait, diagonal adjacency counts?) or Patch. Actually (2,4) is adjacent to Lattice at (2,5)? Yes, same column. Let me try (3,3) — moves me away from all three, 2 tiles south. Then I can use basic attack on nothing in range. Actually best: move to (4,4) — dist from Lattice becomes ~2.2 (not adjacent), Patch at (4,5) is adjacent. Or move to (2,4) — Lattice at (2,5) is adjacent still. Move to (3,3) breaks all adjacency. Then attack: nobody in adjacent range from (3,3). So wait as second action. Actually I should move away and attack Patch who is currently adjacent at (4,5) — basic attack is valid while in denial zone. Attack Patch first, then move to (4,4) or retreat.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Lifeline (medic, wounded) is in range at dist=3. Precision shot has range ≤2 tiles, so I need to move closer. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=1 from Lifeline at (3,4) — that's adjacent, which is within precision_shot range (≤2). Wait, adjacent means dist=1 which is ≤2, so precision_shot works. But being adjacent to an enemy Vector would block it — Lifeline is a medic, not a vector, so no issue. From (4,4), Lifeline at (3,4) is 1 tile away, well within range 2. I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Lifeline is wounded so 1dmg might finish them. Actually, let me check: if I stay at (5,5), Lifeline is at dist=3 which exceeds precision_shot range of ≤2. So I must move. Moving to (4,4) costs movement, making precision_shot deal 1dmg. With 2 ability uses (overclocked), I can fire precision_shot twice at Lifeline for 2 total damage. That should be enough to eliminate a wounded medic.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (2,4) - I'm denying their abilities passively. I can pulse to hit both Longshot and Lifeline (Lifeline at dist 2 is outside 1-tile AoE, only Longshot at dist 1 is in pulse range). Better to attack Longshot directly for 1 dmg, then place a trap to control the approach. Actually, I can't trap while adjacent to Longshot (trap blocked by adjacent enemy Vector - wait, I'm Vector, trap is blocked when I'M adjacent to enemy). So no trap this turn. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Longshot at dist 1 qualifies. After pulsing, I could move to (3,5) to get adjacent to Lifeline for denial pressure, or stay and attack. Pulse + attack Longshot would deal 2 total but pulse hits all within 1 tile. Let me pulse first (hits Longshot for 1), then move to (3,5) to deny Lifeline abilities and pressure them.
  State: Longshot 4/5, Lifeline 7/14, Deadeye 4/5, Lattice 7/8, Patch 12/14 | Dead: Watcher

### Turn 7 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone so abilities are blocked. Longshot is wounded at 4/5 HP but I can't heal. Best option is to move away from the denial zone to safety, then attack if possible. Moving to (2,3) gets me away from both Lattice and Deadeye. From there I could try to attack Deadeye if in range, but priority is escaping the denial zone.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Deadeye is critically wounded at 4/5 HP and adjacent at (4,4). I should use overclock on Deadeye to boost their damage output since I can't heal. I'm already adjacent to Deadeye so no need to move first.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4), healthy at 4/5 HP. Deadeye is at (4,4) dist=2, Lattice at (3,5) dist=2. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Lattice is a vector at dist=2 — not adjacent, so precision_shot is NOT blocked. Priority target is Deadeye (striker, healthy but dangerous). Shooting Deadeye with precision_shot from current position (dist=2, in range, no movement) deals 2dmg. Then I can move to (1,4) to create distance from Lattice and maintain positioning. Actually, better to shoot first, then move away from threats.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses this turn. Lifeline is wounded at (2,3), dist=3 which is within range 2? Wait - range 2 means ≤2 tiles. Dist=3 is out of precision_shot range. Longshot is also at dist=3, out of range. I need to move closer to get a kill on wounded Lifeline. Moving to (3,3) puts me at dist=1 from Lifeline (2,3) and I can use precision_shot twice with overclocked. But wait - I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Lifeline is wounded so likely low HP. Move to (3,3) first, then use precision_shot on Lifeline (2,3) - that's adjacent, but precision_shot needs LoS and works at range ≤2. Adjacent is range 1, so that works. With 2 ability uses, fire twice on Lifeline to finish them off, then Longshot is at (1,4) dist=2 from (3,3) - also in range for second shot if Lifeline dies. Actually use both shots on Lifeline to ensure kill, or one on each.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Both enemies are at dist 3, out of range. I need to move closer or place traps in their path. Longshot is at (1,4) and Lifeline at (2,3). Moving to (2,4) puts me distance 1 from Longshot and 2 from Lifeline, enabling denial. I can then place a trap at (2,3) where Lifeline is, or at a chokepoint. Actually, moving to (2,5) then trapping (2,4) creates a mine between enemies and allies. Better: move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Longshot (denial) and trap (2,3) to block Lifeline's movement path toward allies.
  State: Longshot 4/5, Lifeline 6/14, Deadeye 2/5, Lattice 7/8, Patch 12/14 | Dead: Watcher

### Turn 8 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, so only basic attack and movement work. Longshot at (1,4) needs healing but I can't heal. I should move away from Lattice's denial zone to potentially use overclock next turn, and attack Deadeye who is adjacent and wounded. Moving to (1,3) gets me away from Lattice and closer to Longshot. Then attack Deadeye at (3,3) — wait, from (1,3) Deadeye at (3,3) is dist=2, out of melee range. Let me reconsider. I can attack Deadeye now from (2,3) since they're adjacent (dist=1), then move away from Lattice. Attack first, then move to (1,3) to escape denial zone.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Deadeye is critically wounded at 1HP but I cannot heal. I need to move toward the most threatened ally. Deadeye at (3,3) is at 1HP and closest threat. Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Deadeye, then I can overclock them to give them 2 abilities next turn — that's the best support I can offer without heals.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with overclocked (2 ability uses). Lifeline is wounded at (1,3) distance 2 - priority target. Longshot is healthy at (1,4) distance 3. I have precision_shot range ≤2 tiles. Lifeline is at dist 2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg. Use both ability uses: first precision_shot Lifeline to finish them off, then precision_shot Longshot (dist 3 - wait, that's 3 tiles, out of range for precision_shot which needs ≤2). For second shot, suppressing_fire on Longshot to slow them - target Longshot at (1,4) with a 2-tile line. Actually precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, Longshot is at dist 3 so out of precision_shot range. Use suppressing_fire on Longshot instead - range ≤2 tiles... Longshot is dist 3, also out of suppressing_fire range. So second ability has no valid target. I'll precision_shot Lifeline (wounded, dist 2) to eliminate, then wait or use suppressing_fire if I can find a valid target. Since both enemies are at dist 2-3 and suppressing_fire is range ≤2, only Lifeline at dist 2 is in suppressing_fire range too. Kill Lifeline with precision_shot first, then suppressing_fire targeting Lifeline's position toward Longshot's direction won't help since Lifeline will be dead. Second use: I'm at 1HP, staying put is risky. Use second precision_shot... wait I only have precision_shot and suppressing_fire. Second ability: suppressing_fire on Longshot - but dist 3 is out of range. No valid second target. I'll just wait for second action.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(0,4) ✓ → suppressing_fire(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, blocking precision_shot. I need to escape first. Moving to (0,4) puts me 2 tiles from Lattice, clearing the denial zone. From (0,4), Patch at (3,4) is dist=3, out of range. Lattice at (2,4) is dist=2, in range. I can use suppressing_fire on Lattice to slow them and deal 1dmg, buying time. Deadeye is critical but at dist=3+, out of reach this turn.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(1,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so movement is reduced to 1. Both enemies are in range at dist=2. Lifeline is wounded - priority target. I can use pulse to hit both enemies if they're within 1 tile AoE, but they're at dist=2 so pulse won't reach them. Best play: attack Lifeline to finish her off, or trap a chokepoint. Longshot is at (0,4) and Lifeline at (1,3) - they're adjacent to each other. If I move to (1,4), I'd be adjacent to both and could pulse both for 1dmg each. But moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Longshot which is risky. Actually, Deadeye is critical at (3,3) - I should help control the area. Let me place a trap at (1,4) to block enemy movement toward our position, then attack Lifeline who is wounded.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 4/14 HP, adjacent to Lattice (denial zone blocks abilities), no heals left. I need to escape Lattice's denial zone to potentially use overclock later, and survive. Moving away from Lattice is priority. I can move to (2,2) to get distance from both Lattice and Deadeye. Then attack Deadeye if in range, or just wait. Actually, from (2,2) Deadeye at (3,3) is dist=2, still in attack range. Let me move to (0,2) to get further from enemies and out of denial zone.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at 1/5 HP adjacent to me at (3,3) - critically wounded. I have 0 patch uses remaining so I cannot heal. I'm suppressed so movement is limited to 1 tile. Deadeye needs protection but I can't heal. I can use overclock on Deadeye to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could let them attack or escape. Deadeye is adjacent at (3,3). No enemies in melee range so overclock isn't blocked. Use overclock on Deadeye, then wait or stay close.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Cannot use precision_shot — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's denial zone, so precision_shot is blocked. Only basic attack or movement work. Lattice is adjacent at (1,4) and healthy — attacking with basic attack does 1dmg. I should move away to break denial first, then use precision_shot if possible. Best move: go to (2,4) to get distance from Lattice and potentially get in range of Deadeye or Patch. From (2,4), Deadeye is at dist=2 and Patch at dist=1 — both in range for precision_shot. Move to (2,4) first, then precision_shot Deadeye (critical target priority) if LoS exists.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with overclocked (2 ability uses). Longshot is adjacent at dist=2, in range. I should use precision_shot twice on Longshot to eliminate them. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg - Longshot is healthy but 2 hits should take them out. Stay put to avoid losing precision_shot damage.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(0,3) ✓ → trap(0,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Lifeline is at (0,2) wounded, 3 tiles away. I'm at (1,4). My allies are at (3,3) and (3,4). The enemy medic will try to retreat or heal. I should place a trap on (0,3) to cut off Lifeline's escape route northward, then move to (0,4) to apply denial pressure and block their ability usage.
  State: Lifeline 4/14, Deadeye 1/5, Lattice 6/8, Patch 11/14 | Dead: Longshot, Watcher

### Turn 10 — player
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Deadeye at (3,3) is critically wounded at 1/5 HP and is adjacent to me. I should use overclock on Deadeye to give them 2 abilities next turn — they're our damage dealer and need to act fast. Move closer to Lattice is not feasible this turn without abandoning Deadeye. Priority: overclock Deadeye at (3,3) since they're adjacent and critically low.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,2) with 4/14 HP, adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities except basic attack. I have no heals remaining. I need to escape Lattice's denial zone to use overclock on allies, but first priority is survival. Moving away from Lattice is critical. I can move to (1,1) or (0,1) to break adjacency with Lattice at (0,3). Then I can use overclock on an ally if in range. Lifeline is my teammate medic - I should try to get adjacent to use overclock if possible, but I don't know their position. Best move: retreat to (0,1) to escape denial zone, then wait since no heals and no obvious overclock targets in range.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lifeline is wounded at (0,0) but 6 tiles away — out of my range 2. I have 2 ability uses (overclocked) but no enemies in range. Best move: advance toward Lifeline to close distance. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer. From (2,2), Lifeline is still at dist ~3, still out of range 2. Move to (3,1) — dist to (0,0) = 3+1=4, still out. I can move 2 tiles. Best approach: move to (2,2) first, then Lifeline at dist=sqrt(4+4)~2.8, still out. Actually from (2,2): dist to (0,0) = 2+2=4 manhattan. From (3,1): dist = 3+1=4. From (2,1) not available. My max move is 2 tiles. Closest I can get is (2,2) or (3,1) — both dist 4 manhattan. No shot possible. With overclocked 2 ability uses but no targets in range, I'll move closer and wait with second action.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(0,1) ✓ → trap(1,1) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is at (0,0) dist=3, wounded. I'm at (0,3). I should move toward Lifeline to pressure them and place a trap on their likely path. Moving to (0,1) puts me 1 tile away from Lifeline. Then I can place a trap at (0,0) or adjacent to intercept. Actually, let me move to (0,2) first to get closer while staying safe, then place a trap at (0,1) to block their escape route. Deadeye is critical at (2,2) so I need to help create pressure. Moving to (0,1) brings me adjacent to Lifeline at (0,0) - risky but enables denial. Better to move to (0,1) and trap (0,0) directly on top of them - wait, trap goes on empty tiles. Move to (0,2), trap at (0,1) to block Lifeline from moving north.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,0) with 4/14 HP, adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose DENIAL zone blocks my abilities. No heals remaining. I need to escape the denial zone to use overclock, but more importantly I need to survive. Moving away from Lattice is priority. Moving to (2,0) or (3,0) gets me far enough from Lattice. Then I can try to use overclock on an ally if not adjacent to denial. But with 4HP I'm critical - I should flee toward safety. Moving to (3,0) puts distance from Lattice at (0,1). After moving I'm no longer adjacent to Lattice so overclock becomes available. But I have no allies adjacent to use it on. Best play: move away from Lattice to survive.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → overclock(2,2) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Deadeye is critically wounded at 1/5 HP but is 3 tiles away. I need to move toward Deadeye to support them with overclock. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to Deadeye at (2,2) — that would be adjacent. From (2,3) I can use overclock on Deadeye to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could be critical since they're a striker at 1HP who needs to act fast before dying.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,0) ✗ Out of range → precision_shot(3,0) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I have 1HP and overclocked (2 ability uses). Lifeline is wounded at (3,0), dist=3, in range. I can fire precision_shot twice to finish them. I'm not adjacent to any Vector so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved so no penalty. Fire twice at Lifeline.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,1) ✓ → trap(2,0) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is at (3,0) wounded, distance 4 - out of range. Deadeye is critical at (2,2). I'm at (0,1) with a trap already at (1,1). I should move toward Lifeline to apply pressure while placing a trap to protect the approach. Moving to (2,1) gets me closer and within range next turn. Then I can place a trap at (2,0) to block Lifeline's movement north or threaten her position.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 4/14 HP, critically wounded. No heals remaining. Lattice vector is 2 tiles away at (2,1) — I must not move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. I can't heal anyone (0 patches left). Overclock is still available but I need to be adjacent to an ally. No allies visible nearby to overclock. I should move away from the enemies to survive — moving east or south-east keeps me safe. Moving to (5,1) gets me further from the enemy cluster while staying on valid tiles.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (2,2) with 1/5 HP — critically wounded and adjacent to me at (2,3). Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). I should use overclock on Deadeye to give them 2 abilities next turn, maximizing their damage output. Then I can move to stay close to the most threatened ally.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 1HP and overclocked. Lifeline is at (5,1), wounded but 4 tiles away - out of my range 2. I need to move closer to get within range 2. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist 2 from Lifeline at (5,1) - that's exactly in range! From (4,2) I can precision_shot Lifeline. I have 2 ability uses from overclocked. Move to (4,2) first, then precision_shot Lifeline for 2dmg to finish them off.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → attack(5,1) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is critical at (5,1) dist=3, out of my range. Deadeye is also critical at (4,2). I need to advance toward Lifeline to apply Denial pressure and get in range. Moving to (4,1) closes distance to 1 from Lifeline - that would put me adjacent, enabling Denial to block her abilities. I have traps at (1,1) and (2,0) already placed. Moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Lifeline at (5,1), so I can then use pulse or attack. Let me move to (3,1) first then check - actually valid moves include (4,1) which is 2 tiles away. From (4,1), Lifeline at (5,1) is distance 1 - adjacent! I can then attack or pulse. Attack does 1dmg, pulse does 1dmg to ALL within 1 tile. Lifeline is critical so any hit could finish her. Move to (4,1), then attack Lifeline at (5,1).
