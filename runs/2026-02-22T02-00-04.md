## Squads
### Player
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Remedy** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
### Opponent
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Patch** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Orders say to use overclock on my damage dealer when all healthy. Ghost (specter) is adjacent at (4,4), and Marksman (striker) is at dist=2. I should overclock Ghost since it's adjacent. But first, enemies are far away (dist 6-8), so I can stay put or reposition. I'll overclock Ghost at (4,4) to give it 2 abilities next turn - specter with double abilities is a strong play.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away (dist 5-6). I should advance toward the frontline to be in position to heal when needed. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer while staying behind my allies. No ability needed this turn.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(3,undefined) ✗ Out of bounds
  💭 Round 1 with OVERCLOCKED (2 ability uses). Priority: cloak first, then move toward Remedy (the enemy medic at distance 2). I can reach (2,3) which is behind Remedy, but I should cloak first to stay hidden. After cloaking, move to (3,4) to close distance while staying concealed. Next turn I can breach or shadow_strike Remedy. Cloaking now is the TIP-recommended play.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 8, well out of my range of 2. Orders say stay at maximum range and target enemy medic. I should advance toward the enemy medic (Patch at 4,5) while staying safe. Moving to (2,1) gets me closer without approaching enemies, then wait.
- **Marksman** (striker): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy (enemy medic) is in range at dist 3 from my position (5,4). Orders say to target the enemy medic if no one is wounded. I'm at range 3 which exceeds my precision_shot range of 2, so I need to close to range 2. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to Ghost (ally) and at dist 2 from Remedy at (2,4). Wait — Ghost is at (4,4), so I can't move there. Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist 1 from Remedy — too close and might trigger adjacency issues, but Remedy is at (2,4) so dist=1, not adjacent diagonal. Actually (3,4) to (2,4) is dist 1, adjacent. I should stay at range 2. Move to (4,3): dist to Remedy (2,4) = |4-2|+|3-4| = 2+1 = 3, still out of range. Move to (5,3): dist to Remedy = |5-2|+|3-4| = 3+1=4, worse. Move to (3,4): dist = |3-2|+|4-4|=1, adjacent — too close. Valid moves are [3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[5,3],[5,5]. From (4,3), Remedy is at dist 3 still. Hmm, none of the valid moves bring me to range 2 of Remedy. Best option: move to (4,3) to approach, but still out of precision_shot range 2. Actually wait — from current pos (5,4), Remedy at (2,4): dist = 3. precision_shot range is ≤2. I need to get closer. (3,4) would be dist 1 — adjacent, risky. No tile gets me to exactly dist 2 from Remedy this turn without being adjacent. I'll move to (3,4) as closest approach while Remedy is at dist 1 — actually that's adjacent. Instead move toward (4,3) to reposition, and use suppressing_fire if possible, or wait. Actually suppressing_fire range is also ≤2. I can't reach Remedy in range this turn without going adjacent. I'll hold position and wait — orders say stay at maximum range and never move adjacent.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemies are at distance 6, no adjacent targets. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Both enemies are to the north, so I should move north as far as possible. Valid moves include (3,2) which advances 2 tiles north. No adjacent enemies so no attack. Shield wall not useful yet without adjacent allies to protect.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Bulwark 11/11, Remedy 11/11, Marksman 5/5, Ghost 4/5, Patch 11/11

### Turn 2 — player
- **Patch** (medic): patch(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded at (4,4) and is adjacent to me at (4,5). I should patch Ghost to restore HP. After healing, I can move to stay close to allies.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. No enemies in range. I should advance toward my frontliners to stay in healing range. Bulwark is at (3,2) and Bolt is at (2,1). Moving to (3,3) keeps me close to Bulwark and able to support next turn.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 Remedy (enemy medic) is at (3,3) facing S, and I'm behind them. I can move to (3,4) which is directly behind Remedy and adjacent — perfect for breach. Orders say prioritize assassinating damage dealers, but also use breach on sentinels. However, Remedy is a medic who keeps the enemy team alive — eliminating or controlling them is high value. I can move to (3,4) and breach Remedy, making them obey me next turn. Cloak has 1 turn remaining, so I should use it now before it drops. Breach works while cloaked.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy (enemy medic) is in range at dist=3 from my current position (5,4). Orders say to target the enemy medic if no one is wounded. Remedy is healthy so I should use precision_shot on them. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. Stay at current position to maintain max range.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (2,1). Closest enemy is Ghost at (3,4), dist=4, out of range 2. Need to move closer. Orders say stay at max range (2 tiles) and target enemy medic if no one wounded. Patch is the medic. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer to Ghost at dist=2, bringing Ghost in range. From (2,3): Ghost at (3,4) = dist 2, which is within precision_shot range. That's better than targeting Patch at dist=5 from (2,3). Ghost is closer target. Let me check: from (2,3), Ghost at (3,4): |3-2|+|4-3|=1+1=2, in range. I won't have moved this turn if I move first then shoot... wait, precision_shot does 2dmg if not moved, 1dmg if moved. If I move then shoot, I get 1dmg. Still better than waiting. Move to (2,3) to get Ghost in range, then precision_shot Ghost. Orders say target medic if no one wounded - but Ghost is closer and reachable. Actually orders say target enemy medic - Patch is at (4,5), from (2,3) dist=|4-2|+|5-3|=4, still out of range. Ghost at dist=2 is the only reachable target. Shoot Ghost with precision_shot (1dmg since moved).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✗ Position occupied → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Ghost is closest at dist=2, at (3,4). Moving north toward Ghost. Valid moves include (3,1) going south or (4,3) going northeast. Best advance toward Ghost at (3,4) is to move to (4,3) which gets me closer. Then use shield_wall facing N where Ghost and Patch are concentrated.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Bulwark 11/11, Remedy 11/11, Marksman 5/5, Ghost 4/5, Patch 11/11

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(3,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Remedy (medic) at (3,4) facing S — I'm at (3,4) which IS the behind tile. Remedy is adjacent and I'm behind them. Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining so I can't breach. But shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage. I should shadow_strike Remedy first (adjacent, behind), then consider moving. Actually, priority is assassinating the enemy damage dealer (Bolt), but Remedy is right here adjacent and I'm behind them — killing the medic first removes their healing. shadow_strike keeps cloak, so I can strike Remedy then move toward Bolt. Let me shadow_strike Remedy at (3,3), then move to (2,2) to get behind Bolt for next turn breach.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded at (2,2) with 4/5 HP, dist=5. I need to close distance. Valid moves include (2,4) which gets me closer to Ghost. From (2,4) Ghost would be at dist=2, still not adjacent for patch. But I should move toward Ghost to be ready to heal next turn. Moving to (2,4) reduces distance significantly.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (3,3). Allies are at (2,3) and (3,2). Enemies are to the west and north-west. Moving east and toward an edge makes sense. I can move up to 3 tiles. Going to (5,3) puts me far from allies and toward the east edge, away from the western enemies.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (2,2) and Patch is adjacent at (2,4). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Orders say target enemy medic if no one is wounded — Patch is the medic. But both Ghost and Patch are adjacent, blocking precision_shot. I need to move away first to get range. Valid moves: (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3). Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist=2 from Patch(2,4) and dist=2 from Ghost(2,2) — both in range for precision_shot, and no longer adjacent. That satisfies 'maximum range' and allows precision_shot. Target Patch (enemy medic) per orders.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 Remedy (enemy medic) is adjacent at dist=1, but precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I need to move away first. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=1 from Remedy still - no good. Moving to (4,5) keeps dist 2 from Bolt and dist ~2 from Remedy. Actually Remedy is at (5,3), so from (5,5) dist=2, from (4,4) dist=2, from (4,5) dist=2. Orders say target enemy medic if no one wounded. Remedy is at (5,3) dist=1 currently - adjacent, so precision_shot blocked. I must move first to get non-adjacent, then shoot Remedy. Moving to (4,5): dist to Remedy(5,3) = |4-5|+|5-3|=1+2=3 - out of range. Moving to (5,5): dist to Remedy = |5-5|+|5-3|=0+2=2 - in range, not adjacent. Moving to (5,5) then precision_shot Remedy.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) W ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified (50% DR). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Ghost first, then use shield_wall facing West where Ghost and Patch are clustered to protect allies.
  State: Bolt 5/5, Bulwark 11/11, Remedy 9/11, Marksman 5/5, Ghost 3/5, Patch 11/11

### Turn 4 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, away from combat. I'm at (5,3). Allies are at (4,3) and (3,2). Marksman is at (5,5) to my north. I should move south/away from combat. Valid moves include (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) which move me south along the east edge away from both allies and the Marksman threat. Moving to (5,1) gets me far south on the edge.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → patch(2,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded at 3/5 HP and 2 tiles away at (2,2). I need to move adjacent to Ghost to heal. From (2,4), moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Ghost at (2,2). Then I can use patch to heal Ghost for 2HP.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,2) facing N, so (3,1) is directly behind it. I can move to (3,1) and breach Bulwark — this uses my breach on the sentinel as ordered, forcing them to waste their turn. Bolt is the priority target; after breaching Bulwark I'll be positioned at (3,1) near (3,3) which is behind Bolt for next turn.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is the only enemy in range at dist=3, but precision_shot only reaches ≤2 tiles. I need to move closer. Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=1 from Bolt — too close (adjacent risk). Moving to (5,3) puts me at dist=2 from Bolt, within precision_shot range, and not adjacent. From (5,3) I can fire precision_shot on Bolt. I haven't moved yet so no penalty.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic Patch at (2,3) with precision_shot. But first I need to move away from Marksman to avoid the adjacency block. Moving to (5,4) keeps me at range 2 from Patch (dist would be 3+... let me check: from (5,4) to (2,3) = 3+1=4, too far). Moving to (4,4): dist to Patch = 2+1=3, still out of range 2. Moving to (3,3): dist to Patch = 1+0=1, in range, and no longer adjacent to Marksman. From (3,3), Marksman is at (5,3) dist=2, in range. No enemies wounded, so target Patch medic. From (3,3) to Patch (2,3) dist=1, in range. Marksman is dist=2, not adjacent. precision_shot works. But wait - did I move? Yes, moving means 1dmg instead of 2. Still worth it to hit the medic. Actually, let me reconsider: from current pos (4,3), Marksman is adjacent blocking precision_shot. I must move first. Move to (3,3) - not adjacent to any enemy. Then precision_shot Patch at (2,3), dist=1, in range ≤2. I moved so it deals 1dmg.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward corner at (5,1). From (3,2) with mv2, I can reach (5,2) which gets me closer to (5,1). I'll move to (5,2) and wait.
  State: Bolt 4/5, Bulwark 11/11, Remedy 9/11, Marksman 5/5, Ghost 5/5, Patch 10/11

### Turn 5 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (5,0) which is already on the bottom edge. Valid moves include (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) which move along the bottom edge away from enemies. Moving to (2,0) maximizes distance from Marksman at (5,3) and Ghost at (3,1). Then I can wait.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is unavailable. Priority: assassinate enemy damage dealer (Bolt). I'm cloaked. Bolt is at (3,3) facing W - behind tile is (4,3). But I can also hit Remedy at (2,0) - I'm already behind them (facing W, I'm at (3,1) which is east/behind). Remedy is at dist 2, behind tile (3,0) is reachable. Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer - that's Bolt (striker). Move to (4,3) to get behind Bolt, then shadow_strike to stay cloaked and deal damage.
- **Patch** (medic): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP so no healing needed. Bolt (enemy striker) is adjacent at (3,3) and wounded - I should attack to finish them off. My patch ability is blocked when adjacent to enemy anyway. After attacking, I could move toward Ghost at (4,3) to stay near allies.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded and in range at dist=2. Bulwark is adjacent at dist=1 which blocks precision_shot (adjacent enemy). I need to move first to break adjacency with Bulwark, then use precision_shot on Bolt. Moving to (5,4) keeps distance from Bulwark and maintains range to Bolt at dist=3... wait, Bolt is at (3,3) and (5,4) gives dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, so dist=2 in manhattan=3. Range is ≤2 tiles. Better to move to (4,4) — dist to Bolt=(1+1)=2, and no adjacent enemies. From (4,4), Bulwark at (5,2) is dist=3, not adjacent. Then precision_shot Bolt.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so survival is critical. All enemies are healthy, so orders say target the enemy medic (Patch). Patch is at (3,4) - adjacent to me, which means precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Ghost is also adjacent at (4,3). I need to move away first to avoid adjacency, then use precision_shot on Patch. Moving to (2,2) puts me 2 tiles from Patch (dist=sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, but grid distance: |3-2|+|4-2|=3 - out of range). Moving to (2,4): dist to Patch = |3-2|+|4-4|=1, still adjacent. Moving to (1,3): dist to Patch = |3-1|+|4-3|=3, out of range. Moving to (2,3): dist to Patch = |3-2|+|4-3|=2, in range, and no longer adjacent to Ghost(4,3) or Patch(3,4). From (2,3), Patch at (3,4) is dist 2 - in range, and I'm not adjacent to any enemy. precision_shot works. Target Patch the medic.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies toward corner (5,1). I'm at (5,2), so moving to (5,1) satisfies the order and keeps me fortified next turn if I don't move again. No enemies in range, so ability is not useful.
  State: Bolt 1/5, Bulwark 11/11, Remedy 9/11, Marksman 5/5, Ghost 5/5, Patch 9/11

### Turn 6 — player
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so patch is not needed. Bolt is critical and threatening nearby. Marksman is my damage dealer at (4,4), adjacent to me at (3,4). I should use overclock on Marksman to give them 2 abilities next turn to pressure Bolt. Then I can move to stay close to allies.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (2,3) facing W, critical health. I'm at (4,3). I can move to (3,3) which is behind Bolt and adjacent. Then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked — this should finish off the critical striker. Breach is unavailable anyway.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is at full HP, no healing needed. All enemies are out of range. I should advance toward Bulwark to be ready to heal/overclock when needed. Moving to (5,0) gets me closer to Bulwark at (5,1), positioning me adjacent for support next turn.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,1) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (4,4). Closest enemy is Bulwark at dist=4, Remedy at dist=5. My range is 2. I need to close distance. Best move tile to get closer to Bulwark at (5,1) while staying at max range: (5,3) puts me at dist=2 from Bulwark — exactly at max range. From (5,3) I can precision_shot Bulwark. I have overclocked so 2 ability uses. Move to (5,3), then precision_shot Bulwark, then precision_shot Bulwark again (or Remedy if in range). Remedy at (5,0) from (5,3) is dist=3, out of range. So: move to (5,3), precision_shot Bulwark twice.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies toward corner at (5,1). I'm already at (5,1). Valid moves include (5,2) which keeps me near the corner. I'll move to (5,2) to comply, then wait. No enemies in melee range so no attack possible.
  State: Bulwark 10/11, Remedy 9/11, Marksman 4/5, Ghost 5/5, Patch 9/11 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 7 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(5,1) ✓ → patch(5,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded at (5,2) dist=2, needs heal. I need to close to adjacent (dist=1). Moving to (5,1) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (5,2). Then I can patch them.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) facing W, fully healthy. Both enemies are out of range - Bulwark at (5,2) dist 3, Remedy at (5,1) dist 4. Breach is exhausted. Priority is to close distance on Remedy (the enemy damage dealer priority doesn't apply here - Remedy is their medic, Bulwark is sentinel). I should move toward the enemies to get in range. Moving to (5,4) gets me adjacent distance from Bulwark and closer to Remedy. Actually (4,2) puts me at dist 1 from Bulwark and dist 2 from Remedy. Let me move to (4,3) first then shadow_strike Bulwark if adjacent - but (4,3) is dist 1 from Bulwark at (5,2)? No, dist from (4,3) to (5,2) = |5-4|+|2-3| = 1+1 = 2. Not adjacent. Move to (5,2) is Bulwark's position - can't end there. Move to (4,2): dist to Bulwark (5,2) = 1, adjacent! I can shadow_strike. But wait - I'm cloaked? The tip says round 7, don't cloak again. I'm not sure if I'm still cloaked. No cloak status shown. I'll move to (4,2) to get adjacent to Bulwark, then shadow_strike for 1 damage (stays cloaked if I am, otherwise just 1 dmg).
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → patch(5,3) ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded at (5,3) with 4/5 HP and needs healing. I'm at (4,5) with 1 patch use remaining. I need to get adjacent to Marksman to use patch. Marksman is at (5,3), so adjacent tiles include (4,3), (5,4), (5,2). I can move to (5,4) which is distance 1 from Marksman and within my move range of 3. Then use patch on Marksman at (5,3).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,2) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. Orders say never move adjacent to enemies, but I'm already adjacent to Bulwark. I need to move away first. Valid moves: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,5). Moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Bulwark (dist=1 from 4,3 to 5,2 is still 1... wait: |4-5|+|3-2|=1+1=2, so dist=2). From (4,3) I can use precision_shot on Remedy (dist from 4,3 to 5,1: |4-5|+|3-1|=1+2=3, out of range 2). From (4,3), Bulwark at (5,2): dist=2, in range. No wounded enemies, so target enemy medic Remedy. But Remedy is dist=2 from current pos (5,3)→(5,1) — can shoot now but Bulwark is adjacent blocking precision_shot. Must move first. After moving to (4,3): Bulwark dist=2 (in range, can use precision_shot), Remedy dist=3 (out of range). Best I can do: move to (4,3), precision_shot Bulwark (in range, not adjacent). Orders say target medic if no one wounded, but Remedy would be out of range. Shoot Bulwark instead.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,1) W ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,2). I should attack Ghost since it's in range. I'm currently fortified (50% damage reduction) and didn't move last turn. I can attack Ghost and then use shield_wall facing West (where Ghost and Marksman are) to protect ally Remedy at (5,1). Or I can attack first, then shield_wall. Enemies are mostly to the West/Northwest. Shield_wall facing W would block damage from Ghost and Marksman direction.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → overclock(4,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Ghost at (4,2) is wounded but I can't heal. I'm at (5,4), enemies Bulwark at (5,2) and Remedy at (5,1) are nearby. Marksman is full HP at (4,3). I should move closer to Ghost to stay adjacent and potentially use overclock on Marksman (the damage dealer) if I can get adjacent. Moving to (4,4) gets me dist=1 from Marksman and dist=2 from Ghost. Actually, let me move to (4,4) to be adjacent to Marksman and use overclock on him to boost damage output.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Orders say assassinate the enemy damage dealer — that's Remedy (medic). I can reach (5,0) which is behind Remedy and adjacent. Move to (5,0) first, then shadow_strike Remedy at (5,1) — shadow_strike keeps cloak and hits for 1 dmg. Bulwark is adjacent but I can move through enemies via Ghost Step. Priority: get behind Remedy and strike.
- **Remedy** (medic): patch(5,2) ✓ → attack(5,0) ✓
  💭 Bulwark at (5,2) is wounded at 9/11 HP and needs healing. I'm at (5,1) facing N, so Bulwark is adjacent to my north. I can patch Bulwark first, then Ghost at (5,0) is adjacent and in range — I can attack it as my second action. Ghost is healthy but right next to me and could be dangerous. Patching Bulwark is priority per orders, then attack Ghost to deal damage.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(5,1) ✗ Out of range → precision_shot(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Both enemies are healthy, so per orders I target the enemy medic Remedy. Remedy is at (5,1) dist=3 which appears in-range. Bulwark is at (5,2) dist=2. I'll use both precision_shot charges: first on Remedy (medic priority), then on Bulwark. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved so full 2dmg applies.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (5,2) with 10/11 HP. Nearest enemies are Marksman at (4,3) dist=2 and Ghost at (5,0) dist=2. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Marksman is NW, Ghost is S. Moving to (4,2) closes distance to Marksman to 1 (adjacent), allowing attack. After moving I lose fortify but can attack. Enemies are generally to the N and W — shield_wall facing W or N. If I move to (4,2), Marksman at (4,3) is adjacent to the N, so I can attack instead of shield_wall.

- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Marksman at (4,3) is adjacent to me and wounded at 3/5 HP, but I can't heal. Bulwark is at (4,2) dist=2, threatening Marksman. I should stay close to Marksman and use overclock to boost them as the damage dealer. Marksman is adjacent at (4,3), so I can overclock them now.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → patch(4,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost(specter) is adjacent at (5,0) - a threat but wounded. Bulwark needs healing but is dist=2, not adjacent. I need to move closer to Bulwark to heal. Moving to (4,1) gets me dist=1 from Bulwark at (4,2), allowing patch. Ghost is behind me but wounded - acceptable risk to prioritize healing the frontliner.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,1) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Priority target is Remedy (enemy medic) — assassinating healers is highest value. I'm at (5,0) facing S. Remedy is at (4,1) facing W, and (5,1) is directly behind them and reachable. Move to (5,1) to get adjacent and behind, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 2HP, adjacent to Bulwark sentinel at (4,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy. I have OVERCLOCKED so 2 ability uses. Orders say never move adjacent to enemies and target medic if no one is wounded. Both enemies are healthy, so I should target Remedy (medic). I need to move first to escape adjacency with Bulwark and get range on Remedy. Moving to (3,3) puts me at dist 2 from Bulwark and dist ~2 from Remedy at (4,1). From (3,3): Remedy at (4,1) = sqrt(1+4)=2.2, dist=2 tiles (Chebyshev: max(1,2)=2), should be in range. Then I can use precision_shot twice on Remedy with OVERCLOCKED.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (4,2) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies are adjacent. Three enemies are all at dist=2: Marksman at (3,3), Ghost at (5,1), Patch at (4,4). Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Moving loses fortify but I need to advance. Marksman is NW at (3,3), Ghost is SE at (5,1), Patch is N at (4,4). If I move to (4,3), I'm adjacent to Patch at (4,4) and closer to Marksman. Actually Marksman at (3,3) would be dist=1 from (4,3)? No: |4-3|+|3-3|=1, yes adjacent. So move to (4,3) gets me adjacent to Marksman. Then attack Marksman.
  State: Bulwark 11/11, Remedy 7/11, Marksman 1/5, Ghost 3/5, Patch 9/11 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 10 — player
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → overclock(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Marksman is critically wounded at 1/5 HP and is at dist=2 at (3,3). I need to get adjacent to Marksman to use overclock or attack. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Marksman at (3,3). From there I can use overclock on Marksman to give them 2 abilities next turn - they're a striker so extra attacks could be decisive. Bulwark is adjacent to me now at (4,3), but moving west to (3,4) will break adjacency. I should move to (3,4) then overclock Marksman.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy is adjacent at (4,1) and I'm already behind them (I'm at 5,1, they face W so their back is to the E/me). Breach is exhausted. I can shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked, then wait or reposition. Priority is assassinating the enemy medic Remedy before they can heal Bulwark. Shadow_strike keeps cloak active — use it now.
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(5,1) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 No heals remaining and Bulwark is at full HP anyway. Ghost (specter) is adjacent and wounded - I should attack it. No adjacent enemies blocking abilities. I can attack Ghost then move away to safety.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Patch is 2 tiles away at (3,4), Ghost is 3 tiles away at (5,1). Moving toward Patch (closer enemy). From (4,3) I can move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Patch at (3,4)? Patch is at (3,4), distance would be 1 from (4,4) - adjacent! Then I can attack. Let me verify: (4,4) to (3,4) = 1 tile, adjacent. Yes! Move to (4,4) then attack Patch.
  State: Bulwark 11/11, Remedy 6/11, Ghost 2/5, Patch 8/11 | Dead: Bolt, Marksman

### Turn 11 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 No heals remaining. Bulwark is at full HP so no overclock needed there. Enemy Patch medic is at (3,4), distance 2 - I should pressure them or stay safe. Ghost is wounded at (5,1). I have no healing left, so my role is support/pressure. Moving toward (3,3) gets me closer to Patch enemy. Actually, let me move to (4,3) to get adjacent to enemy Patch and attack them, applying pressure. From (4,3) I'd be adjacent to (3,4) Patch. That works.
- **Patch** (medic): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Ghost is wounded at (5,1) but dist=5, not adjacent. Bulwark is adjacent at (4,4) and is a threat. I cannot heal. Best action: attack Bulwark to apply pressure, then consider repositioning. Overclock requires adjacency to an ally - no allies are adjacent. Attack Bulwark with melee since it's in range.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with 2HP, cloaked. Remedy is wounded at (4,3) and I can reach (4,2) which is behind them and adjacent. Moving to (4,2) puts me in perfect position to shadow_strike Remedy — shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1dmg to a wounded target. Let's finish them off.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is adjacent at (4,5) to my north. I should attack it immediately. Ghost is at distance 2, out of range. Orders say attack adjacent enemies first. I'll attack Patch, then use shield_wall facing North where both enemies are concentrated.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Patch** (medic): attack(4,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Ghost is wounded at (4,2) but dist=3, not adjacent. Bulwark (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (4,4) - I'm blocked from using patch/overclock anyway due to adjacent enemy. I should move away from Bulwark to reach Ghost or at least get out of melee danger. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Ghost at (4,2) while stepping away from Bulwark. From (3,3) dist to Ghost would be 2. No heals left so I can try to attack Bulwark before moving, or just reposition. Since patch is gone and overclock is blocked by adjacent enemy, I'll attack Bulwark (1dmg) then move toward Ghost.
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is at 0/3 heals remaining so I cannot heal Bulwark. Two enemies adjacent: Ghost (wounded specter) and Patch (enemy medic). I should attack the wounded Ghost to try to finish it, then move away from the enemy Patch to avoid being cornered. Moving to (5,3) gets me away from Patch while staying near Bulwark.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. Remedy (medic) is wounded and is the priority target - assassinating the enemy healer prevents them from healing Bulwark. I can move to (4,3) which is behind both Bulwark and Remedy, and adjacent to Remedy. From there I can shadow_strike Remedy to finish them off while staying cloaked. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak so this is ideal.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,3) and critical — attack to eliminate. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. No need to move.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is exhausted (0/3 uses). Bulwark is wounded at (4,4) but I can't heal them. Enemy Patch is at (3,3), dist 2. I should move toward Bulwark to support with overclock if possible. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Bulwark at (4,4) — I can overclock them next turn. Also keeps me away from enemy Patch.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,3) ✗ No ally at target → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Remedy is adjacent and wounded - I can use overclock to give them 2 abilities next turn, boosting their effectiveness. I'm already adjacent to Remedy at (4,3). No need to move.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is at (3,3), distance 2 to my SW. I need to advance. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Patch at (3,3). Then I can attack.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent and wounded - attack it. I have no heals left and can't reach Bulwark anyway (dist=2). Attacking the enemy medic is the best use of my turn. Move away after to avoid being adjacent to enemy.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → overclock(5,3) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Remedy is wounded at dist=2, out of reach. Bulwark (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (3,4). I can't heal, so I should move toward Remedy to be in position to support. Moving to (5,3) would be ideal but that's dist=2 from current — I can move up to 3 tiles. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to Remedy at (5,3) while staying mobile. I have no heal to offer, so overclock on Remedy could help. From (4,3), Remedy at (5,3) would be dist=1, in range for overclock. Move to (4,3) first, then overclock Remedy.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is at (4,3), distance 2 from my current position (3,4). I need to advance toward them. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Patch at (4,3), then I can attack. This closes the gap effectively.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 No heals remaining, patch unavailable. Enemy Patch medic is adjacent at (4,3). I can attack them since they're wounded. Bulwark needs healing but I can't heal. Best play: attack the adjacent wounded enemy medic to pressure them, then move away to avoid being stuck adjacent to enemy (which blocks abilities).
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → overclock(5,4) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Remedy is wounded at (5,4) but out of range (dist=2). Bulwark enemy is adjacent at (4,4). I'm at 3/11 HP and need to stay useful. Move toward Remedy to get adjacent and use overclock to boost them, or attack Bulwark. Since patch is gone and Remedy is wounded, I should move to (5,3) to get adjacent to Remedy at (5,4) and use overclock to give them extra abilities next turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 Patch is at (5,3), distance 2. Moving to (5,4) would put me adjacent to Patch, but Remedy is already there. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer. Best move is to (5,4)... wait, Remedy is at (5,4). I can move to (4,3) to be adjacent to Patch at (5,3) — dist from (4,3) to (5,3) is 1 (adjacent diagonally)... actually adjacency is cardinal only. From (4,3) to (5,3) is 1 tile east, so adjacent. I can move to (4,3) then attack Patch at (5,3).

### Turn 16 — player
- **Remedy** (medic): attack(5,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent and critical - attack it to finish it off. No heals left, Bulwark is wounded but out of range. Priority: eliminate the enemy medic to prevent them from healing their team.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with no heals left - extremely vulnerable. Bulwark is adjacent at (4,3), threatening me. I can't patch (0 uses left). I should move away to survive - get distance from Bulwark while staying useful. Moving to (4,5) keeps me near Remedy who is wounded. Then I can use overclock on Remedy to help them contribute more next turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✗ Position occupied → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 Patch is at (4,5), distance 2 to my north. I need to advance. Moving to (4,5) would put me adjacent. Valid moves include (5,4) and (3,4) but moving to (4,5) directly — wait, (4,5) is occupied by Patch. I should move to (3,4) or (5,4) to get adjacent, or move north to (4,4) — but Remedy is there. I can move to (3,4) to get adjacent to Patch at distance ~2, or (5,4). Actually from (4,3) moving to (4,4) is blocked by Remedy. Best is to move toward (4,5): try (3,4) or (5,4) to flank. But (3,4) is in valid moves and gets me to dist ~sqrt(2) from Patch — not adjacent. Actually moving to (4,2) moves away. Let me reconsider: valid moves are listed. (3,4) is valid, dist to Patch(4,5) = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, not adjacent. (5,4) is valid, dist to Patch = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, not adjacent. Neither gets me adjacent this turn. Best approach: move to (3,4) or (5,4) to be 1 diagonal away, then use shield_wall facing N (toward Patch) to protect Remedy.
