(4,3) is a valid move tile, gets me adjacent to Deadeye at (3,4)? dist from (4,3) to (3,4) = 2, not adjacent. Attack Rampart to kill it, then use pulse to clear area or move toward Deadeye. Actually attack Rampart first, if critical it likely dies, then pulse won't have a target nearby. Better: pulse first to hit Rampart (1dmg), then attack Rampart (1dmg) = 2 total damage.
