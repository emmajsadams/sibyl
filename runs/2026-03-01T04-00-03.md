## Squads
### Player
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(2,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, no foresight data yet. Enemy Hawk is at dist=4 from my current position (2,5) but scan shows inRange:false. I need to get closer to scan. Moving south to (2,2) would close distance to enemy Hawk at (2,1) to dist=1 - too close, risky. Move to (2,3) puts me dist=2 from enemy Hawk, well within scan range of 4. But I should stay behind allies - ally Hawk is at (1,4) and Lattice at (4,4). Enemy Hawk is closest threat. I'll move down to (2,2) to get enemy Hawk in scan range (dist=1 is adjacent though - need to avoid that). At (2,3) dist to enemy Hawk = 2, safe and in scan range. Move to (2,3) then scan enemy Hawk.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,2) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 Both Hawk and Prophet are at dist=4 but marked inRange:false from current position. I need to move closer to get them in scan range. Moving to (1,2) brings me 2 tiles north, putting Hawk at dist=2 and Prophet at dist=2-3, well within scan range 4. Priority: scan enemy Prophet to reveal their strategy, as oracle vs oracle info advantage is crucial. After moving to (1,2), Prophet at (2,3) is dist=2, Hawk at (1,4) is dist=2 - both scannable. Scan Prophet first for strategic value. Stay away from Lattice vector at (4,4).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet(oracle) at (1,2) is distance 2 and in range. I'm at (1,4), not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire precision_shot at Prophet for 2 damage. I haven't moved so full 2dmg applies. Then I can hold position or reposition. Staying at (1,4) keeps range on Prophet. No need to move.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Enemy Prophet (oracle) is at (2,3), distance 2 — within precision_shot range. Orders say medics first. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. No adjacent Vector (Lattice is at dist 5), so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire first, then consider repositioning to maintain distance.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies are 5-6 tiles away. I should move toward the center-south to cut off enemy advance paths, then place a trap on a likely approach tile. Enemy Snare is at (3,0) moving north, enemy Prophet at (1,2) moving north, enemy Hawk at (2,0). The corridor around (3,3) or (4,3) is a likely chokepoint. I'll move to (4,3) to get closer and place a trap at (3,3) which is a natural path for enemies advancing from the south.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies out of range. Enemy Lattice (vector) at (4,3) and enemy Prophet at (2,3) are approaching. I need to advance and place traps in chokepoints between enemies and my allies. Moving to (3,2) puts me in a central position and closer to enemies. From there I can place a trap at (3,3) - directly in the path between enemies and my allies, creating a chokepoint. This also gets me closer for denial range against Lattice.

### Turn 2 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(1,4) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded and already scanned. Hawk is healthy at (1,4) and unscanned — scanning Hawk reveals their strategy and deals 1 damage. I'm at (1,2), Hawk is at (1,4) dist=2, in scan range. Lattice is at (4,3) dist=4 but scan requires ≤4 tiles and Lattice has denial range adjacent — not adjacent to me so scan isn't blocked. After scanning Hawk, I should move to maintain distance from threats. Lattice at (4,3) is far. Enemy Hawk used precision_shot on me last turn, so staying at (1,2) is risky. Moving to (0,2) or (0,3) puts me further from enemy Hawk. I'll scan Hawk first, then move to (0,3) to increase distance.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(0,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Prophet at (0,3) is in scan range (dist=2) and not yet scanned. Priority is to scan Prophet to reveal their strategy. I'm at 3/6 HP so I want to stay safe. Snare is at (3,2) — I must not move adjacent to it. Moving to (1,3) keeps me away from Snare and still in scan range of Prophet. Then scan Prophet to reveal their prompt.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-5, max range 2). Need to close distance. Enemy Prophet is wounded and at dist=4 — priority target. Moving toward (3,1) gets me closer while avoiding the trap at (3,3). From (3,1) I still can't reach anyone, but I'll be better positioned. Actually best move is (3,1) to advance toward the cluster. No ability possible this turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Prophet is wounded and within range 2 at (0,3). I'm at (1,4) and haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. No adjacent Vector to block it. Shoot first to kill the wounded Prophet, then wait or reposition.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (3,2), distance 2 — in trap range but I must not move adjacent (would block trap ability). There's already a trap at (3,3). Enemy Hawk is at (3,1) moving south, likely to pass through (3,2) or (3,3). I should place a trap at (4,2) or (5,2) to cover Hawk's approach, or at (2,2) to catch movement toward our allies. Best play: place trap at (4,2) — covers Hawk's likely path if they advance northeast, and I stay at current position to maintain denial pressure on Snare without going adjacent. I'm at (4,3), Snare is at (3,2) — distance 2, so trap is not blocked. Target (4,2) is within 2 tiles and not adjacent to Snare.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(2,3) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Lattice (enemy vector) is at (4,3), dist 2 — in my trap range. There's already a trap at (3,3). I need to control the approach. Moving to (2,2) opens up a trap placement on (2,3) or (3,3) area to block enemies from reaching Prophet who is critical at (0,3). But Lattice blocks trap if adjacent — currently dist 2 so trap is still available from my current position. Best play: place trap at (3,4) to threaten Lattice's position or cut off enemy Hawk at (1,4). Actually, trap at (2,3) would threaten Prophet's approach corridor AND block enemy movement toward our critical Prophet. I'll place trap at (2,3) first, then move to (2,2) to maintain distance from Lattice and cover more ground.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Prophet 1/6, Snare 9/9, Hawk 4/5, Lattice 9/9, Prophet 3/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(1,3) ✓ → move(0,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically wounded. Enemy Hawk will precision_shot me again if I stay exposed. I need to flee. Enemy Prophet is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded - they scanned me last turn. Enemy Hawk at (1,4) will shoot me. I must move away to survive. Valid moves include (0,5), (1,5), (0,4) etc. Moving to (0,5) gets me far from enemies. But I should also recalibrate Hawk(ally) at (3,1) if adjacent - not adjacent. I can move first to escape, then recalibrate isn't possible. Best play: move to (0,5) to escape Hawk's precision_shot range (dist would be ~4 tiles from (1,4) to (0,5) = still in range at 4). Move to (1,5) puts me dist 3 from enemy Hawk. Actually I need to check - enemy Hawk has precision_shot range likely 3-4. I should move as far as possible. (0,5) is distance ~4 from (1,4). Let me move to (1,5) first which is valid, then I have no useful ability since I can't scan (enemy Vector Lattice is not adjacent but scan would be wasted at 1HP - survival first). Move to (0,5) to maximize distance from enemy Hawk at (1,4) - dist = sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 no wait (0,5) to (1,4) = |1|+|1|=2 tiles. That's still close. Best escape: (1,5) then maybe scan enemy Prophet who is wounded to finish? No, scan only does 1dmg and I'm at 1HP. I need to just flee. Move to (1,5) - dist from enemy Hawk (1,4) is 1, too close. Move to (0,5) - dist from enemy Hawk is 2. Hmm. All escape routes keep me in range. Since I'm going to die anyway to precision_shot, I should at least do something useful: attack enemy Prophet (wounded, adjacent at 1,3) to kill them, then move away.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,5) ✓ → scan(0,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical risk with 2HP. Foresight shows Prophet is targeting (0,3) and Hawk used precision_shot on (0,3) - that's where I'd be if I moved west. I need to avoid (0,3). Prophet is at critical HP at (0,5), in scan range (dist=3). Snare is at (2,2), dist=2 - I must not move adjacent to it. My priority: scan Prophet to deal 1dmg (could finish them off since they're critical), but I need to move safely first. Moving to (1,5) keeps me away from Snare and away from (0,3) kill zone. From (1,5) Prophet at (0,5) is dist=2, still in scan range. Snare at (2,2) would be dist=4, safe. This avoids the (0,3) trap that both Prophet and Hawk are targeting.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (2,2), dist 3, in range for precision_shot. I'm at (1,4) and haven't moved yet, so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Snare is healthy so won't kill but good damage. I need to stay away from adjacent to Snare (which is at (2,2)) — adjacent would be (1,2),(2,1),(3,2),(2,3),(1,3). My current position (1,4) is fine, dist 3. I can shoot from here without moving for full 2dmg. After shooting, I'll wait since moving risks getting closer to Snare.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 Lattice(vector) is at (4,3), dist=3, in range for precision_shot. Orders say medics first, then damage dealers — Lattice is a vector (denial unit), worth suppressing. I'm at (3,1) facing N. Lattice is at (4,3), dist=3 which exceeds precision_shot range of ≤2 tiles. I need to move closer. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist=1 from Lattice — but that's adjacent, which blocks precision_shot (vector denial). Moving to (3,2) puts me at dist=2 from Lattice (4,3): dx=1, dy=1 = Chebyshev 1? No, Manhattan dist=2. Precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. From (3,2) to (4,3): Manhattan=2, in range. Also (3,2) is not adjacent to Lattice (Chebyshev dist=sqrt(2) ~1.4, so Chebyshev=1 = adjacent). That would block precision_shot. Better: stay at (3,1) — Lattice is dist=3, out of range. Move to (4,1): dist to Lattice(4,3)=2, not adjacent (Chebyshev=2). From (4,1), precision_shot on Lattice(4,3) — range 2, valid. Not adjacent so not blocked. This works. Check traps: (3,3) and (2,3) — (4,1) is safe.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(1,3) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Traps already at (3,3) and (2,3). Enemies approaching from north: Hawk@(1,4), Prophet@(1,5), Lattice@(4,3). I need to extend the trap line to control the corridor. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to Hawk which is risky. Better to move to (2,1) or hold position and place a trap to extend coverage. Move to (3,2) to stay away from Lattice denial range while placing a trap at (2,3) is already covered. Place trap at (1,3) to block Hawk's southward approach - but I need to be within 2 tiles. From (2,2), (1,3) is distance 2, so I can trap it. Then move west to (1,2) to apply denial pressure on Hawk while staying safe. Wait - Hawk is at (1,4) and moving to (1,2) puts me 2 away, not adjacent. Let me trap (1,3) first then move to (0,2) to avoid being caught.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Hawk is at (4,1), dist=2 and in range. Traps already at (3,3) and (4,2). I'm at (4,3). Hawk is moving east at (4,1) - likely to move north or stay. I can attack Hawk from current position (dist=2, within range 2). But better to place a trap to control approach. (4,2) already has a trap between me and Hawk. I should move to (5,3) to stay out of Hawk's immediate attack range while keeping Hawk in my range, then place a trap at (5,2) to cover Hawk's likely movement path eastward.

### Turn 4 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(1,2) ✓ → recalibrate(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with only 2HP — critically low. Snare is 3 tiles away at (1,2), in scan range and not adjacent so scan is not blocked. Scanning Snare will reveal its strategy and deal 1 damage. I should stay put or move to maintain distance from Snare (must not go adjacent). Hawk ally is at (1,4) between me and Snare, providing some buffer. I'll scan Snare first to gather intel and chip damage, then recalibrate Hawk to boost their effectiveness against the enemy striker.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) is at (5,3), distance 3 - in range for precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles). Wait, dist=3 means NOT in range for precision_shot which needs ≤2 tiles. Check: I'm at (4,1), Lattice at (5,3) - Manhattan distance is |5-4|+|3-1|=1+2=3. Precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, so Lattice is out of range at dist=3. The recon confirms Lattice is 'inRange' for the enemies list but precision_shot specifically needs ≤2 tiles. I haven't moved, so no movement penalty. I need to close to ≤2 tiles from Lattice but MUST avoid adjacent (which would block my abilities). Lattice is at (5,3). If I move to (4,3), dist = |5-4|+|3-3|=1 - that's adjacent, blocked. If I move to (3,3) - that's a trap. If I move to (5,2), dist to Lattice = |5-5|+|3-2|=1 - adjacent, blocked. If I move to (4,2), dist to Lattice = |5-4|+|3-2|=2 - exactly 2 tiles, within range and NOT adjacent. That's valid and in my move list. Then fire precision_shot at Lattice from (4,2).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,2) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Snare(vector) is at (1,2), distance 2 — exactly in precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet so no damage penalty. Snare is healthy but taking it down or wounding it is valuable. However, I need to check: precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Snare is 2 tiles away, not adjacent, so precision_shot is valid. Fire precision_shot at Snare for 2dmg. After shooting, I can move. Hawk is out of range at dist 5. I should reposition to maintain distance from Snare and get better angle. Moving to (2,4) keeps distance from Snare and avoids traps at (3,3).
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Hawk is at (4,2), wounded, distance 2 - in range. Traps already at (3,3) and (5,2). I should place a trap to cut off Hawk's movement options. Hawk is at (4,2) facing N, likely to move toward allies at (2,4) or (1,5), passing through (4,3) or (3,2). I can't trap (3,3) - already has a trap. (4,3) is a valid move tile and would block Hawk's northward path. Move to (4,3) to get adjacent attack range on wounded Hawk, then attack for 1 damage.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Traps already block (1,3),(2,3),(3,3) — good coverage. Enemies are approaching from the north/east. Prophet is at (1,5), dist=3. I can move north to (1,4) to get closer and place a trap at (1,5) to threaten Prophet, or move to block approach. Moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Prophet at (1,5) — denial range blocks their abilities. Then place a trap at (2,4) where enemy Hawk currently stands, or at (0,4)/(1,5) to create more chokepoints. Actually, moving to (1,4) gets me adjacent to Prophet (dist=1), enabling denial on them. Then trap at (2,4) to threaten enemy Hawk or create chokepoint.

### Turn 5 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → recalibrate(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with only 2HP, adjacent to Snare which blocks my abilities. I need to move away from Snare first to escape denial zone. Moving to (0,5) or (2,5) gets me away from Snare at (1,4). Best move: go to (2,5) to maintain distance from Snare and open up scan options. After moving, Snare will be at dist=~1.4 (diagonal), no longer adjacent. Then I can scan Snare or recalibrate Hawk. Ally Hawk is at (2,4) wounded — recalibrate would help. But my orders say scan priority targets. Snare is already scanned. Enemy Hawk is out of range at dist 6. I should recalibrate ally Hawk at (2,4) — from (2,5) that's adjacent. Addendum: focus on eliminating Snare to free up the zone.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm adjacent to Lattice's DENIAL zone at (4,3), which blocks my precision_shot. I need to escape this zone first. Moving to (5,2) gets me away from Lattice and out of denial. From (5,2) Lattice is still only dist=1 but I'll be at a different position. Better to move to (3,1) or (3,2) to increase distance from Lattice and potentially get range on Hawk at (2,4). Moving to (3,2) puts me dist=2 from Hawk, enabling precision_shot. Lattice would be dist=2 from (3,2) as well, so denial zone should not affect me. Then I can use precision_shot on Hawk.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(1,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare at (1,4) which is blocking our oracle with denial zone. Priority is to eliminate Snare immediately. Since I'm adjacent, I must use basic attack (precision_shot is blocked by denial zone when adjacent to enemy Vector). Attack Snare first, then move to (3,4) to get range on wounded Hawk for next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → pulse(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with 5HP. Prophet is wounded at (2,5) distance 2 - high priority target. Hawk enemy is healthy at (3,4) distance 2. My traps are already covering (1,3),(2,3),(3,3) blocking southern approaches. I should pulse now since Prophet and potentially Hawk are within range if I position correctly. Prophet is at (2,5) which is distance 2 from me - just outside pulse range (pulse hits within 1 tile). I need to move closer to Prophet to pulse. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Prophet at (2,5) and within pulse range. From (2,4), pulse would hit Prophet (adjacent) and potentially Hawk at (3,4) is distance 1 from (2,4)... no, (3,4) to (2,4) is distance 1 - yes! Both Prophet and Hawk would be hit by pulse from (2,4). This is ideal - move to (2,4), then pulse to damage both enemies.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk(striker) is at (3,2), distance 2 and wounded. I'm at (4,3). There's already a trap at (3,3) which is between me and Hawk — good chokepoint. Snare is at (2,4), distance 3, so denial doesn't affect me. I should place a trap on a tile Hawk is likely to move through. Hawk is wounded and moving west toward (3,2) — likely paths include (4,2) or (3,3) already trapped. I can place a trap at (4,2) to cover Hawk's approach, or move closer to support allies. Prophet is critical at (2,5). My ally Hawk is at (3,4). I should place a trap at (4,2) to cover the southern approach, then stay at current position to maintain area denial.

### Turn 6 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, adjacent to Snare whose DENIAL is blocking my abilities. I must move away from Snare first to escape denial zone, then I can use abilities. Moving to (1,4) gets me away from Snare and keeps me near allies. After moving, Snare will be at distance 2 — denial cleared. Then I can recalibrate Hawk at (3,4) to boost their effectiveness against the enemy striker. Scan is blocked this turn due to adjacency to Snare, but recalibrate after moving should work. Hawk(ally) at (3,4) is adjacent — recalibrate to help them focus fire on enemy Hawk.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 2HP, wounded. Hawk(striker) is at (3,4) dist=2, wounded — high priority target. Lattice(vector) at (4,3) dist=2 blocks precision_shot if I move adjacent. I have not moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Shooting Hawk at dist=2 with precision_shot from current position (3,2) — need LoS and not adjacent to Lattice. Currently not adjacent to Lattice (dist=2), so precision_shot is available. Fire precision_shot at Hawk (3,4) for 2dmg — this should finish the wounded Hawk. Then I should reposition to maintain distance from Lattice. Move to (2,2) or (4,2) — moving to (2,2) puts me further from Lattice at (4,3) and avoids traps at (2,3),(3,3). Best: fire first (no move penalty), then move to (2,2) to create distance.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(2,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare at (2,4) with DENIAL active, so precision_shot is blocked. I can only use basic attack or move. With 1HP I'm critical — but Snare is wounded so a basic attack might finish it. Attack Snare with basic attack (adjacent, 1dmg), then move away to safety. If Snare is wounded enough to die from 1dmg, this clears the denial zone. Move to (4,4) to escape and get range for next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(1,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (1,4) dist=1, critical — attack to finish it. Hawk at (4,4) is critical and in range 2 — I can pulse to hit both if I stay put, but pulse only hits within 1 tile. Better to attack Prophet first (adjacent, critical), then pulse won't reach Hawk at dist=2. Actually: attack Prophet at (1,4) to eliminate critical enemy, then use pulse to hit... pulse range is 1 tile AoE so it hits (1,4),(2,4) neighbors — Hawk at (4,4) is dist=2, out of pulse range. So: attack Prophet to eliminate, then consider positioning. Or pulse first to hit Prophet at dist=1 (1 dmg) then attack for kill. Prophet is critical so likely 1HP — pulse hits all within 1 tile including Prophet, dealing 1dmg could finish it. Then attack Hawk at dist=2 with attack (range=adjacent only, need dist=1). Attack range is adjacent only so can't reach Hawk at dist=2. Best: attack Prophet (adjacent, finishes critical), then trap at (3,4) to block Hawk's path and threaten Lattice area.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist 3, out of range. Traps already at (3,3), (5,2), (4,2). Enemies Hawk@(2,2) moving W and Snare@(2,4) moving E. Snare moving E toward me could pass through (3,4). I should place a trap at (3,4) to intercept Snare's likely path. I can move to (3,4) first — wait, that would place me on the trap tile. Better to stay put and place trap at (3,4) from current position (4,3): distance = |4-3|+|3-4|=2, within range. But I need to check: am I adjacent to Snare? No, dist=3. Trap is valid. Place trap at (3,4) to intercept Snare moving east. Stay at (4,3) to maintain position.

### Turn 7 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Out of range → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) with 2HP, wounded. Lattice is 3 tiles away at (4,3) — in range for precision_shot but I must not move adjacent. Hawk is at (4,4), out of range at dist=4. Priority per orders: use precision_shot on high-value targets. Lattice (vector) at dist=3 is in range and healthy — good target. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I should shoot Lattice first, then consider repositioning. Moving to (3,2) would keep distance from Lattice (still 2 tiles away) and potentially bring Hawk closer to range next turn. But (3,3) is a trap. Stay at current position or move west to stay safe. Actually, shoot first then move — if I move first I only deal 1dmg. Shoot Lattice at (4,3) for 2dmg, then move west to (1,2) to increase distance from both enemies.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (2,4), distance 2, wounded — in range for precision_shot. I'm at (4,4) and haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Need to confirm I'm not adjacent (dist=2, safe). Snare is the priority target. Fire precision_shot at (2,4) to eliminate it, then wait or reposition. No need to move first since Snare is already in range.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(3,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Snare is critical at (2,4) dist=3, moving toward us likely. Hawk is at (1,2) wounded. I need to stay away from Snare (denial blocks trap). Ally Hawk is at (4,4) critical. Traps already at (3,3),(3,4),(5,2),(4,2). Snare moving east likely passes through (3,4) which is already trapped. Hawk at (1,2) moving right may come through (3,2). I should move to (3,2) to place a trap there as an approach route, but (3,3) already covered. Let me move to (5,3) to maintain distance from Snare and place a trap at (3,2) to cover enemy Hawk's approach — wait, range is 2 tiles, from (5,3) to (3,2) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=2.24, out of range. From current (4,3), (3,2) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41, in range. I'll stay and place trap at (3,2), then move to (5,4) to stay safe and away from Snare.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → pulse(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 2HP - very low. Enemy Hawk at (4,4) is critical (low HP). If I pulse from (3,4) I'd hit Hawk at distance 1. But (3,4) has a trap! I can't move there safely. Traps at (3,3),(2,3),(1,3),(3,4) - those are mine/allied traps or enemy traps? Given my orders are to place traps between enemies and allies, these are likely my traps. Wait - if they're my traps, stepping on them would still hurt me. Let me reconsider. I need to kill the critical Hawk. Pulse hits all within 1 tile from my position - Hawk is at dist 2, so pulse from (2,4) won't reach. I could use attack on Hawk at (4,4) - but attack is adjacent only (dist 1), so can't reach from dist 2. I can't move to (3,4) - trap there. Moving to (3,5) puts me at dist 1 from Hawk at (4,4) - then I could attack or pulse. But I'm at 2HP, very fragile. Pulse from (3,5) would hit Hawk (adjacent). Let me move to (3,5) then pulse to hit Hawk. Lattice is at (5,4), dist from (3,5) would be 2 - not adjacent, so no denial block on pulse. This could finish the critical Hawk.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 5 and 6). I'm at 2/5 HP so I need to be cautious. Traps at (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) block some paths. I should move toward Hawk (critical HP) to get in range for precision_shot. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer (dist would be ~2-3) while avoiding traps. From (3,2), Hawk at (4,4) is dist ~2.2 — still out of range for precision_shot (range 2). Let me reconsider: move to (2,2) keeps me safe, or move to (3,2) to close distance. From (3,2) to (4,4) is sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, still out of range. Best I can do is advance to (3,2) to position for next turn, no ability this turn.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 1HP — critical danger. Snare is 2 tiles away at (3,5) and critical. I need to finish Snare with precision_shot from current position before it acts. Snare is at dist=2, within range, no movement needed so precision_shot does full 2dmg. After that, I'm spent or can reposition. Do NOT move adjacent to Snare. Fire on Snare first to eliminate denial zone.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Hawk is at (3,2) moving east, likely to move toward (4,2) or (5,2). I have traps at (5,2) and (4,2) already covering that path. The trap at (3,4) covers their northern approach. I should move to support my ally Hawk at (5,5) who is critical, and place a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (4,3) keeps me central and lets me place a trap at (3,3) - but there's already one there. Let me move to (4,4) and place a trap at (3,4) - already placed there too. I'll move to (4,5) to stay near ally and place a trap at (4,3) to cover the approach route from (3,2) heading northeast.
