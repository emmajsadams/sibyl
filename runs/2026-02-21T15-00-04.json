Then I can move away from Rampart to get range on Weaver. Best move after attacking: move to (4,2) to stay 1 tile from Weaver (dist=1) — wait, Weaver is at (4,3) so (4,2) would be adjacent, blocked by vector denial. Move to (3,2) instead — dist to Weaver=(4,3) would be sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, still adjacent diagonally. Actually dist=2 tiles from (3,2) to (4,3): |3-4|+|2-3|=2, not adjacent. Safe.

I'm currently at (2,2). Precision_shot range is 2 tiles - Manhattan distance from (2,2) to (0,3) is |2-0|+|2-3|=2+1=3, which is >2. But recon says inRange. I'll trust the recon data. Warning about trap at (2,3) - avoid that tile. I should stay at current position and use precision_shot on wounded Weaver to finish them.

Better to move to (1,3) and place a trap at (2,3) to block enemy advance toward my position. Actually, valid moves include (2,3) directly. If I move to (2,3) I'm dist=1 from Longshot at (2,2) - that's adjacent, enabling Denial. Then I can pulse for 1dmg to Longshot. But I'm at 3HP, getting adjacent to a healthy striker is risky.
