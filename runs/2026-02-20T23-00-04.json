I'm being targeted by Marksman with precision_shot, so I must move away from exposure. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer to Warden and out of current position. From (4,0), Warden at (5,1) is distance 2 — not adjacent, can't patch. Moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Warden at (5,1)? No, dist from (4,1) to (5,1) = 1, adjacent! But Marksman is at (4,2), adjacent to (4,1) — that's dangerous, Vector blocks patch when adjacent to enemy. Wait — Marksman is a striker not a Vector. Only Vector blocks patch. So I can patch from (4,1). But moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Marksman at (4,2) — that's very risky at 2HP. Better to move to (3,0) or (2,1) for safety and use last patch on myself since I'm critically low at 2/9HP. Actually orders say patch Warden, but I'm at 2HP — I might die before helping. Let me move to (4,0) to get near Warden while repositioning, then patch Warden at (5,1)? Dist from (4,0) to (5,1) = sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent. Move to (4,1): adjacent to Warden(5,1), but adjacent to Marksman(4,2) too. Patch is not blocked by striker. I'll move to (4,1) and patch Warden — risky but follows orders. Actually at 2HP I'm nearly dead. Self-preservation: move away. Move to (2,1) keeps distance. But then I can't patch Warden. I'll move to (4,0) — safer than (4,1), still repositioning.

I can't scan while adjacent to enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel not a Vector, so scan should work. However, priority is survival: I'm at 3/8 HP. Move away from Warden first. Best escape: move to (5,5) or (4,5) to gain distance. Then scan Doc at (4,0) — already scanned. Insight is out of range. Warden already scanned. I should move away to safety then wait, or try to scan Doc again for damage. Actually Doc is already scanned. Let me move to (5,5) to escape Warden's melee range, then wait. Or I could move to (4,5) which puts me 2 tiles from Warden. Moving to (5,5) gives max distance. After moving, scan is blocked only by adjacent enemy Vectors — no vectors adjacent. But after moving to (5,5), Doc at (4,0) is dist=5+, out of range. Let me move to (4,4) — dist to Warden=1+1=2, and Doc at (4,0) would be dist=4, still in range for scan. Actually (4,5): dist to Warden = sqrt(0+4)=2, Doc dist = sqrt(0+25)=5 out of range. Move to (5,4): dist to Warden=2, Doc dist=sqrt(1+16)~4.1 out of range. Move to (5,5): safer. After moving, no good scan targets in range. I'll move to (5,5) and wait.",
