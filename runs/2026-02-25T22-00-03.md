## Squads
### Player
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
### Opponent
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist 6-8, max 4). Need to advance to get enemies in range. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer while staying behind allies. After moving, still no enemies in range so I'll wait for second action.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(1,3) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Watcher is in scan range at dist 3. Scan it to reveal its strategy and deal 1 damage. Then recalibrate Weaver (vector, adjacent at 3,4) to boost effectiveness. I'm at (2,5), Weaver is at (3,4) - distance is 2, not adjacent. Bulwark ally at (5,4) is also not adjacent. No adjacent allies to recalibrate. Best second action: move closer to allies while staying back, or wait. Move to (3,5) to stay safe and reposition.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-5, my range is 2). I need to advance toward high-value targets. Lens (oracle) is priority per orders. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying cautious — advances 2 tiles north toward the enemy cluster. No ability possible this turn since nothing is in range.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Weaver at (3,4), dist 5. Advance toward it. Best move is (3,1) to close distance. Most enemies are to the N, so shield_wall facing N after moving.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (4,3), dist=2 and in range. I'm a Vector so my attack range is adjacent only (dist=1), so I can't directly attack Longshot from here. My trap range is ≤2 tiles. I should place a trap on (4,3) or (3,3) to catch advancing enemies. Longshot is likely to move north toward me or stay. Placing a trap on (3,3) covers the path enemies from (3,1) Bulwark would take moving north. Enemy Bulwark is at (3,1) and likely advances north through (3,2) then (3,3). Placing trap at (3,3) is ideal — dist from me at (3,4) is 1 tile, well within range. I can also move to stay near allies. I'll place the trap first at (3,3), then move to (3,3)... wait, can't place trap on tile I'll occupy. Place trap at (3,3) then stay or move elsewhere. Actually I'll place trap at (3,3) from current pos (3,4) — that's 1 tile away, valid. Then move to (4,4) to maintain pressure and stay near ally Bulwark at (5,4).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) W ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (4,3), distance 2 - closest threat. Orders say push forward aggressively. I can move to (5,3) to close distance and then use shield_wall facing W toward allies/enemy cluster. Weaver is at (4,4) to my west - shield_wall W would protect them from threats coming from that direction. Moving to (5,3) keeps me adjacent to the action corridor and closer to Longshot.
  State: Bulwark 8/8, Longshot 4/4, Watcher 5/6, Bulwark 8/8, Weaver 9/9, Lens 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → scan(3,5) ✓
  💭 All three enemies are at distance 4 but scan requires ≤4 tiles, so they're technically in range. However, the range data shows inRange:false for all targets at dist=4 from current position. I need to move closer to get a valid scan. Weaver is a priority threat (trap at 3,3 last turn, denial range adjacent). I must avoid getting adjacent to Weaver at (4,4). Moving to (2,4) brings me closer to Lens at (3,5) - dist would be 2, safely in scan range. Also keeps distance from Weaver. From (2,4), Lens at (3,5) is dist=2, well in range. Weaver at (4,4) would be dist=2, not adjacent so scan not blocked.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → scan(4,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Lens is moving to (3,5) — my current position — to scan me. I should move away. Longshot is at (4,3) and is a priority scan target (damage dealer). I'll move to (2,5) to avoid Lens's scan and stay at range, then scan Longshot at dist=3 to reveal their strategy.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Weaver (vector) whose denial zone blocks my precision_shot. I need to escape the denial zone first. Moving to (4,2) puts distance between me and both Weaver and the enemy Bulwark. From (4,2) I'm no longer adjacent to Weaver, so I can use precision_shot on Bulwark at (5,3) — dist=2 from new position, within range. I haven't moved more than 2 tiles so no movement penalty... wait, (4,2) is 1 tile from current (4,3), so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Bulwark is high-armor sentinel but still a valid target per orders.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Longshot is closest at dist=2, at (4,2). I need to push forward aggressively. Moving to (4,3) brings me adjacent to Longshot at (4,2) - I can attack. Note (3,3) is a trap, avoid it. Moving to (4,3) is valid and closes to melee range of Longshot. Then attack Longshot.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,3) ✗ Position occupied → attack(4,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Longshot is wounded at (4,2) and in range - attacking them is valuable. Watcher is also in range at (2,4). There's already a trap at (3,3). Orders say place traps on likely enemy paths. Bulwark enemy is at (3,1) moving north - likely to pass through (3,2) or (4,2) area. I can't place a trap at (3,3) since it's occupied. I should attack the wounded Longshot to potentially finish them, then consider placing a trap on a likely enemy path like (4,3) or (3,4) which enemies might cross. Actually, I'm adjacent to Longshot (dist=2) so I can attack. But wait - I need to check if I'm adjacent (dist=1) for attack ability which requires adjacent only. Dist=2 means not adjacent, so basic attack won't work. My range is 2 for trap/pulse. Watcher is at dist=2. I can place a trap at (4,3) which is between me and the enemy Bulwark's likely path northward. Or move closer to Longshot first. Let me move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Longshot for an attack, and place a trap at (3,3)... but (3,3) already has a trap. Move to (5,3) keeps distance, or move to (4,3) to be adjacent to Longshot at (4,2) for attack. Moving to (4,3) then attacking Longshot at (4,2) makes sense to finish the wounded striker. But I need to check - am I blocked by adjacency to enemy Vector denial? No, I'm Vector myself. Move to (4,3), then attack Longshot at (4,2).
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) E ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Bulwark at (4,3), dist 3. I need to advance. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer (dist 1 from Bulwark). Most enemies are to the N/NE. After moving, use shield_wall facing E to protect Longshot at (4,2) who is wounded and to my east.
  State: Bulwark 7/8, Longshot 2/4, Watcher 5/6, Bulwark 7/8, Weaver 9/9, Lens 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (2,5) — can't scan while adjacent to enemy Vector Weaver at dist 2, but Lens is oracle not vector so scan isn't blocked by Lens. Weaver is at (4,4) dist 2, not adjacent so scan is still available. Priority: Lens is already scanned. Bulwark at (4,3) dist 3 is in scan range and not yet scanned — scan it to reveal strategy. Then move away from Lens to maintain safety. Move to (1,4) to increase distance from Lens while staying in range of enemies.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(1,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Watcher (enemy oracle) at (1,4) is already scanned and is a high priority — it's scanning our allies and recalibrating enemies. It's at dist=2, within scan range (≤4). I should scan it again to deal damage. But first, I need to check adjacency to enemy vectors — Weaver is our ally vector at (4,4), no enemy vectors visible nearby, so scan is not blocked. I can scan Watcher at (1,4) for 1 damage. Then I should consider moving to better position. Enemy Bulwark at (3,3) is healthy and already in scan range. Watcher is the bigger threat as it's revealing our prompts and buffing enemies. Scan Watcher for damage. Then move to (3,4) to maintain range and stay useful next turn. Wait — (3,4) is not in valid moves list. Valid moves include (3,5), (3,4) not listed. I'll move to (3,5) to stay in range of Bulwark and maintain positioning behind allies.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 2HP, facing south. Enemy Bulwark is adjacent at (4,3) — I cannot use precision_shot while adjacent to an enemy (wait, that's vector restriction). Actually precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Weaver(vector) is at (4,4), dist=2, so not adjacent. Bulwark is adjacent at dist=1. I can use precision_shot on Bulwark since the vector blocker only applies when adjacent to a Vector unit. But wait — if I move first, precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. So I should shoot first, then move away. Precision_shot on Bulwark at (4,3) for 2dmg (no move penalty). Then move to (5,3) or (5,2) to create distance from the sentinel. Moving to (5,3) keeps distance from Weaver too. Actually (5,2) is safer — puts me further from Weaver at (4,4). Let me shoot Bulwark first for 2dmg, then retreat to (5,2).
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Bulwark is at (3,3) dist 2, likely to advance toward our cluster. Longshot at (5,2) is wounded and may push toward center. I should place a trap on a likely enemy movement tile. (4,3) or (3,4) are likely chokepoints. My ally Bulwark is at (4,3) so I can't trap there. (3,4) is a natural path for the enemy Bulwark moving north/toward our lines — good trap placement. I'm at (4,4), trap range is ≤2 tiles so (3,4) is distance 1+1=... manhattan dist = |4-3|+|4-4|=1, in range. After trapping, I can stay put or reposition. No pulse opportunity (no 2+ enemies adjacent). Stay near ally Bulwark for mutual support.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) W ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall facing west to protect allies from Watcher or facing south toward Longshot. Longshot is at (5,2) to my SE, Bulwark is W, Watcher is far W. Shield_wall facing W covers the Bulwark/Watcher threat direction and protects Weaver at (4,4) or Lens at (3,5). Actually shield_wall requires an adjacent ally target - Weaver is at (4,4) which is adjacent. Face W to block incoming from Bulwark/Watcher direction.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (4,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark first, then use shield_wall facing E/N where enemies cluster (Weaver at (4,4), Lens at (3,5)). Most enemies are to the N-E, so shield_wall facing E covers Bulwark's direction.
  State: Bulwark 6/8, Longshot 2/4, Watcher 4/6, Bulwark 4/8, Weaver 9/9, Lens 5/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Lens already scanned me last turn and will likely do so again. I should scan Weaver to reveal its strategy — it's healthy and a threat at dist=3. Bulwark enemy is out of range. I can move to (2,4) first to maintain distance from Weaver (still 2 tiles away, not adjacent), then scan Weaver at dist=2. Actually, staying at (1,4) keeps me at dist=3 from Weaver which is safer. Scan Weaver now (dist=3, in range, not adjacent to it), then move to stay safe. Lens is also in range but already scanned. Priority: scan Weaver to learn its strategy.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Lens scanned me at (3,5) and moved to (3,5) — they're now on my position or adjacent. Watcher scanned ally Bulwark at (4,3). Enemy Bulwark attacked (3,3) and shield_walled facing W, so they're blocking that corridor. Trap is at (3,4) so I must avoid that. I'm at (3,5) with 5HP. Lens (enemy oracle) likely just moved to (3,5) — same tile as me or very close. I need to scan enemy Bulwark at (3,3) which is in range (dist=2) to reveal their prompt. Moving to (2,5) keeps me back and away from the trap at (3,4), then scan enemy Bulwark at (3,3) from range. Actually, enemy Bulwark is at dist=2 from current pos — within scan range of 4. I should scan them now before moving. Scan enemy Bulwark first, then move away to (2,5) to maintain distance and avoid being adjacent to Weaver (vector) at (4,4).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with 2HP, wounded but functional. Bulwark sentinel is adjacent at dist=2 and wounded — priority target. Weaver vector is at dist=3 so not adjacent, precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Firing precision_shot on wounded Bulwark at (4,3) should finish or heavily damage it. Then I'll move to (5,4) to increase distance from Weaver and maintain range advantage.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (4,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. If I attack first, I stay fortified. Then use shield_wall facing East to block Weaver and Bulwark threats from that direction. Staying in place preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP and fortified. Bulwark is adjacent at (3,3) and I can attack. If I move, I lose fortify and my damage reduction. At 2HP I need to be careful. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll use ability first to attack Bulwark while fortified, then use shield_wall facing West toward Watcher or facing the enemy cluster. Actually, shield_wall protects adjacent allies from a direction. Weaver is at (4,4) adjacent to me. Shield_wall facing North would protect Weaver from attacks coming from the north (where Bulwark and Longshot are). Let me attack Bulwark first (it's adjacent), then shield_wall N to protect Weaver. Staying put preserves fortify.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (5,4) and wounded - attack to finish. Bulwark enemy is at (3,3) wounded and dist=2. My trap is already at (3,4) which is between me and enemy Bulwark. After attacking Longshot, I should move to threaten or reposition. Enemy Bulwark moving north toward our ally Bulwark at (4,3) might step through (3,4) trap. I'll attack Longshot first, then move to (5,3) to maintain pressure and deny enemy Bulwark with my Denial passive.
  State: Bulwark 4/8, Longshot 1/4, Watcher 4/6, Bulwark 2/8, Weaver 8/9, Lens 5/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(0,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (0,4) distance 3, healthy and scanning our allies. Priority: scan Watcher to deal 1 damage and disrupt their scanning. I already know Watcher's prompt. But Longshot at (5,4) is critical and already scanned — not in range. Enemy Bulwark at (3,3) is wounded and already scanned. Watcher is the active threat scanning us. I should recalibrate an ally or scan. Watcher is in range at dist 3 (≤4). Let me scan Watcher to deal damage. Then I can stay put or reposition. I'm at (2,5), no enemies adjacent so scan is not blocked. Watcher is healthy and active — scan them to deal 1 damage and pressure them.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm Watcher at (0,4) with 3/6 HP. Lens (enemy oracle) is adjacent at (1,4) — this blocks my scan ability per the rules. I cannot scan while adjacent to enemy Vector... wait, Lens is an oracle, not a vector. Weaver is the vector at (5,3), not adjacent. So scan is not blocked. However, Lens is already scanned. I need to recalibrate Longshot (our striker, critical at (5,4)) to boost their effectiveness — but recalibrate is adjacent only and Longshot is too far. My ally Bulwark is at (3,3). Priority: Lens is adjacent and already scanned, enemy Bulwark is critical. I should move toward our striker to recalibrate them, or move away from Lens. Foresight shows Lens scanned (3,3) last turn and moved to (2,5). I should move to get recalibrate range on Longshot at (5,4) — too far. Better to move to (2,4) or (3,4) and recalibrate ally Bulwark at (3,3) to help them. Move to (3,4) puts me adjacent to ally Bulwark at (3,3), then recalibrate them to push the critical enemy Bulwark. That's solid.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,5) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm at 1HP and adjacent to Weaver (vector) whose denial zone blocks my abilities. I must move away from Weaver first to escape the denial zone. Moving to (5,5) puts me 2 tiles from Weaver, clearing the denial. From (5,5) I can still reach Bulwark at (4,3) with precision_shot (dist=2, within range). Bulwark is critical so one more hit could finish them. Moving first, then using precision_shot on the critical Bulwark.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(5,3) W ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP, fortified. Bulwark enemy is adjacent at (3,3). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I should attack Bulwark first, then shield_wall facing West (toward enemy cluster at 3,3 and 3,4). Staying put preserves Fortify bonus for damage reduction.
- **Weaver** (vector): attack(5,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Longshot is critical at (5,5) and only 2 tiles away - I can attack it directly. The enemy Bulwark at (3,3) is wounded and moving toward our ally Bulwark. I'm already at (5,3). I can move to (5,4) to get adjacent to Longshot for a kill, or use my ranged attack from current position. Longshot is at dist=2 which is within my range 2, so I can attack it now. After attacking Longshot, I should place a trap on a tile the enemy Bulwark or Watcher is likely to move through - like (4,3) or (4,4) which are paths they'd use approaching our lines.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) E ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (4,3) and critical — attack to finish it off. I'm fortified so I should not move to keep 50% damage reduction. After attacking Bulwark, use shield_wall facing E to protect against Weaver at (5,3).
  State: Bulwark 3/8, Longshot 1/4, Watcher 2/6, Bulwark 1/8, Weaver 8/9, Lens 5/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is at (3,4), dist 2, wounded — scan it to deal 1dmg and potentially finish it off or weaken further. After scanning, I should reposition. Moving to (2,4) first keeps me at range 2 from Watcher for the scan, stays away from the trap at (4,4), and avoids getting too close to enemies. Actually, I can scan first from current position (1,4) — Watcher is dist 2, within range 4, and I'm not adjacent to any enemy Vector so scan isn't blocked. Then move to (0,4) to stay safe and maintain range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → scan(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Watcher is moving to my position and will recalibrate me, which is good. Enemy Bulwark did shield_wall facing E toward (3,4) — that's my current position. I need to move away from danger. The trap at (4,4) is a hazard. I should move to safety and scan Lens since it's in range and already scanned (but can rescan for damage). Actually all enemies are already scanned. I should recalibrate Longshot who is critical and needs boost, but Longshot is at (5,5) — not adjacent. Bulwark ally is at (3,3) — adjacent. Best play: move away from the shield_wall threat and scan Lens at (0,4) for 1 damage, keeping distance from Weaver. Move to (2,4) to stay safe and away from Weaver, then scan Lens at (0,4) which is dist 3 — within range 4.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✗ Out of range → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical priority is survival. Weaver is 2 tiles away at (5,3); if I move adjacent I lose precision_shot. Bulwark enemy is critical at (4,3) and in range. I should shoot the critical Bulwark with precision_shot to eliminate them, then move away from Weaver to maintain distance. Shooting first (before moving) gives full 2dmg. Target Bulwark at (4,3) with precision_shot, then move to (3,5) to increase distance from Weaver.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 Enemy Bulwark is adjacent at (4,3) and critical — attack to finish it off. I'm fortified (50% DR) and should stay put to keep that bonus. After attacking, use shield_wall facing East to block Weaver's attacks from that direction.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is wounded at (3,3), dist=2, within my range. Longshot is critical at (3,5) and Watcher is critical at (2,4) - both out of range. The existing trap is at (4,4). I should place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to move through. Bulwark at (3,3) facing N may move north toward (3,4) or (3,5) to support Longshot. Placing a trap at (4,3) could catch Bulwark if they move east, or I could place at (3,4) to intercept northward movement - but (3,4) is dist=2 from me so within trap range. Actually I need to check: my trap range is ≤2 tiles. From (5,3), (3,4) is dist=3, out of trap range. (4,3) is dist=1, valid. (4,4) already has a trap. Let me place trap at (4,2) to cut off retreat/movement paths, or at (5,4) which enemies might pass through. Actually best to trap (4,3) - directly between me and Bulwark, likely movement corridor. Then wait as second action since no other good moves.
  State: Bulwark 3/8, Longshot 1/4, Watcher 1/6, Weaver 8/9, Lens 4/6 | Dead: Bulwark

### Turn 7 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical danger. Lens is adjacent at (0,4) and already scanned. I need to avoid dying. Weaver is at (5,3) with denial range adjacent - not a threat at distance. Lens knows to scan priority targets and recalibrate damage dealers. I should move away from Lens to survive, then recalibrate Longshot who is critical but our striker. Moving to (1,3) puts distance from Lens. Then recalibrate Longshot at (3,5) - but that's not adjacent from (1,3), distance would be too far. Let me check: from (1,3) to Longshot at (3,5) = distance 4, not adjacent. Better to move to (2,3) - still 2 from Lens, and closer to Longshot but still not adjacent. Actually I need to recalibrate someone adjacent. Bulwark is at (3,3). From (2,3) that's adjacent! Move to (2,3), then recalibrate Bulwark to focus on Weaver and protect positioning. At 1HP I must prioritize survival over scanning.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher is critical and within scan range at distance 3. I already know Watcher's prompt, so scanning again would waste an action. Instead, I should recalibrate Weaver (our damage dealer vector) to boost effectiveness, but Weaver is at (5,3) — not adjacent to me at (0,4). I can't reach Weaver in one move and then recalibrate. Priority: Watcher is critical and at distance 3 — I can scan to deal 1 damage and potentially finish them off. Move closer isn't needed since Watcher is already in range. I'll scan Watcher to deal damage (they're critical, this might eliminate them), then move to safety or wait.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(1,4) ✗ Out of range → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical condition. Lens (oracle) is in range at dist 3. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Priority is to eliminate or cripple the oracle (medic/support class). Weaver is out of range. I should shoot Lens with precision_shot before considering movement to stay safe.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) E ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 3/8 HP, fortified. No enemies adjacent, so no attack possible. Weaver is at (5,3) dist=2, Lens at (1,4) dist=3. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and shield_wall facing E to block Weaver's flank. If I move to (4,3) I risk the trap. Move to (4,4) instead to get closer to Weaver while avoiding trapped (4,3). Then shield_wall facing E to protect against Weaver advancing west. Moving will lose Fortify but I need to advance per orders.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → pulse(5,4) ✓
  💭 Bulwark is critical at (4,4) and adjacent to my existing trap at (4,3). I'm at range 2 with pulse hitting within 1 tile. Bulwark is at dist=2 so not in pulse range. I can't attack directly (range: adjacent only). Best play: move to (4,4) is not valid. I should move closer to Bulwark to finish it off or place a trap to cut off escape. Moving to (4,3) would place me on my own trap - bad. Moving to (5,4) keeps pressure. Actually, Bulwark is critical - I should try pulse if I can get adjacent. Move to (4,4) isn't in valid moves. Valid moves near Bulwark: (4,3) has a trap, (5,4) gets me to dist=1 from Bulwark at (4,4) - that's adjacent! Then I can pulse. Move to (5,4) then pulse targeting self position to hit Bulwark at (4,4) which is within 1 tile.
  State: Bulwark 1/8, Longshot 1/4, Weaver 8/9, Lens 4/6 | Dead: Watcher, Bulwark
