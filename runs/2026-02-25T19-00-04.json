I can move to (3,0) which puts me behind Lattice and adjacent. But I must NOT move adjacent to Lattice first or breach will be blocked. Wait — (3,0) is behind Lattice, dist=1 from Lattice, and Lattice is at (3,1). Moving to (3,0) means I'm adjacent to Lattice. The caution says avoid moving adjacent to Lattice or abilities will be blocked by Vector's denial aura. But Lattice IS the vector. The denial range blocks cloak/breach when adjacent to enemy Vector. So if I move to (3,0) I'll be adjacent to Lattice (vector) and breach will be blocked. I need to breach from (3,0) which is the behind tile, but being adjacent to a vector blocks breach. This is a trap. Alternative: shadow_strike requires adjacent. I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. If I move to (4,1) that's dist=√2 from (3,1)... actually dist to (3,1) from (4,1) is 1 tile diagonal? No, grid distance — (4,1) to (3,1) is 1 tile away, so adjacent. That also puts me adjacent to Lattice and breach blocked. Actually, any adjacent tile to Lattice is within vector denial. Since Lattice is wounded and I have 1HP, maybe shadow_strike is the play — it's 1dmg and keeps cloak (I'm cloaked). But breach IS blocked adjacent to vector. Shadow_strike is an attack ability, not breach/cloak, so it should NOT be blocked by vector denial (denial blocks cloak/breach only). I'll move to (4,1) — adjacent to Lattice at (3,1) — and shadow_strike for 1 damage to finish Lattice. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak.",

Watcher at (2,2) moving E could step into (3,2) trap. Doc at (2,3) moving S could hit (2,1) or (3,3). I should move closer to threaten but stay safe. Move to (3,1) to stay near trap coverage zone and get closer. Then place a trap at (3,0) or (4,0) to extend denial zone. Actually (3,1) is a valid move tile - from there I can place trap at (2,1) area but that's already trapped. Let me move to (3,0) and trap (3,1) which is a likely path. Or move to (4,2) and trap (4,3) - already trapped. Best: move to (3,1), trap (2,1) - already trapped. Move to (3,0), trap (3,1) - that's a gap in coverage between existing traps.",
