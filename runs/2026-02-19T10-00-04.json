From (4,2) I have no adjacent enemies so High Ground passive applies (+1 rng = 4), but precision_shot has range ≤3. Moving to (4,2) makes dist=3 to Snare — exactly in range.

Pulse hits all within 1 tile of target - if I target (3,4) it hits Pulse(medic) and possibly Grid if Grid is adjacent, but Grid is at (2,4) which is 1 tile from (3,4), so pulse centered on (3,4) would hit both Pulse and Grid! That's excellent. After pulsing, I should place a trap to control the area. Grid is at (2,4) moving west, trap at (2,3) already exists. I could move to (5,4) then pulse, but current position already has Pulse in range. Let me pulse (3,4) to hit both wounded Pulse and Grid for 1dmg each, then move toward safety or place a trap. Actually I should move first to maintain distance from Grid. Moving to (5,4) keeps me away from Grid while still having pulse range. From (5,4), distance to (3,4) is 2, still in range. Then pulse (3,4) hitting Pulse and Grid. Wait - pulse range is 1 tile AoE centered within 1 tile of me. My range is 1 tile, so I can only target tiles adjacent to me. From (4,5): adjacent tiles are (3,5),(5,5),(4,4),(4,5). Pulse centered on (4,4) would hit (3,4)=Pulse and (4,5)=me... Pulse says range:1 tile AoE. So I pulse a tile within 1 tile of me, hitting all units within 1 tile of THAT tile. From (4,5), targeting (4,4): hits (3,4)=Pulse(medic), (5,4), (4,5)=me, (4,3), (3,4). Yes, Pulse(medic) at (3,4) is 1 tile from (4,4). Grid at (2,4) is 2 tiles from (4,4), not hit. So pulse (4,4) hits wounded Pulse for 1dmg. Then place a trap at (3,5) to block their advance path.",
