## Squads
### Player
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
### Opponent
- **Grid** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (min dist=5, need ≤4). I need to advance north to get closer. Moving to (4,3) gets me 3 tiles closer. From (4,3), Bolt at (3,4) would be dist=2, in range. Let me move north to (4,3) to get Bolt in scan range.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(2,0) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. All enemies are 5+ tiles away, no threat to cloak. After cloaking, advance north toward enemy lines. Moving to (2,3) gets me 3 tiles closer to Bolt at (3,4) while staying central.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — use cloak immediately per orders and tip. Then advance toward enemy lines. Watcher at (4,3) is the priority target. Move toward center to close distance while cloaked.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are healthy, so I should target the enemy medic (Watcher/oracle) per orders. I'm at (3,4) with range 2, and Watcher is at (4,3) which is distance 2 - within precision_shot range. No enemies are adjacent so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved so I get full 2dmg. I'll stay at current position to maintain max range and fire precision_shot at Watcher.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded at (3,4), 3 tiles north. I'm at (3,1). Moving to (3,3) puts me directly between allies and enemies, adjacent to Bolt's position if they advance. Shield_wall north to block incoming damage to allies behind me. Fortify won't apply since I'm moving, but positioning is worth it.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Enemies are at dist 3-4, out of range. I need to advance and place traps on likely enemy approach paths. Aegis at (3,3) will likely move north toward us. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer while staying near allies. After moving, I can place a trap at (3,3) or (2,3) area. Actually, moving to (2,4) keeps me near Wraith at (3,5) and Bolt at (3,4), and from there I can trap (3,3) which is where Aegis stands — but trapping occupied tiles may not work. Better to trap (3,4) or (2,3) as likely corridors. Move to (2,4) then trap (3,3) to block Aegis advance.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Shade 4/4, Watcher 8/10, Grid 7/7, Bolt 1/3, Wraith 4/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,5) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile → shadow_strike(3,4) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid (vector) at (2,4) which blocks cloak/breach. Grid faces S so I'm currently to its south-facing side — not behind it. I need to get to (2,5) to be behind Grid for breach, but Grid's denial zone blocks abilities while adjacent. Better plan: move to (2,5) first (behind Grid, still in denial range), then next turn I can breach Grid from behind. Wait — (2,5) is behind Grid and adjacent, but I'd still be in denial zone. Alternative: move away from Grid entirely to attack Bolt. Bolt is wounded and at (3,4) facing S. Behind Bolt is (3,5). I can move to (3,5) to get behind Bolt. From (3,5) I'm adjacent to Bolt and behind it — breach Bolt! But Bolt is only wounded, not the most dangerous. Grid (vector) with denial zone is most dangerous. Let me move to (2,5) — that puts me behind Grid. Then use breach on Grid from behind. But denial zone... the warning says abilities may be blocked when adjacent. (2,5) is still adjacent to Grid at (2,4). I should move away from Grid's denial zone first. Move to (3,5): that's behind Bolt and away from Grid. From (3,5) I can shadow_strike Bolt (adjacent, keeps cloak) for 1dmg, finishing the wounded Bolt. Let me do: move to (3,5), then shadow_strike Bolt at (3,4).
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Aegis is at (3,3) facing N, and I can reach (3,2) which is directly behind Aegis and adjacent. That's the perfect breach position. Moving to (3,2) puts me behind Aegis for a breach next turn. I can reach (3,2) from (3,5) — distance is 3, exactly my movement range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded and already scanned. Wraith is healthy and in range at dist=2 — scan to reveal their prompt. Grid is at dist=3, not adjacent so scan is not blocked. I should scan Wraith to get intel. I can stay at current position (4,3) and scan Wraith at (3,2). No need to move.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 1HP - critically wounded. Aegis is adjacent at (3,3) which blocks precision_shot. Watcher is at range 2. I must move away from Aegis first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (4,5) puts me at distance 2 from Aegis and distance ~2 from Watcher, clearing the adjacency block. Then I can use precision_shot on Watcher (range 2, but I moved so only 1dmg). Actually, both enemies are healthy so no kill secured either way. Best play: move to (5,4) to escape adjacency with Aegis, then use suppressing_fire on Aegis to slow it and deal 1dmg to enemies in the line.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, isolating myself. My allies are at (2,3) and (4,3). Moving to (3,5) takes me toward the north edge and away from both allies. Then I can wait.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (3,5), distance 2 and in range. I can place a trap on (3,4) which is between me and Aegis — a likely movement corridor as Aegis advances south. Then move to (3,3) to stay near Bolt at (5,4) and Wraith at (3,2), supporting allies while maintaining zone control. Watcher is out of range at dist 3.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Shade 4/4, Watcher 7/10, Grid 7/7, Bolt 1/3, Wraith 2/4

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining, so I need to use it wisely. I'm adjacent to Grid (vector) which blocks breach/cloak. Grid faces S, so (3,4) is behind it — I can reach that. But priority: Wraith is wounded and I'm already behind it at current position, but no reachable behind tiles. Bolt is wounded at (5,4), behind tile (4,4) is reachable. Best play: move to (4,4) to get behind Bolt, then shadow_strike Bolt (wounded, kill potential). This gets me away from Grid's denial zone and targets a wounded enemy.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid (vector) which blocks my scan ability. I need to move away from Grid first to enable scanning. Moving to (5,3) gets me distance from Grid while staying in range of Wraith for a scan. From (5,3), Wraith at (3,2) is dist=~2.8, still within scan range 4. Grid will no longer be adjacent so scan unblocked. Wraith is already scanned so I should scan Grid instead — from (5,3), Grid at (3,3) is dist=2, within range 4.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 2HP, uncloaked. Breach is on cooldown (1 turn). I can see a trap at (3,4). Both Aegis and Shade can be approached from behind at (3,4), but that's a trap tile — avoid it. Watcher at (5,3) can be approached from behind at (4,3). Moving to (4,3) puts me behind Watcher and adjacent for shadow_strike. That's the play: move to (4,3) then shadow_strike Watcher for 1 damage while staying cloaked... wait, I'm not cloaked. At 2HP I'm fragile. Let me move to (4,3) to get adjacent/behind Watcher and shadow_strike — shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked, so it's just a 1dmg adjacent attack. Still worth it to chip Watcher. Moving to (4,3) is reachable (dist=1 from behind check). Actually my move range is 3, so I can get there. Then shadow_strike Watcher at (5,3) — I'll be adjacent at (4,3).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, isolating myself. Current position (3,5). Allies are at (4,4) and (5,3). Valid moves include (1,5) and (5,5) which are edge tiles. Moving to (5,5) would put me near Shade at (4,4), so (1,5) is better for isolation — far from both allies and enemies. From (1,5) I can move again to reach further isolation.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is at (4,4) and Watcher at (5,3), both in range. There's already a trap at (3,4). Shade is healthy and adjacent to my ally Wraith at (4,3) - dangerous. I can't use trap since I'm adjacent to... wait, checking Denial passive - I'm Vector, not adjacent to enemy Vector, so trap should work. Place a trap at (4,4) where Shade currently stands or at (5,4) to cut off movement. Actually Shade is AT (4,4) so I can't place a trap on an occupied tile. Watcher is wounded - pulse would hit Shade at dist 1 if I move to (4,3)... but Wraith is there. Move to (3,2) puts me away from enemies. Better: place trap at (5,4) to intercept Shade/Watcher movement, or attack Watcher directly. Watcher is wounded - attack range is adjacent only so can't reach. Trap at (4,4) blocked by Shade. Try placing trap at (5,4) to deny escape routes, then consider pulse - but only 1 enemy would be adjacent from current position. Shade is at dist 2 (not adjacent). Best: place trap at (4,4)... occupied. Place trap at (5,4) to cut off Watcher/Shade retreat, then wait or reposition.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Shade 4/4, Watcher 6/10, Grid 5/7, Wraith 2/4 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 4 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent (1 tile) so scan is blocked by... wait, scan is blocked by Vector adjacency, not specter. Grid(vector) is at (4,2), 2 tiles away — not adjacent, so scan is NOT blocked. Wraith is wounded and adjacent at (4,3). I already know both enemy prompts. Priority: Wraith is wounded and adjacent — dangerous. I should move away to avoid being hit again. Move to (5,4) to create distance from Wraith, then scan... but I already know both enemy prompts. Recalibrate could help Shade or Aegis. Shade is at (4,4) which is adjacent to (5,4) if I move there. Actually Shade is healthy. Let me think about attack — Wraith is adjacent and wounded, attack does 1dmg. Or I could move away first. Foresight shows Wraith used shadow_strike on (5,3) last turn — that's my position, so I took damage. Wraith is wounded, one more hit could finish it. I'm at 6/10 HP. Move to (5,4) to stay near but slightly repositioned, then attack Wraith at (4,3) — wait, after moving to (5,4), Wraith at (4,3) is distance sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent. Adjacent means distance=1. From (5,4) to (4,3) is diagonal, not adjacent for attack. Stay at (5,3) and attack Wraith at (4,3) — it's 1 tile away. But Grid at (4,2) is 2 tiles — not adjacent, so no scan block. Attack Wraith first (it's wounded, might finish it), then move away to (5,4) to avoid retaliation.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - extremely vulnerable. Shade is adjacent at (4,4). Watcher is wounded at (5,4) and I'm already behind them. I need to eliminate the wounded Watcher for the kill. Move to (5,3) which puts me behind Watcher and adjacent, then shadow_strike Watcher for 1dmg to finish them off. This avoids Shade's attack and picks up a kill. Note: (3,4) has a trap, so avoid it.
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at critical HP and I'm behind it from (4,3). Move to (4,3) — that tile is behind both Grid and Wraith. Then shadow_strike Wraith at (5,3) to finish it off while staying cloaked. Avoid moving adjacent to Grid (at 4,2) since that would block abilities.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(0,5) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, isolating myself. My allies are Shade at (4,3) and Watcher at (5,4). I'm at (1,5). Moving toward (0,5) and then (0,4) gets me to the western edge, away from allies. Valid moves include (0,5) and (0,4). I'll move to (0,5) first, then (0,4) to push to the corner edge.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(4,2) ✓ → move(3,1) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (4,3) - prime pulse target. I'm already on a trap at (4,2). Pulse hits Shade for 1dmg. Then move away to safety since I'm wounded and Shade is right on top of me. Move to (3,1) to reposition and place traps on likely enemy paths next turn.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Shade 3/4, Watcher 5/10, Grid 5/7 | Dead: Bolt, Wraith

### Turn 5 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(5,3) ✗ No enemy at target
  💭 Grid is at distance 5, out of scan range (max 4). No enemies in range from current position. Foresight shows Grid used pulse at (4,2) last turn and moved to (3,1). I need to close distance to get Grid in scan range (≤4 tiles). Moving to (4,4) puts me at distance ~3.6 from Grid at (3,1) — within scan range. But I should check: from (4,4) to (3,1) = sqrt(1+9) = ~3.16, within 4. Actually wait, from (3,4) to (3,1) = dist 3, clearly in range. Move to (3,4) first, then scan Grid. But Grid has already been scanned. I should look for other enemies — Wraith is mentioned in Foresight (move to 5,3 then shadow_strike to 5,4) but not listed as a known enemy position. Wraith must be cloaked/specter enemy. From (5,4) I should try to scan Wraith. Foresight shows Wraith was at (5,3) or (5,4) area. Moving to (4,4) keeps distance. Actually Shade is ally. The enemy specter 'Wraith' must be cloaked. I should move toward where Wraith was seen and scan. From (5,4), move to (4,5) or stay — Wraith last seen around (5,3)-(5,4). If I move to (3,4), scan range covers (3,1) Grid. But Grid is already known. Better to try scanning Wraith who is cloaked enemy specter. Move to (4,5) to stay safe, then scan toward (5,3) where Wraith was seen.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,1) facing S, so the tile behind it is (3,2). I can move there in one move (dist=1 from current 4,3 to 3,2 is 2 tiles — valid). Then shadow_strike Grid from (3,2) which is adjacent. This keeps my cloak and deals 1 damage.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Shade is directly adjacent at (3,2) - that's a priority target. My Denial passive already blocks some of Shade's abilities. I can pulse to hit Shade for 1dmg, then move away to avoid retaliation. Alternatively, I could attack for 1dmg. Pulse hits all adjacent units for 1dmg - only Shade is adjacent so it's equivalent to attack but uses pulse slot. Let me use attack on Shade (adjacent, 1dmg), then move to (4,1) to place myself near the existing trap at (4,2) and set up a chokepoint. Wait - I should consider placing a trap on a likely enemy path. Watcher is at (3,4) moving south, Shade is at (3,2). If I move first to (2,1) I could trap (3,2) after Shade moves - but Shade is currently there. Better: attack Shade first, then move to (2,2) and trap a path tile. Actually Shade is adjacent so trap is blocked by Denial if Shade is enemy Vector - but Shade is a specter. My Denial blocks enemy abilities when adjacent to me, not my own trap. I can't place trap on occupied tile anyway. Best plan: attack Shade (1dmg), then move to (4,1) positioning near existing trap at (4,2) to funnel enemies.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,1), distance 7 — out of range and not threatening this turn. Allies Shade and Watcher are wounded at (3,2) and (3,4). I should advance toward the front to position between allies and the enemy. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer to both allies while maintaining a protective position. Then wait to preserve fortify for next turn if Grid approaches.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Shade 2/4, Watcher 4/10, Grid 4/7 | Dead: Bolt, Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,1) ✓
  💭 Grid is wounded and facing E, so moving to (3,1) puts me directly behind it. I can then use breach to take control — or shadow_strike for damage while staying safe. At 2HP I need to be careful. Moving to (3,1) is behind Grid and adjacent, so I can shadow_strike for 1dmg without breaking cloak. But I'm not currently cloaked, so shadow_strike won't help with stealth. Grid is wounded — a shadow_strike for 1dmg could finish it or weaken it further. Move to (3,1) behind Grid, then shadow_strike for 1dmg.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → recalibrate(3,1) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,1), distance 4 — exactly at scan range. I already have Grid's prompt, so scanning again wastes an action. Shade is wounded at (3,1). I should recalibrate Shade to buff them, but recalibrate requires adjacent range and Shade is at (3,1) — I'd need to move to (3,2) or (4,1) area to be adjacent. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Shade at (3,1) and lets me recalibrate. But (3,2) is also close to Grid at (4,1) — distance 2, not adjacent so no denial issue. Actually Grid denial blocks scan when adjacent, not movement. Move to (3,2) first, then recalibrate Shade at (3,1).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,1), distance 5, out of range. Allies Shade and Watcher are wounded at (3,1) and (3,2), south of me. I'm currently fortified at (2,4). Moving toward (3,3) keeps me between allies and the enemy Grid while staying close enough to shield_wall or intercept if Grid advances. Positioning at (3,3) puts me adjacent to both wounded allies and closer to Grid's approach path.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent (dist=1) and wounded - pulse would hit both Shade and Watcher if Watcher is within 1 tile of me. Watcher is at (3,2), I'm at (4,1) - that's distance 2, so not adjacent. But Shade at (3,1) is adjacent. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - Shade would take 1dmg. Watcher at (3,2) is not within 1 tile of (4,1). Only Shade is adjacent. Pulse for 1dmg on wounded Shade could finish or weaken them. Alternatively, direct attack on Shade (adjacent, 1dmg). I have a trap at (4,2) already. Aegis at (3,3) might move south toward (3,2) or (4,3). I should place a trap on a likely enemy path - (3,0) or (4,0) below current positions, or (4,3) where Aegis might advance. My Denial passive blocks Shade's cloak since she's adjacent. Attack Shade directly (1dmg, adjacent) then place trap at (4,3) to intercept Aegis movement.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Shade 1/4, Watcher 4/10, Grid 3/7 | Dead: Bolt, Wraith

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): attack(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,1) behind Grid who is at (4,1) facing E - I'm already in the behind position. I have 1HP so I need to finish this fight fast. Grid is wounded. I can't breach due to DENIAL zone, but basic attack still works. Shadow_strike works adjacent and keeps cloak if I have it, but I'm not cloaked. I'll just attack Grid directly - they're wounded so this might finish them. Attack does 1dmg from adjacent.
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(3,1) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is already scanned and wounded. Shade is critical at (3,1) and adjacent to Grid. I should recalibrate Shade to buff them since they're critical. I'm at (3,2), Shade is at (3,1) — that's adjacent, so recalibrate is valid. I can't scan Grid again (already scanned). Moving closer to Grid risks being adjacent to a Vector which blocks scan. Best play: recalibrate Shade to help them survive, and consider moving to maintain safe distance.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,1) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with full HP. Grid(vector) is 3 tiles away at (4,1), out of attack range. Shade is critical at (3,1) and Watcher is wounded at (2,2). I should position to protect allies while maintaining fortify if possible. Moving to (4,2) puts me between Grid and my wounded allies, closer to intercept if needed. But moving breaks fortify. Alternatively, I can hold position and use shield_wall toward S to protect Shade who is critical directly south of me at (3,1). Shield_wall toward S would protect Shade from attacks coming from the south/Grid's direction. Holding position preserves fortify bonus.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(3,1) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Shade is critical and adjacent at (3,1). I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. I can attack Shade to potentially finish them off. My Denial passive blocks their cloak ability while adjacent. After attacking, I should move to (4,2) where I have a trap - wait, (4,2) already has a trap. I'll attack Shade first (they're critical, 1dmg attack could finish them), then move to (5,1) to reposition slightly away from danger while staying in range to contest. Actually, Shade is critical so attack should eliminate or nearly eliminate them. Let me attack Shade then move to safety.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Watcher 4/10, Grid 2/7 | Dead: Shade, Bolt, Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → recalibrate(3,3) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,1), exactly 4 tiles away — within scan range. Grid is already scanned so no need to scan again. Grid is wounded and I'm at 4HP. I should stay at range and use scan if there were other targets, but Grid is the only enemy visible. I should recalibrate Aegis who is adjacent at (3,3) — wait, Aegis is at (3,3) and I'm at (2,2), that's distance 2 — not adjacent. I can move to (3,3) to be adjacent to Aegis... but that moves me closer to Grid. Or I can move to (2,3) or (3,2) to get adjacent to Aegis. (3,2) is 1 tile from (3,3) — adjacent. From (3,2) Grid at (5,1) is dist sqrt(4+1)=~2.2 tiles, still in range. But my orders say keep distance from enemies. Let me check: from (3,2), Grid is at distance |5-3|+|1-2|=3, so adjacent-free (Vector denial is adjacent=1). Safe. Recalibrate Aegis from (3,2) — Aegis is at (3,3), that's adjacent. Good plan: move to (3,2), recalibrate Aegis to buff them against Grid.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) E ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,1), distance 4, wounded and moving east. Watcher is wounded at (3,2). I need to position between Watcher and Grid. Moving to (4,2) closes distance while keeping me between ally and enemy. I'm fortified now but will lose it on move — acceptable trade for better positioning. Shield_wall toward S or E could protect Watcher. Moving to (4,2) puts me closer and I can shield_wall East toward Grid's approach vector.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,1) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with only 2HP - very low health. Aegis is adjacent at (4,2), distance 2. I need to be careful. My Denial passive blocks Aegis from using some abilities while adjacent. I can attack Aegis from range 2. I should either attack Aegis or place a trap. Since I'm low health, I want to stay back. I'll place a trap at (4,1) which is a tile Aegis might move through, then stay put or move to safer position. Actually, let me attack Aegis (dist=2, in range) for 1 damage, and place a trap on a likely movement tile. Trap at (4,1) would be good - between me and Aegis. But wait, I need to check if trap is blocked - trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not sentinel. Aegis is a sentinel, so trap should work. Place trap at (4,1) first, then attack Aegis at (4,2).
  State: Aegis 11/12, Watcher 4/10, Grid 2/7 | Dead: Shade, Bolt, Wraith

### Turn 9 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is wounded at (5,1), distance 3 — within scan range (≤4). Already scanned so prompt is known. Better to attack or recalibrate. Aegis is adjacent at (4,2) and wounded — recalibrate will buff them. Grid placed a trap at (4,1) last turn, so I should avoid that tile. I'm at (3,2), Aegis at (4,2). I'll recalibrate Aegis to help them fight Grid, then stay put or reposition. Recalibrate requires adjacent target — Aegis at (4,2) is adjacent to me at (3,2). I'll recalibrate Aegis first, then wait or reposition away from Grid's trap zone.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → attack(5,1) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,1), wounded, 2 tiles away. Trap at (4,1) — avoid it. I can move to (5,2) to get adjacent to Grid and attack. (5,2) is in my valid moves and not a trap tile. Moving there puts me adjacent to Grid at (5,1), then I can attack. I'm currently fortified but will lose that by moving — worth it to finish off a wounded enemy. Watcher ally is wounded at (3,2) and needs protection too, but Grid is the priority threat.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critical condition. Aegis is adjacent at (5,2). I need to survive. I can't place traps when adjacent to an enemy Vector (but I'm Vector, not the enemy). Wait - I'm Vector, so I check if enemy Vector is adjacent blocking my trap. No enemy Vector mentioned. Aegis is adjacent at (5,2) - my Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. I should use pulse to hit Aegis for 1 damage (they're adjacent), but I'm at 1HP so any hit kills me. Best play: move away to create distance, then consider options. Valid moves include (5,0), (4,0), (3,1). Moving to (3,1) gets distance from Aegis. Then I could place a trap at (4,1) which is already trapped, or (4,2) to block paths. Actually trap at (4,2) could catch Aegis moving. But priority is survival at 1HP. Move to (3,1) to escape Aegis, then place trap at (4,1) - wait that's already trapped. Place trap at (4,2) to block Aegis pursuit.
  State: Aegis 11/12, Watcher 4/10, Grid 1/7 | Dead: Shade, Bolt, Wraith
