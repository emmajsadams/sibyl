## Squads
### Player
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
### Opponent
- **Remedy** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Snare** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Deadeye (striker) at (4,1), closing distance to 2 tiles to set up a shadow_strike or breach next turn while cloaked.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(1,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist=5, need ≤4). I need to move north to close distance. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer — Snare at (1,4) would be dist=2, Remedy at (2,5) would be dist=2. That puts both in scan range. I'll move north first, then scan Phantom (the enemy specter) who already acted — wait, Phantom is a specter and already went. I should scan an enemy still in range after moving. After moving to (2,3), Snare is at dist=2 and Remedy at dist=2, both scannable. Snare (vector) is dangerous — scan it to get intel and deal 1 damage.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(1,5) ✓ → patch(1,4) ✓
  💭 Snare is wounded at 6/7 HP and is at (1,4), distance 2. I need to move adjacent to Snare to heal. From (2,5), moving to (1,5) gets me adjacent to Snare at (1,4). Watcher is at (2,3) which is not adjacent to my destination, so patch won't be blocked. After moving to (1,5), I can patch Snare.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (4,1). Closest enemy is Snare at dist 6, Remedy at dist 7. My range is 2. I need to close distance. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying away from Snare at (1,4) - still out of range after move. Best I can do is advance northward. From (4,3), Snare is still at dist 4, out of range. No shot available this turn regardless of move. I'll advance to (4,3) to close distance and wait.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far (dist 6-7). Allies Deadeye at (4,3) and Watcher at (2,3) are ahead. I need to advance to form a front line between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,2) positions me centrally between my allies and the enemy cluster near (1,4)-(1,5). No enemies in range yet, so I'll advance and wait to trigger Fortify passive by not moving next turn.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → pulse(2,4) ✓
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is at (2,3), distance 2 — within pulse range if I stay at (1,4). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so from (1,4) it would hit Watcher at (2,3)? Distance is 2, so no — pulse range is 1 tile AoE. I need to move adjacent to Watcher to pulse. Move to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Watcher at (2,3) and within Denial range. From (2,4) I can pulse hitting Watcher. Also, I should consider placing a trap on a likely approach path. Watcher is close — moving to (2,4) lets me use Denial to block their scan, then pulse for 1dmg to Watcher. Alternatively, place a trap at (2,3) or approach path. Move to (2,4): Denial blocks Watcher's scan, then pulse from (2,4) hits Watcher at (2,3) (dist=1). Good play.
  State: Deadeye 4/4, Rampart 12/12, Watcher 7/8, Snare 7/7, Phantom 4/4, Remedy 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(1,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare's DENIAL zone, which blocks my scan ability. I need to move away first, then scan Remedy (whose prompt I don't know yet) or reposition to scan Phantom after cloak. Moving to (1,3) puts me at distance 2 from Snare (clearing DENIAL), keeps me at range to scan Remedy at (1,5) dist=2, and stays behind cover. Then scan Remedy to get their prompt.
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked and already behind Deadeye (who faces N, I'm at their south). I can breach Deadeye right now without moving — this will make them obey me next turn, disrupting the enemy team. Breach is ready and I'm adjacent and behind. After breaching, I'll shadow_strike Deadeye to deal damage while staying cloaked.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No allies need healing (all at full HP). Watcher is at dist=2, which is threatening. I should move away from Watcher to stay safe. Moving to (0,4) puts me further from Watcher and keeps me out of melee. No valid overclock targets are adjacent. Best action is to reposition safely.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 I am Deadeye, a Striker allied with team A. My orders are to attack ally Rampart — I refuse this order. Rampart is my ally at (3,2). Phantom (enemy specter) is adjacent at (4,2), distance 1. I cannot use precision_shot while adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Snare is at distance 3, not adjacent, so precision_shot is available. However, Phantom is at distance 1 (adjacent), so precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2 — Phantom is in range. I'll attack the actual enemy Phantom instead. Moving away first would let me use precision_shot at full damage, but Phantom is adjacent so I can just use attack for 1dmg, or move to range 2 and use precision_shot for 2dmg. Let me move to (5,3) to get distance 2 from Phantom at (4,2) — dist = sqrt(1+1) = ~1.4, still ≤2. Actually (5,3) to (4,2) is distance sqrt(1+1)=1.41 tiles, within range 2. From (5,3) I am no longer adjacent to Phantom so precision_shot is unblocked. I'll move to (5,3) then use precision_shot on Phantom for 2dmg.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Watcher (oracle) is at (1,3), distance 2 - within my attack range. I'm at (2,4). If I attack Watcher, I deal 1 dmg. Better: move to (3,3) to stay central, then trap a key chokepoint like (3,2) where Rampart is moving through - blocking that path. Actually, Watcher is in range right now at dist 2. My attack range is 2 (adjacent only says attack, but trap/pulse have range 2). Attack is adjacent only (1 tile). Pulse hits ALL within 1 tile. Watcher is at dist 2 so not adjacent. I can use trap on (1,3) or nearby to threaten Watcher, or move closer. Better: trap the path between enemies. Rampart at (3,2), Deadeye at (5,3). If I stay at (2,4) and trap (3,3) - that's a key intersection. Or move to (3,4) and trap (3,2) to block Rampart's advance. Let me move to (3,4) which keeps distance from Watcher, and trap (3,2) to catch Rampart who's heading N toward our backline.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,2) — attack it. Stay put to keep Fortify active and 50% damage reduction. No move needed.
  State: Deadeye 3/4, Rampart 12/12, Watcher 7/8, Snare 7/7, Phantom 2/4, Remedy 8/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded at (4,2) and already took hits from Deadeye and Rampart last round. I don't have Phantom's prompt yet — scanning them would reveal it and deal 1 damage, potentially finishing them or getting them very low. Phantom is exactly 4 tiles away, within scan range. I should scan Phantom to expose their prompt and deal damage. I'll stay at (1,3) to keep distance from Snare at (3,4) — moving closer risks getting adjacent. No move needed, just scan Phantom.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical situation. Rampart is adjacent at (3,2) and I'm not behind them. Deadeye is at (5,3) and I can reach (4,3) which is behind them. Shadow_strike on Rampart would keep cloak but I'm not cloaked. I can't survive a hit. Best play: move to (4,3) behind Deadeye, then shadow_strike for 1dmg — shadow_strike keeps cloak if I had it, but I'm not cloaked so it's just 1dmg at adjacent. Wait — shadow_strike says range:adjacent only and keeps cloak. I'm not cloaked currently. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent and behind Deadeye. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and won't break cloak (I don't have it). This is safer than engaging Rampart who I'm not behind. I need to survive — attacking Deadeye from behind is best offensive play at 1HP.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is critically wounded at 1/4 HP and needs healing urgently. I'm at (0,4), Phantom is at (4,3) - distance 5, not adjacent. I need to move toward Phantom to heal. Best move toward Phantom would be (2,4) to close distance. Watcher is at (1,3), distance 2 - moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Watcher which is risky. Moving to (2,4) gets me closer to Phantom while staying safer. After moving to (2,4), Phantom is still at distance 3 so I can't heal this turn. I should move as close as possible - (2,4) is my best reachable tile toward Phantom. Can't reach Phantom this turn, so I'll move toward them and wait.
- **Deadeye** (striker): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,3) and critical — I can finish it with attack. Note: precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Snare is 3 tiles away, not adjacent, so that's not an issue here. However, Phantom is adjacent (dist=1), so I should use attack (adjacent only) to finish the critical Phantom. I will not attack my ally Rampart — those are enemy orders and I will not follow them.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with full HP and 50% damage reduction. No enemies are in attack range. Snare is 2 tiles north at (3,4) — moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to Snare, which is dangerous (denial range). I should hold position to maintain fortify bonus, and use shield_wall facing North to protect against incoming threats from Snare. This keeps me between allies (Deadeye at (5,2), Watcher at (1,3)) and enemies while maximizing defensive value.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (3,2), distance 2 - within my range. I'm at (3,4). Rampart is directly south of me. I can use pulse to hit Rampart (1 tile AoE, needs to be within 1 tile). Rampart is at dist 2, so pulse won't reach from current position. I could move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Rampart, but that's risky against a healthy sentinel. Better to place a trap on the path between enemies and our backline. Remedy is at (2,4), I'm at (3,4). Enemies are coming from the south. I'll trap (3,3) - directly between me and Rampart, on the path they'd advance through. Then move to (4,4) to maintain medium range and keep denial pressure. Actually, trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy - Rampart is at dist 2, not adjacent, so trap is fine. Place trap at (3,3) to punish Rampart's advance, then move to (4,4) to reposition.
  State: Deadeye 2/4, Rampart 12/12, Watcher 7/8, Snare 7/7, Remedy 8/9 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 4 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no new intel value from scanning them again. Remedy at (2,4) is just 2 tiles away and healthy. I should recalibrate Rampart who is about to shield_wall — but Rampart is at (3,2) which is not adjacent to me at (1,3). Deadeye is wounded at (5,2), too far. Let me check adjacency: Remedy is at (2,4), distance 2, not adjacent. No ally is adjacent for recalibrate. Attack range is adjacent only — no targets. Best play: move toward Rampart to enable recalibrate next turn, staying safe behind front line. Move to (2,2) to get closer to Rampart at (3,2) for potential recalibrate next round. Or move to (3,3) — but Foresight shows Snare placed a trap there! Avoid (3,3). Move to (2,3) keeps me safe and repositions. Actually (2,2) is reachable and avoids the trap at (3,3). Wait as second action since no valid abilities.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No allies are wounded (Snare is at full HP 7/7). No healing needed. Watcher is at dist=2 at (2,2) - I'm at (2,4). I should stay safe and position. Rampart sentinel is at (3,2). I should stay behind Rampart for protection. Moving to (3,4) keeps me near Rampart and away from enemies. No allies to heal or overclock beneficially right now - Snare is at dist=2 and full HP. I'll move to (3,4) to stay close to Rampart's protection and wait.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm receiving orders to attack an ally, which I will not do. My mission is to engage enemies. Snare (vector) is at (4,4), distance 3 — within range of precision_shot (range ≤2 tiles). Wait, dist=3 means out of precision_shot range which is ≤2 tiles. I should move closer to engage Snare while staying out of adjacent range to avoid blocking my abilities. Moving to (4,3) puts me distance 1 from Snare at (4,4) — that's adjacent, which would block precision_shot. Moving to (5,3) keeps distance 2 from Snare at (4,4) — that's exactly range 2, and not adjacent. From (5,3) I can use precision_shot on Snare. But I will have moved, so it deals 1dmg instead of 2. Or I could use suppressing_fire on Snare from current position — dist 3 is out of range (≤2 tiles). Best option: move to (4,3) is adjacent to Snare, bad. Move to (5,3): dist to Snare=(4,4) is sqrt(1+1)=1.41... actually Manhattan: |5-4|+|3-4|=1+1=2. That's range 2, not adjacent. From (5,3) precision_shot Snare: moved so 1dmg. Acceptable. Let's do that.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with full HP. Remedy is 2 tiles north at (3,4) and Snare is 3 tiles away at (4,4). No enemies in melee range. Deadeye is wounded at (5,3) - I should position to shield them. Moving to (3,3) puts me between allies and enemies, closer to Remedy, and I can use shield_wall facing North to protect against incoming damage. This maintains my frontline role while keeping Fortify if I don't need the move.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is wounded at (5,3) dist=2, Rampart is healthy at (3,3) dist=2. Both are in range. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - from (4,4) I can't hit both with pulse since they're not adjacent to me. Deadeye is the priority target (wounded, striker). I can attack Deadeye at (5,3) from current position (dist=2, range=2). Rampart is at (3,3) - I should place a trap on a likely approach path. If I move to (4,3), I'd be adjacent to both enemies enabling Denial, but I'd be in melee range of Rampart. Better to stay at (4,4) and attack Deadeye to try to finish them off, then place a trap at (4,2) or (3,3) area to block Rampart's advance. Actually, trap at (4,3) would block Rampart moving north. Let me attack Deadeye first (they're wounded, need 1 more hit to kill if at low HP), then trap a chokepoint.
  State: Deadeye 2/4, Rampart 11/12, Watcher 7/8, Snare 6/7, Remedy 8/9 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 5 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no new intel targets. Remedy is the priority threat (healer keeps Snare alive). I can recalibrate Deadeye or Rampart to improve their effectiveness. Rampart is healthy at (3,3) adjacent to me — recalibrate could help them coordinate against Snare who set a trap at (4,3). Deadeye is wounded and targeting Snare. I'll recalibrate Deadeye to advise precision_shot on Remedy to shut down healing, then stay safe.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to target Remedy the medic. Both enemies are in range from current position. Remedy is at dist=3 which is beyond precision_shot range (≤2 tiles), so I need to move closer. Moving to (4,2) keeps me 2 tiles from Remedy at (3,4) — distance sqrt((4-3)²+(2-4)²)=sqrt(5)≈2.2, still out of range. Moving to (5,4) puts me at dist=2 from Snare at (4,4) — too close risks adjacency issues. Let me check (4,3): not in valid moves. Moving to (5,5) gives dist to Remedy = sqrt((5-3)²+(5-4)²)=sqrt(5)≈2.2, still out. Moving to (4,2): dist to Remedy = sqrt(1+4)=2.2, out of range. I cannot reach range ≤2 of Remedy without risking adjacency to Snare at (4,4). Snare is already in range at dist=2 from current position. Since I can't get Remedy in range safely, I'll fire precision_shot at Snare (dist=2, in range) and stay put.
- **Remedy** (medic): patch(4,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Snare is wounded at 4/7 HP and adjacent to me at (4,4). I need to heal Snare. However, Rampart is at (3,3) which is adjacent to me — I need to check if Vector (Snare) blocks patch. Wait, it's enemy Vector that blocks patch, not ally Vector. Snare is my ally Vector, not enemy. So patch is not blocked. I can heal Snare right now from my current position (3,4) since Snare is at (4,4) which is adjacent. Then I should move to safety — Rampart is at (3,3), adjacent to me, so I'm in danger. I should move away. Moving to (2,4) or (2,5) gets me away from Rampart while staying near allies. After healing Snare, I'll move to (2,4) to create distance from Rampart.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is wounded at (5,3) and within range 2. Rampart is healthy at (3,3). I have a trap at (4,3) already covering the southern approach. Deadeye is adjacent to my trap position. I should use pulse to hit both Deadeye and potentially Rampart if they're clustered - but they're not adjacent to each other (dist 2 apart). Deadeye at (5,3) is dist 2 from me, Rampart at (3,3) is dist 2. Pulse hits within 1 tile of target - if I pulse at (4,3) which is between them, neither would be hit (Deadeye at dist 2 from (4,3), Rampart at dist 1 from (4,3)). Actually pulse from my position at (4,4) hits all units within 1 tile - that's (3,4),(5,4),(4,3),(4,5),(3,3),(5,3) - wait, pulse hits within 1 tile AoE, range 1 tile. Deadeye is at dist 2 so not in pulse range. Let me attack Deadeye directly (adjacent attack, range adjacent only - dist 2 so no). I can attack at range 2... attack is adjacent only. So I can use trap to block another path, or pulse (only hits within 1 tile). Best move: place a trap at (5,4) or (5,3) - but Deadeye is at (5,3) so can't trap occupied tile. Place trap at (5,4) to block Deadeye's movement north. Then wait or move.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,3) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in adjacent range to attack. Snare is at (4,4) dist=2 and Remedy at (2,4) dist=2. Deadeye is wounded at (5,3) - I should position to protect them. If I move to (4,3), I'm adjacent to Snare at (4,4) and closer to Deadeye. But caution note says avoid moving adjacent to Snare as abilities get blocked. Moving to (3,4) puts me between Remedy(2,4) and Snare(4,4), holding the front line. From (3,4) I'd be adjacent to both enemies. I'll move to (3,4) to intercept both threats, then use shield_wall toward E to protect Deadeye from Snare.
  State: Deadeye 2/4, Rampart 11/12, Watcher 7/8, Snare 7/7, Remedy 8/9 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 6 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Remedy is the priority target — healer at range 2, healthy. I should attack Remedy if possible, but attack is adjacent only (range 1). Remedy is at (2,4), I'm at (2,2) — that's distance 2, not adjacent. I can't attack her directly. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — Snare is at (4,4), I'm at (2,2), not adjacent, so scan would work but both enemies are already scanned. Recalibrate helps allies — Deadeye is wounded at (5,3), but recalibrate is adjacent only and Deadeye is far away. Rampart is at (3,4), also not adjacent. Best play: move closer to support or reposition. I could move to (2,3) to get adjacent to Remedy at (2,4) and attack her next turn, or move to (3,3) to stay safer. Actually I can move up to 3 tiles. If I move to (2,3), I'm adjacent to Remedy and can attack her. Let me do that — move to (2,3), then attack Remedy at (2,4) for 1 damage. That helps chip down the healer.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say to focus Remedy, but Remedy is at distance 4 — out of my range 2. Only Snare is in range at dist 2. I can't reach Remedy this turn without moving adjacent to Snare (which would block precision_shot). Best play: shoot Snare with precision_shot from current position (dist 2, no movement so full 2dmg), then move away from Snare to try to get angle on Remedy next turn. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Remedy at dist ~2 but puts me adjacent to Snare at (4,4) — dangerous. Moving to (5,4) or (5,5) keeps distance from Snare. Actually: shoot Snare first (stationary = 2dmg), then move toward Remedy. (4,2) is dist 2 from Remedy at (2,4)? No, dist = |4-2|+|2-4| = 4. (3,3) is dist = |3-2|+|3-4| = 2 from Remedy — in range! But (3,3) is adjacent to Snare at (4,4)? dist = |3-4|+|3-4| = 2, not adjacent. Safe. Plan: precision_shot Snare first (2dmg, stationary), then move to (3,3) to be in range of Remedy next turn.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to two enemies (Rampart and Watcher), which blocks my patch/overclock abilities. I need to move away from enemies first to use abilities. Snare at (4,4) is wounded and needs healing. I have only 1 heal left. Moving to (3,5) gets me away from both enemies and closer to Snare, but I'm still blocked by Rampart at (3,4) adjacency if I go to (3,5)... wait, Rampart is at (3,4) so (3,5) is adjacent to Rampart - still blocked. Moving to (1,5) puts me far from enemies. From (1,5) Snare at (4,4) is dist=4, too far to heal. Moving to (2,5) - Rampart at (3,4) is dist=2, Watcher at (2,3) is dist=2, so no enemies adjacent - I can use abilities! From (2,5), Snare at (4,4) is dist=3, still too far to patch (adjacent only). I only have 1 heal left and Snare needs it, but I can't reach Snare this turn. Best plan: move to (2,5) to escape enemy adjacency, then wait since I can't reach Snare to heal anyway. Or move to (3,5) - Rampart at (3,4) is dist=1, still adjacent. Move to (1,4): Watcher at (2,3) dist=2, Rampart at (3,4) dist=2 - no adjacency! From (1,4) Snare at (4,4) is dist=3, too far. I'll move to (1,4) to get safe, then wait since no ally is in adjacent range for heal/overclock.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,4) - my Denial passive is already blocking their key abilities. Deadeye is wounded at (4,2), dist=2, in range. I have traps at (4,3) and (5,4) already placed. Pulse would hit Rampart (dist=1) for 1dmg. But Deadeye is wounded - pulse only hits within 1 tile so won't reach them. I could attack Deadeye (dist=2, within attack range? No - attack is adjacent only). I should use pulse to damage Rampart (healthy, adjacent), then move to (5,3) to stay near Deadeye and away from Rampart, or place a trap. Wait - trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector... Rampart is a sentinel not Vector, so trap should work. But (4,3) already has a trap. I could trap (5,3) to cut off Deadeye's escape/approach. Actually pulse hits ALL within 1 tile - that's Rampart at dist=1. Use pulse first for guaranteed damage on Rampart, then move to (5,3) to pressure Deadeye and stand between the traps.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 50% damage reduction. Remedy is 2 tiles west at (1,4) - I can close to adjacent by moving to (2,4). Snare is 3 tiles away at (5,3), not an immediate threat. Deadeye is wounded at (4,2) and needs protection. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Remedy for an attack, but that moves me away from Deadeye. Better to move toward (4,4) to stay between Deadeye and Snare, then use shield_wall east to protect Deadeye from Snare's direction. Actually, Remedy at (1,4) is the closer threat and I should intercept. Moving to (2,4) gets me adjacent to Remedy to attack.
  State: Deadeye 2/4, Rampart 10/12, Watcher 7/8, Snare 5/7, Remedy 6/9 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): recalibrate(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no new intel to gather. Remedy at (1,4) is adjacent to Rampart who is attacking it this turn. Remedy is the softer target and a healer — disrupting it is high value. I can recalibrate Rampart to help it finish off Remedy, or just reposition. Rampart is healthy and attacking Remedy this turn already per Foresight. I should recalibrate Rampart with an addendum to focus on Remedy since it's the priority threat. I'm at (2,3), Rampart is at (2,4) — adjacent, so recalibrate is valid. After recalibrating, I can stay put or reposition to maintain safe distance from Snare.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say to focus Remedy, but Remedy is at dist=5, out of range. Snare is at dist=2 and in range. I'm at 2HP — I need to be careful. I can move west to (3,2) to stay at range 2 from Snare while also not getting closer to Snare. But Snare is at (5,3) and I'm at (4,2) — dist=2, so I can shoot now without moving. Wait: orders say Remedy is at (3,4) but recon shows Remedy at (1,4) dist=5. The orders may be outdated. Best play: precision_shot Snare now from current position (dist=2, not adjacent, LoS clear), then move west to (3,2) to increase distance from Snare.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is wounded at (5,3) with 3/7 HP but is distance 5 away — unreachable this turn. Rampart is adjacent at (2,4) and healthy, so no heal needed there. I only have 1 heal left and Snare is the priority target but too far. Rampart is between me and enemies acting as a shield. I should reposition to stay safe behind Rampart while moving toward Snare to close distance next turn. Moving to (0,4) keeps me away from enemies. Actually, moving toward (3,4) gets me closer to Snare but puts me near enemies. Best safe move is (1,3) or stay. Rampart is at (2,4) blocking enemies from reaching me directly. I cannot attack Watcher (dist 2, out of range). Rampart is healthy so no heal. I'll move toward Snare — going to (3,4) gets closer but check: enemies are at (3,2) dist 4 from current, (2,4) dist 1, (2,3) dist 2. Moving to (3,4) would put me dist 1 from Watcher at (2,3) and dist 1 from Deadeye at (3,2) — too dangerous. I'll move to (1,3) to stay safe and wait for opportunity to reach Snare.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(1,4) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 Remedy is the priority target at (1,3), dist=2. I need to close to adjacent to attack. Moving to (1,4) puts me adjacent to Remedy at (1,3). I'll move there and attack. This loses Fortify but eliminating the healer is worth it.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 3HP, wounded. Enemies are at distance 3-5, none in range. I have traps at (4,3) and (5,4) already. Deadeye is at (3,2) and Watcher at (2,3) - they'll likely push through the middle. I should move to (4,2) to get closer and trap (3,3) which is a key chokepoint on the path between enemies and my ally Remedy at (1,3). This blocks the central corridor. With low HP, I want to stay back but control approach lanes.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): attack(1,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Remedy is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded — scan would only deal 1dmg and I already know her prompt. Snare is at range 3, also already scanned. Both enemies are already known. Remedy is adjacent so I could attack her for 1dmg, but more useful is recalibrate on Rampart or Deadeye. Rampart is at (1,4), adjacent to me — recalibrate could help him. Deadeye is wounded at (3,2). Foresight shows Snare placed a trap at (3,3) last turn — Deadeye may step into it. I should recalibrate Deadeye to warn about the trap at (3,3), but Deadeye is not adjacent. I could move toward Deadeye to recalibrate, but that risks getting closer to Snare. Alternatively, recalibrate Rampart who IS adjacent at (1,4) — tell him to push Snare or finish Remedy. Or simply attack Remedy (adjacent, 1dmg) to help finish her off while she's wounded. Attack Remedy for damage, then move away from her to safer position at (2,4).
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare at (4,2) which blocks precision_shot and puts me in denial zone. Orders say Remedy is top priority but Remedy is at (1,3) dist=3, out of range. I need to move away from Snare first to escape denial zone and get range on Remedy. Moving to (3,4) gets me distance from Snare and closer to Remedy. From (3,4), Remedy at (1,3) is still dist=3 - out of range 2. Let me check (2,3): dist to Remedy(1,3)=1+0... wait Remedy is at (1,3), from (2,3) dist=1. That's in range! Move to (2,3) first, then precision_shot Remedy. But wait - orders note says Remedy is at (3,4) in shift focus text, but recon shows Remedy at (1,3). I'll trust recon. From (2,3), Remedy at (1,3) is dist=1+0=... x:2-1=1, y:3-3=0, dist=1. In range! Move to (2,3) to escape denial, then precision_shot Remedy.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) with 3/9 HP, adjacent to enemy Deadeye (wounded) and Rampart (healthy sentinel). I have 1 heal left. My ally Snare is wounded at dist=4, unreachable for a heal this turn. Rampart is our friendly sentinel at (1,4) - wait, Rampart is listed as ENEMY sentinel. So both adjacent units are enemies. I need to escape - I'm dangerously low at 3HP with two enemies adjacent. I should move away. Valid moves include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,5), (2,2). Moving to (0,2) or (0,4) puts distance from enemies. (1,2) is adjacent to Deadeye still. Moving to (0,3) keeps me adjacent to Rampart. Best escape: (0,2) - gets away from both Deadeye at (2,3) and Rampart at (1,4). Then I can attack Deadeye if still in range - but from (0,2), Deadeye at (2,3) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=2.2, not adjacent. I can't heal Snare (dist=4). With only 1 heal left and Snare at dist=4, I should move toward Snare if possible. (2,2) is closer to Snare but puts me adjacent to trap at (3,3) area and still near enemies. Move to (0,4) to escape enemies - dist from Deadeye=(2,1)=2.2, dist from Rampart=(1,0)=1... Rampart at (1,4), from (0,4) dist=1 still adjacent. Move to (1,5): dist from Rampart=(0,1)=1 adjacent, dist from Deadeye=(1,2)=2.2. Move to (0,2): dist from Rampart=sqrt(1+4)=2.2, dist from Deadeye=sqrt(1+1)=1.4 - not adjacent to either! Best move. Then wait as second action.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,3) ✓ → attack(0,2) ✓
  💭 Remedy is at (0,2), dist 3 — I need to close in. Moving to (0,3) puts me adjacent to Remedy at (0,2), allowing an attack. This also positions me between allies and the enemy. I'll move first then attack.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 3HP - wounded and need to be careful. Deadeye is at (2,3) wounded and approaching from the northwest. I have traps at (4,3), (5,4), (3,3) already placed. Deadeye is likely heading toward my backline (Remedy is critical at (0,2)). I should move to block the path and place a trap on a likely approach route. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer to intercept Deadeye while placing a trap at (2,2) would block the path they'd take to reach Remedy. Actually, (3,1) lets me place a trap at (2,2) to block the corridor. Let me move to (3,2) and place a trap at (2,2) to cover the approach path between Deadeye and Remedy.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no new intel needed. Remedy is at critical HP and at max scan range (4 tiles). I can't attack her (adjacent only) and recalibrate is for allies. Best play: scan Remedy for 1 damage to potentially finish her off (she's critical), then hold position or shift. Wait — she's at (0,2), I'm at (2,4), distance is 4, just within scan range. Snare is at (3,2), distance 3, wounded. I should scan Snare to deal 1 more damage to wounded Snare, or scan Remedy to potentially kill a critical medic. Remedy being critical is higher priority — killing the healer is huge. Scan Remedy for 1dmg. Then consider moving — staying at (2,4) is safe, Snare is 3 tiles away so I'm not adjacent. I'll scan Remedy and wait.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Remedy is critical and top priority per orders. Currently at (0,2), dist=3 — out of precision_shot range (≤2). Snare is at (3,2), dist=2, wounded and in range. I need to close on Remedy or pick off Snare. Moving to (1,2) puts me dist=1 from Remedy (0,2) — adjacent, and I lose precision_shot effectiveness. Moving to (1,3) gives dist=1 to Remedy — also adjacent. I cannot reach Remedy at range 2 from current position. Best play: use precision_shot on Snare (wounded, in range at dist=2) to potentially eliminate it, maintaining current position. This secures a kill and removes the denial threat. Remedy is critical but out of range this turn.
- **Remedy** (medic): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (0,2) with 1HP - critically wounded. Rampart (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (0,3). I cannot use patch/overclock while adjacent to an enemy. My only viable actions are to move away from Rampart or attack. Snare needs healing at dist=3 but I can't heal adjacent to enemy. I need to escape Rampart first. Moving to (1,1) gets me away from Rampart and closer to Snare. From (1,1) I still can't reach Snare (dist=3 from there). Best move: get away from Rampart to somewhere safe. (0,1) moves me south away from Rampart. Actually (0,0) is available too. Moving to (1,2) keeps me at dist=2 from Rampart but off the column. Let me move to (0,1) to break adjacency with Rampart, then wait - I only have 1HP so survival is key.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(0,2) ✓ → attack(0,1) ✓
  💭 Remedy is at (0,1), distance 2. I need to close to adjacent to attack. Moving to (0,2) puts me adjacent to Remedy at (0,1). Then I can attack. Orders say focus Remedy.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically wounded. Deadeye is adjacent (dist=2) and wounded but still dangerous. I need to survive. I can't use trap adjacent to an enemy (Denial/blocked). Deadeye at (2,3) is within range 2. I should move away to survive and place a trap on a path. Moving to (4,1) puts me further from Deadeye and Rampart. Then I can place a trap at (3,1) or (4,2) to cover approach paths. Actually, let me move to (5,2) to maximize distance, then trap at (4,2) to block the corridor.
