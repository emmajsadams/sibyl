## Squads
### Player
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then move north toward Ghost at (1,4) to close distance while invisible. Ghost is the closest enemy at dist 4, facing S. I'll move to (1,3) to get within striking range next turn.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders. Then advance toward enemies. Snare is closer at dist 5, moving south toward us. I'll cloak first, then move toward (1,2) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range. I need to advance to get Snare within scan range (dist 5, need ≤4). Moving south toward center will close distance. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to Snare at (3,1) — dist would be ~2, well within scan range. Let me move to (2,2) first, then scan Snare.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Lens (oracle) at dist 4 is closest. Need to close distance but stay at max range (2 tiles). Moving to (4,2) brings me to dist 3 from Lens at (2,2) - still out of range. Moving to (4,2) is the best I can do with mv2. After moving to (4,2), Lens at (2,2) would be at dist 2+0=2 tiles - let me check: |4-2|+|2-2|=2, so exactly in range! Precision shot Lens.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Lens (oracle) is at dist 2, within my range. I should move closer to deny Lens abilities via my Denial passive. Moving to (2,2) would be on top of Lens — instead move to (3,2) to get adjacent to Lens and deny their abilities. Then place a trap between Bastion and our position to control the chokepoint at (3,3).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Push forward to (3,3) to close distance with Snare at (3,2). This gets me adjacent to Snare next turn for attack. Avoid moving to (3,2) directly since Snare is there. At (3,3) I'm 1 tile from Snare. Use shield_wall facing South to protect allies Ghost at (1,2) and Lens at (2,2) — wait, they're to my south, enemies are to my south too. Shield_wall N to block incoming from enemy direction. Actually enemies are at (3,2) which is N of (3,3). Shield_wall facing N to block damage coming from north.
  State: Shade 5/5, Snare 7/8, Deadeye 5/5, Ghost 5/5, Bastion 9/10, Lens 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. I'm already behind Lens at (2,2) — position (2,3) is behind them and reachable in 1 move. Move to (2,3) then breach Lens to waste their turn. This is high value: oracle disrupted early.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining — must use it this turn. Shade is behind me (west side) and I can reach position (1,3) which is behind Shade at (2,3) facing E. From (1,3) I'm adjacent to Shade and behind them, perfect for breach. Snare is a vector so I need to avoid adjacency to keep abilities working. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to Shade but NOT adjacent to Snare (which is at 3,2). I can breach Shade from (1,3) — that's the high-value play since Shade is the enemy specter and can threaten my allies.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,0) ✓ → scan(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone, blocking my scan ability. Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge. Allies are at (1,3) and (3,3), so I should move away from them. Deadeye targeted me with precision_shot last turn, so I need to reposition. Moving to (0,1) gets me to the south/west edge and away from allies. After moving, I'm out of denial range so I can scan Shade or Deadeye if in range, but from (0,1) they may be out of range. Let me move to (2,0) which is south edge, away from allies at (1,3) and (3,3), then possibly scan Deadeye at (4,2) dist=3 which is within scan range 4.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is the only enemy in range at dist=2. No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy unit in range. Bastion is a sentinel - not a medic, but it's my only target. I'll use precision_shot on Bastion. I'm not adjacent to any Vector (Snare is allied), so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg. Stay at current position to maintain range.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(3,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel) is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive is already blocking some of their abilities. I should pulse to damage Bastion (1dmg to all within 1 tile), which also hits any adjacent units. Then I can place a trap on a likely path - (3,4) or (4,3) to control approaches. Pulse first from current position hits Bastion. Then move to (4,3) or place trap at (3,4) to block northern approach.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and flanked by Shade to my west and Snare to my east. Snare's denial zone blocks my abilities except basic attack. I should attack Shade (healthy specter, high threat) since that's a basic attack and works through denial. I can't use shield_wall due to denial zone. Staying put keeps fortify active — but orders say push forward aggressively. However, I'm at 7/10 HP and surrounded. Best play: attack Shade to pressure the specter, then consider movement. Actually, if I move I lose fortify. I'll attack Shade first, then stay put to keep fortify reduction — the denial zone means shield_wall is blocked anyway, so fortify is my best defense here.
  State: Shade 4/5, Snare 7/8, Deadeye 3/5, Ghost 5/5, Bastion 7/10, Lens 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Shade (their facing is E, I'm at (1,3) which is behind them). Breach is on cooldown for 1 more turn, so I can't use it. Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best option: use shadow_strike on Shade for 1 damage while adjacent, then move away to avoid retaliation. Snare is 3 tiles away so I need to stay clear of adjacency to Snare.
- **Shade** (specter): move(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (2,3). Allies are at (4,3) and (4,2), so I should move away from the east side. The edge furthest from combat would be the west or north edge. Valid moves include (0,4), (0,2), (1,5) — moving toward the northwest corner gets me away from allies and combat. (1,5) is far from allies at (4,2)/(4,3) and away from the main fight. I'll move to (1,5) then wait.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge. Allies are at (0,3) and (3,3). I'm at (2,0) facing south. Edge tiles in my valid moves: (5,0) is furthest SE corner, maximizing distance from both allies. Move to (5,0) to reach the map edge. No enemies in scan range from current or destination position, so wait as second action.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(5,0) ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic. Lens is an oracle (likely the support/medic role). Both Bastion and Lens are in range from current position. Lens at (5,0) is dist 3, which exceeds my range of 2 for precision_shot. Bastion at (3,3) is dist 2, within range. I need to check if I can reach a position to hit Lens. Moving to (5,1) puts me at dist 1 from Lens (5,0) - that's adjacent, which I must avoid. Moving to (4,1) puts me dist 1 from Lens - also adjacent. Moving to (5,2) puts me at dist 2 from Lens (5,0) - that works and keeps me non-adjacent. From (5,2), Bastion at (3,3) is dist 3 - out of range. So I can either stay and hit Bastion, or move to (5,2) to hit Lens. Orders say target enemy medic (oracle=Lens) if no one wounded. Move to (5,2) then use precision_shot on Lens at (5,0). Check adjacency: (5,2) to (5,0) is dist 2 - not adjacent, safe. I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2, but orders prioritize the medic.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel) is adjacent at (3,3). My Denial passive already blocks some of its abilities. I can attack it for 1dmg, or use pulse to hit it. Pulse hits all within 1 tile - Bastion is at dist 1, so pulse would hit it. But attack also works. Deadeye is at (5,2) nearby - I should avoid hurting allies. Pulse from (4,3) would hit anything within 1 tile: (3,3)=Bastion, (5,3), (4,2), (4,4), (3,4), (5,4), (5,2)=Deadeye wounded ally - BAD. So no pulse. I'll attack Bastion instead. I should also place a trap to control approach routes. Ghost is at (0,3) heading our way. I can place a trap at (3,4) or (3,2) to catch movement. Let me attack Bastion first, then place a trap. Wait - trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but I'm a Vector. The warning says trap is blocked when adjacent to ENEMY Vector. Bastion is a sentinel not a vector, so trap should be fine. Place trap at (3,2) to block southern approach from Lens, or (3,4) to catch Ghost coming east. I'll attack Bastion and place trap at (2,3) to intercept Ghost's path.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare (vector) with DENIAL active, meaning only basic attack/movement work. Snare is healthy and at (4,3) — I can attack it directly. I'm fortified at 6HP. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. Snare is blocking my abilities so I should attack it to remove the denial zone. I'll attack Snare first, then consider moving. Since I'm fortified (didn't move last turn), attacking first preserves fortify status until I move.
  State: Shade 3/5, Snare 6/8, Deadeye 3/5, Ghost 5/5, Bastion 6/10, Lens 4/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,1) ✓ → scan(5,2) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. I'm at (5,0) facing E. Valid moves include (5,1) and (5,3) which keep me on the east edge. Deadeye is at (5,2) and foresight shows they'll precision_shot my current position (5,0) — moving away is doubly important. Moving to (5,3) puts me further from (5,0) target but toward Deadeye. Better to move to (4,0) or (3,0) to get away from allies clustered near center-left, while staying near edge. Actually allies are at (0,3) and (4,4) — moving south/east edge away from them. (5,1) keeps me east edge. I can scan Deadeye at dist 2 for 1 damage since they're wounded. Move to (5,1) first to dodge the precision_shot aimed at (5,0), then scan Deadeye at (5,2).
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (1,5) which is already near the top edge. I should move toward a corner or edge away from the action. Moving to (3,5) or (4,5) takes me along the top edge away from Ghost at (0,3) and away from my allies. I'll move to (4,5) to get to the far edge.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range. Snare is closest at dist 4. I need to close the gap. Moving to (3,3) gets me 1 tile closer to Snare at (4,3) — next turn I could reach adjacent. No abilities available this turn since no enemies in range.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(5,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent (dist=1), which means precision_shot is blocked if Lens is a Vector, but Lens is an oracle so no suppression issue. However, dist=1 means I'm adjacent to Lens. Precision_shot requires LoS and range ≤2, but the WARNING says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector - Lens is an oracle, not Vector, so precision_shot should work. But I'm at 2HP and adjacent to an enemy is risky. Orders say never move adjacent to enemies. I'm already adjacent to Lens at dist=1. I should move away while still keeping Lens in range. Moving to (5,4) gives dist=3 to Lens - out of range. Moving to (4,2) gives dist to Lens = |4-5|+|2-1|=2, still in range. Let me move to (4,2) first, then precision_shot Lens (dist=2, in range, no Vector adjacency issue). Actually moving first then shooting: from (4,2) Lens at (5,1) is dist=2, in range. But precision_shot does 1dmg if moved. Lens is healthy so 1dmg won't kill. Alternative: shoot first then move. Shoot Lens from current pos (dist=1, in range, no Vector adjacent) for 2dmg since not moved yet. Lens is healthy - unknown HP but 2dmg is good. Then move away to (4,2) or (5,4) to escape adjacency. Best plan: precision_shot Lens first (2dmg, full damage, no movement penalty), then move away.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,4) with 6HP. Shade is adjacent north at (4,5) wounded — priority target. Snare is adjacent south at (4,3) with DENIAL active blocking my abilities except basic attack. I should attack Shade (wounded, can finish) while staying fortified. If I move, I lose fortify bonus. Best play: attack Shade to eliminate the wounded specter, then shield_wall south facing Snare/Deadeye cluster. Wait — DENIAL from Snare blocks abilities. So I can only use basic attack or move. Attack Shade first, then shield_wall south if denial doesn't block it. Since denial blocks abilities and shield_wall is an ability, I can only attack. Attack Shade, then wait to keep fortify.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (3,3) and Bastion is adjacent at (4,4). My Denial passive is blocking their abilities. I have two wounded enemies in range. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - this would hit Ghost and Bastion both, but also check ally positions. Shade is at (4,5) and Deadeye at (4,2) - neither is within 1 tile of me at (4,3). Pulse would hit Ghost and Bastion for 1 each. Then I can attack Ghost to finish or weaken further. Pulse first to hit both, then attack Ghost (1HP if wounded? Ghost is healthy so 6HP base, pulse does 1 so still healthy after). Better to attack Ghost directly for 1dmg, then pulse to hit both Ghost and Bastion. Either way I deal 2 total to Ghost and 1 to Bastion. Let me pulse first (hits Ghost+Bastion), then attack Ghost.
  State: Shade 2/5, Snare 6/8, Deadeye 1/5, Ghost 3/5, Bastion 5/10, Lens 2/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, away from combat. I'm at (4,5) facing E. Valid moves include (5,5) which is the top-right corner — furthest from combat and away from allies clustered around (4,2)-(4,3). Move to (5,5) then wait.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare (vector, healthy) which is blocking my abilities via denial zone. Deadeye is at (4,2) critical HP — high value kill. I can reach (5,2) which is behind Deadeye and adjacent. From there I can breach or shadow_strike. But Snare's denial blocks breach/cloak — basic attack works though. Plan: move to (5,2) to get behind Deadeye and out of denial zone, then shadow_strike Deadeye (critical, likely kills or cripples). Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I'm cloaked — but I'm not cloaked. Use regular attack on Deadeye from behind at (5,2) — that's adjacent and should finish them off.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → scan(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — very fragile. Foresight shows Deadeye targeted me at (5,1) last turn with precision_shot, so I need to move. Shade is at dist=4 (just out of scan range from current pos). If I move to (5,4), I get closer to Shade and away from Deadeye's likely follow-up. But Snare is at (4,3) — moving to (5,4) keeps me at dist=3 from Snare, safe. From (5,4), Shade at (5,5) is dist=1 — adjacent, scan blocked by... wait, scan is blocked by adjacent Vector, not adjacent Specter. Snare is Vector. From (5,4), Snare at (4,3) is dist=2, not adjacent, so scan works. But Shade at (5,5) would be dist=1 from (5,4), within scan range (≤4). Actually I should move to (5,4) and scan Shade. Ghost is wounded nearby — but priority is getting intel on Shade and staying alive. Move to (5,4) to put Shade in scan range (dist=1), then scan Shade.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (4,3) and has DENIAL active — only basic attack works against it. I can attack Snare to suppress it. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) so staying put is safe. Attack Snare first, then shield_wall facing S to protect against Snare and the enemy cluster below.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (4,4) - I can pulse to hit multiple enemies. Ghost at (5,2) and Lens at (5,4) are both at dist 2. Pulsing from current position (4,3) hits Bastion at dist 1. Then I can attack Bastion directly since it's adjacent and wounded - finishing it would be valuable. Pulse first to hit Bastion (and potentially others in range), then attack Bastion to finish it off.
  State: Shade 1/5, Snare 5/8, Ghost 3/5, Bastion 3/10, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 6 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Snare (vector) is 2 tiles away at (4,3) facing N, and I'm already behind it. I can move to (4,2) which is directly behind Snare, then use breach to make it obey me next turn. This removes the vector denial zone and gives us a high-value sabotage. Shade is critical but at dist 3 and unreachable this turn. Priority: breach Snare.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP - very vulnerable. Shade is adjacent at (5,5) and critical - I already know their prompt. Snare is at (4,3), 2 tiles away, so I'm not adjacent and scan isn't blocked. Moving adjacent to Shade is dangerous given my low HP. I should move away from Shade to safety, then scan Snare since I'm already within range 4 and need more intel on them (though I already have their prompt). Actually both enemies are already scanned. I should recalibrate an ally - Ghost is wounded and their last action was shadow_strike. Moving to (3,4) gets me away from Shade and keeps me safer, then I can recalibrate Ghost at (4,2) - but Ghost is 2 tiles from (3,4), not adjacent. Let me check: from (3,4), Ghost at (4,2) is distance sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, not adjacent. Bastion is at (4,4), from (3,4) that's distance 1 - adjacent! I can recalibrate Bastion. Move to (3,4) first to escape Shade, then recalibrate Bastion who is wounded and fighting Snare.
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → breach(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 1HP — critically low. Ghost is at (4,2) facing W, and (5,2) is directly behind Ghost and reachable. I can move to (5,2) and then breach Ghost from behind. Ghost is wounded, so a breach could neutralize them. This is my best play: reposition behind Ghost and breach to take them out of the fight. Bastion and Lens are wounded too but I can't reach their rear tiles. Priority: eliminate wounded Ghost with breach from behind.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with Ghost adjacent at (4,2) and Bastion adjacent at (4,4). Both are wounded. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - that would hit both Ghost and Bastion simultaneously for 1dmg each, potentially finishing them. My ally Shade is at (5,2) critical - I need to be careful not to hurt them with pulse (they're 2 tiles away, outside pulse range). Pulse from (4,3) hits within 1 tile: Ghost(4,2) and Bastion(4,4) both take 1dmg. Ghost is wounded so this could finish it. After pulse, I should attack Ghost or move to better position. Actually, pulse first then attack Ghost to try to eliminate it.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 2HP, fortified, adjacent to Snare at (4,3). Snare is in DENIAL zone so only basic attack/movement work against it. I should attack Snare since it's adjacent and in range. I cannot use shield_wall due to DENIAL. Lens is wounded at (3,4) — I could shield_wall to protect Lens but DENIAL blocks it. Best play: attack Snare to deal damage, then wait to keep fortify bonus active (didn't move = 50% dmg reduction). Moving would lose fortify which is critical at 2HP.
  State: Shade 1/5, Snare 4/8, Ghost 1/5, Bastion 2/10, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Deadeye

### Turn 7 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): attack(5,2) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP and adjacent to Snare (vector with denial active). Orders say move away from ally Snare and attack Bastion at (4,4). However, I'm enemy Ghost - I should attack enemy Bastion at (4,4). Wait - orders say 'Move away from ally Snare' - but Snare is listed as enemy. Looking again: Snare is enemy vector. The orders seem to be from enemy perspective or confused. My actual situation: 1HP, adjacent to Shade (critical, dist=1) and Snare (wounded, dist=1). Denial zone blocks cloak/breach. I can use basic attack. Shade is critical - one hit kills. Shadow_strike keeps cloak (though I'm not cloaked). Attack Shade to eliminate them first, since they're critical. I'm already at (4,2), Shade is at (5,2). Move to (5,3) first to get behind Shade, but denial blocks abilities from current position. Actually, attack is a basic attack - it works in denial zone. Shadow_strike might be blocked. Let me use regular attack on Shade at (5,2) to finish them off (critical = likely 1HP), then move away.
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(4,4) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, critical condition. Snare is 2 tiles away - I must not move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. I already have Snare's prompt. Bastion is critical at (4,4) and could use recalibrate to help them. I can recalibrate Bastion since they're adjacent to me at (4,4). Then I should move away to safety - move to (2,4) or (1,4) to get further from Snare while staying alive. Actually, recalibrate first then move away. Bastion is adjacent at (4,4), I can recalibrate them with tactical advice about Snare's denial zone. Then move west to (1,4) to get out of danger.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with Fortify active (50% DR). Snare is adjacent at (4,3) and DENIAL blocks my abilities except basic attack. I should attack Snare since it's wounded and adjacent. Moving would break Fortify and I can't use shield_wall anyway due to DENIAL. Best play: attack Snare then wait to keep Fortify, or attack and hold position.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,3) with 3HP, surrounded by two critical enemies: Bastion at (4,4) adjacent to my north, Ghost at (3,2) dist=2. Both are critical so I can finish them. Bastion is adjacent - pulse will hit it (1 tile AoE). Ghost is at dist=2, within pulse range if I move closer, or I can attack Bastion directly. Pulse from current position hits Bastion at (4,4) (dist=1). Ghost at (3,2) is dist=2, outside pulse range. I should pulse to hit Bastion, then move away or set a trap. Actually, pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - Bastion is at dist=1 so pulse hits it. If Bastion is critical (low HP), pulse might finish it. Then I can move to safety. Let me pulse first to hit Bastion, then move to (5,3) to get away from Ghost.
  State: Snare 3/8, Ghost 1/5, Bastion 1/10, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Shade, Deadeye

### Turn 8 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(4,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, critical condition. Snare is at distance 5, out of scan range (4). Both allies are critical too. Bastion at (4,4) is adjacent to me and needs recalibrate support. I should move closer to Snare to get in scan range, but staying safe is priority at 2HP. Recalibrate Bastion first to give tactical advice about Snare's denial ability and chokepoint control, then reposition toward (3,4) to stay safe while moving slightly toward the action.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from ally Snare and attack Bastion at (4,4). Bastion is at (4,4) which is adjacent to my current position (3,2)? No — distance from (3,2) to (4,4) is 2 tiles, not adjacent. I need to move adjacent to Bastion first, then attack. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (4,4) and also behind Snare — but orders say attack Bastion. At 1HP I'm critical. Move to (4,3) to get adjacent to Bastion, then use attack on Bastion at (4,4). Note: (4,3) is also behind Snare but orders are to attack Bastion.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(5,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,3) and critical - I'm at 3HP myself so this is dangerous. I can't use trap while adjacent to Ghost (enemy Vector blocks it). I should pulse to hit Ghost for 1dmg which may finish it if it's critical, plus I'm at range 1. Then move away to safety. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile of me - Ghost is at dist 1 so it gets hit. I don't want to move first since Ghost is adjacent and I need to pulse now.
  State: Snare 3/8, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Shade, Deadeye, Ghost, Bastion

### Turn 9 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(5,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — very fragile. Snare is wounded and 2 tiles away at (5,4). I already have their prompt. I should not move adjacent to Snare or I'll be blocked. I can scan Snare from current position (dist=2, within range 4) to deal 1 damage and potentially finish them if wounded means low HP. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to Snare — dangerous. Stay at (3,4) and scan Snare for damage, then consider recalibrating an ally. Foresight shows Ghost was at (4,3) last turn attacking (4,4) — Ghost may be nearby. I'll scan Snare from current position for damage, then wait or move away.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 2HP - very low health. Lens is at (2,4) dist=3, out of my range. There's a trap at (2,3). I need to move closer to threaten Lens while setting up denial. Move to (3,4) to get adjacent range and place a trap to block Lens's escape route or place it at (3,3) to complement existing trap at (2,3). At 2HP I'm fragile - closing distance risks getting hit but I need to contribute. Move to (3,4) puts me at dist=1 from Lens, enabling denial passive to block their abilities and attack for 1dmg. Then I can attack Lens directly.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP, critical danger. Snare is adjacent at (3,4) and has DENIAL active blocking my abilities. I can only attack or move. Snare is at critical HP — a basic attack could finish it. But I need to survive. Best play: attack Snare to try to eliminate it (it's critical, likely 1HP), then move away to safety. Attack first, then flee west.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with only 1HP - critically low. Lens is at (0,4) distance 3, moving west. There's already a trap at (2,3). I need to survive. I should move away from danger while placing a trap to slow Lens's approach. Moving to (2,4) puts me closer to Lens which is dangerous. Moving to (4,4) or (4,5) gets me further away. I'll retreat to (4,5) to gain distance, then place a trap at (2,4) to block Lens's path toward me - that's the likely corridor they'll use.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical. Snare is at (4,5), dist 5, out of scan range. I went first this round. Foresight shows Snare failed a trap last turn. I need to survive. Moving away to safety is priority — no enemies in range, so I should reposition to stay alive. Move to (2,4) to get closer for potential scan next turn while staying safe.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 1HP - critical condition. Lens is at (2,4) facing East, dist=3. There's already a trap at (2,3). I need to stay alive and control space. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer but risks exposure. Better to move to (3,5) to approach while staying on the flank, then place a trap at (3,4) to block Lens's path - creating a zone between us. With only 1HP I must avoid direct engagement.
