If I move to (2,4), Viper is at (3,3) = distance 2, can't attack. If I move to (2,3) Viper is adjacent and I can attack for 1dmg, but scan is still blocked. Viper is healthy so 1dmg doesn't help much. Marksman is critical — if I move to (3,5) then scan Marksman at (5,5) dist=2, but already scanned. Recalibrate on Hawk at (4,4) to help finish Marksman.
