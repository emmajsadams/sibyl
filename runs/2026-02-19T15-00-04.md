## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Viper** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
### Opponent
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Snare** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is exactly at scan range (dist=4). Scan it to reveal its strategy and deal 1 damage. Then recalibrate Doc or Snare — Snare is adjacent-ish but recalibrate requires adjacent. Snare is at (1,4), I'm at (4,4), dist=3, not adjacent. Doc is at (2,5), dist=3, not adjacent. No ally is adjacent so recalibrate isn't possible. I'll scan Warden and wait.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are far away. I should position to support allies — moving toward (3,4) gets me closer to the action while staying safe. No good overclock targets adjacent to me yet. I'll move and wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at dist=4, just within my range of 3 (High Ground passive gives +1 range if no adjacent enemy). I'm at (1,0) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground applies giving range 4. Snare is exactly at dist=4. I can use precision_shot for 2 damage if I don't move. Stay in place and fire.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Insight at (4,4), distance 4. I'm at (4,0) with move 2. Moving north to (4,2) closes distance to 2. Enemies are mostly to the north, so shield_wall facing N after moving.
- **Viper** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Enemies are 4-5 tiles away, closing from the north. I should advance and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer and lets me place a trap at (2,4) or (3,4) — tiles enemies will likely pass through. I'll move north first, then drop a trap on a chokepoint tile ahead.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(1,2) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Viper is 2 tiles away at (2,3) — I must not move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. Hawk is approaching from (1,0) heading north, likely to move up through (1,1), (1,2). I should place a trap on a tile in Hawk's likely path. Moving to (1,2) would put me adjacent to Viper, so I'll stay or move west. I can place a trap at (1,2) from current position (1,4) — distance is 2, which is within trap range. That covers Hawk's northward advance. I'll place the trap first, then move to (0,4) to reposition away from Viper.
  State: Hawk 4/4, Warden 8/10, Viper 6/6, Snare 4/6, Insight 9/9, Doc 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Viper is in scan range at dist=3 and not yet scanned — revealing their strategy is top priority. I need to stay out of adjacent range to Viper (currently at 2,3). I'm at 4,4 which is fine. I can scan Viper from current position (dist=3 ≤ 4). Then I could move to maintain safe distance. Warden is already scanned. Hawk is out of range. Scanning Viper also deals 1 damage which is a bonus.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (min dist 5, my range is 3). Need to advance to get enemies in range. Moving to (1,2) gets me 2 tiles closer to enemies while staying away from Snare at (0,4). From (1,2) enemies are still out of range but I'm better positioned. No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive applies giving range 4, but still not enough. Best move is toward center to close distance while maintaining options.
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,4) ✓ → patch(0,4) ✓
  💭 Snare at (0,4) is wounded at 4/6 HP and needs healing. I'm at (3,4) and Snare is 3 tiles away — not adjacent, so I can't heal yet. I need to move closer. Moving to (1,4) gets me adjacent to Snare at (0,4) so I can patch. Viper is at (2,3) — if I move to (1,4), distance to Viper becomes 2, so I stay safe. After moving to (1,4), Snare at (0,4) is adjacent, so I can patch for 2HP.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(5,4) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Insight at (5,4), dist 3. Moving to (4,4) closes to dist 1, then (5,4) would be adjacent next turn. Valid move tiles include (4,4). Moving north toward Insight. After moving to (4,4), no enemy adjacent so no attack. Use shield_wall facing N (toward enemies clustered north) to protect allies.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(1,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Doc is 2 tiles away at (1,4) and within trap range. I can place a trap on (1,3) which is between my position and Doc — a natural movement corridor. Then move to (3,3) to reposition toward Warden for mutual support while staying away from Snare's denial range. Pulse isn't worth it with only one enemy adjacent.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Hawk at (1,2) is closest at dist 3, moving north toward us. I should advance toward (1,3) to cut off Hawk's approach, then place a trap at (1,2) or on the path. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to where Hawk is, giving denial aura coverage. Then trap at (2,3) to cover Viper's approach corridor.
  State: Hawk 2/4, Warden 8/10, Viper 4/6, Snare 4/6, Insight 9/9, Doc 9/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks scan per rules — scan requires target within 4 tiles but also I should avoid being adjacent to enemy Vector. Warden is already scanned. Viper is at dist=3, already scanned too. Hawk is out of range at dist=6. I should reposition to get Hawk in scan range while staying safe. Moving to (3,5) puts me further from Viper and gives better positioning. After moving, I can scan Viper again for damage (dist would be ~3 from new position) — wait, Viper already scanned. Best use: scan deals 1 damage, so scan Viper for damage since both are already known. From (5,4), Viper at (3,3) is dist=3, in scan range. I'm not adjacent to Viper. Scan Viper for 1 damage. Then move away from Warden who is adjacent and advancing.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare's denial zone at (1,3), which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away to use precision_shot. Moving to (2,2) gets me out of denial and gives distance from Snare. From (2,2), Doc at (1,4) is dist 2.2 - not in range cleanly. Snare at (1,3) would be dist ~1.4, within range 3. After moving to (2,2), I can use precision_shot on Snare (dist ~1.4, in range 3, no longer adjacent so not blocked). With 2HP I need to be careful. Move to (2,1) to get out of denial zone and reposition. From (2,1): Snare@(1,3) dist=2.2, Doc@(1,4) dist=3.2. Actually move to (2,2): Snare dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41, Doc dist=sqrt(1+4)=2.24. Both in range 3. Precision_shot on Snare deals 2dmg - if I haven't moved first I get full 2dmg. Move first then shoot Snare for 1dmg (moved penalty). Better: shoot first then move. But denial blocks abilities at current position. So I must move first, then shoot for 1dmg (moved). Move to (2,2) then precision_shot Snare for 1dmg. Or move to (0,1) to retreat further. Orders say retreat from threats if forced to move. But killing Snare is priority. Move to (2,2), precision_shot Snare (1dmg after moving).
- **Doc** (medic): patch(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is at (1,3) with 3/6 HP and needs healing. I'm at (1,4) — Snare is adjacent (directly south). I should patch Snare immediately. After healing, I can wait or reposition. Viper is at (3,3), dist=3, so not adjacent — patch is not blocked. I'll patch Snare this turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Insight at (5,5), dist=2. I can move to (4,5) to get adjacent. No enemies adjacent at current position. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Enemies are at (1,3), (5,5), (1,4) — most enemies are to the west/south. If I move to (4,5), Insight is at (5,5) which is adjacent to my east. I should move to (4,5) then shield_wall facing E or W depending on enemy clustering. Doc@(1,4) and Snare@(1,3) are both west. Insight@(5,5) is east. Two enemies west, one east — shield_wall W makes more sense for blocking. But orders also say attack if adjacent — after moving to (4,5), Insight at (5,5) is adjacent (dist=1), so I should attack instead.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (2,2) wounded and dist=2, Viper at (3,3) wounded and dist=2. There's already a trap at (2,3). Viper is 2 tiles away so I'm not adjacent — trap ability should work. Hawk is wounded and likely to move through (2,3) where trap already sits. I should place a trap at (2,4) or (1,2) to cover likely movement paths. Viper at (3,3) might move toward me — placing trap at (2,4) covers approach. I can place trap from current position (1,3) targeting (2,4) which is within range 2. Then wait or move slightly to maintain positioning near Doc at (1,4).
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 At 2/6 HP I'm fragile. Snare is 2 tiles away at (1,3) — if I stay or move adjacent, my trap ability gets blocked by denial. I need to place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to cross. Doc is at (1,4) moving west, Snare at (1,3) moving south — tile (2,3) or (3,2) could be a good trap location. I can move to (4,3) to gain distance from Snare while staying in range, then place a trap on (3,3) my current tile or a likely path tile. Actually, moving to (4,3) first keeps me at dist 3 from Snare (out of denial concern), then I can trap (3,3) which enemies would cross approaching. Valid trap range from (4,3): ≤2 tiles means I can reach (2,3),(3,3),(4,1),(4,2),(4,4),(5,3) etc. Tile (3,3) is my current position — enemies moving east would hit it. That's a solid trap location.
  State: Hawk 2/4, Warden 8/10, Viper 2/6, Snare 6/6, Insight 8/9, Doc 9/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent (dist=1) and already scanned — no need to scan again. Hawk is out of scan range. Viper is at dist=3, within scan range. I should scan Viper to deal 1 damage (already wounded) and confirm prompt — wait, already scanned. Viper prompt known. My priority: Hawk is unscanned but out of range at dist=6. I need to move closer to scan Hawk. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer — dist from (3,4) to Hawk(2,2) = 1+2=3, within range 4. But I must avoid getting adjacent to Viper at (4,3) — (3,4) is dist=2 from Viper, safe. From (3,4) I can scan Hawk at (2,2), dist=3. Also, Warden is adjacent now and will attack me — moving away is smart. Move to (3,4), then scan Hawk at (2,2).
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is wounded at (3,4) with 8/9 HP, dist=2. I need to move adjacent to heal. Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Insight at (3,4). But (2,4) is a trap tile. Moving to (2,5) is safe and gets me dist=1 from Insight at (3,4) — adjacent diagonally? No, adjacency is cardinal only. From (2,5), Insight at (3,4) is dist=2 (not adjacent). I need to be at (3,4)±1 cardinal: (2,4),(4,4),(3,3),(3,5). Valid moves include (2,4) but it's a trap. (2,5) is safe but not adjacent to Insight. I can't reach Insight this turn without hitting a trap. Best option: move to (2,5) to get closer safely, then wait. Actually let me reconsider — I only have 1 heal left and Insight is only at 8/9 (minor wound). Snare is full HP. Enemies are far. I'll move toward (2,5) to reposition safely away from traps, and wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,5) with 50% damage reduction. Nearest enemies are Insight at (3,4) dist=2 and Doc at (2,5) dist=2. No enemies adjacent so can't attack. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to both Insight and Doc. From (3,5), enemies are to the W (Doc at 2,5) and SW (Insight at 3,4). Most enemies are to the W/SW. I'll move to (3,5) then use shield_wall facing W to cover the western approach where Doc is.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 HP is critically low at 2/6. Insight (oracle) is in range at dist=2. There's already a trap at (3,3). I should place a trap on a likely enemy movement tile to deny space, then consider positioning. Snare is 3 tiles away so I need to stay out of adjacent range. Insight is at (3,4) and likely to move toward me or through center. I can place a trap at (4,4) which is on my valid moves list and along a likely approach route. Then I should stay put or move to (5,3) to maintain distance from Snare while keeping pressure. Actually, with 2HP I should prioritize survival - move away from Snare while placing a trap. Move to (5,3) first to increase distance from Snare, then place trap at (4,4) to catch Insight if they advance.
- **Snare** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist=4, out of range. I already have traps at (2,3) and (2,4) covering approaches from the right. Warden is at (3,5) and Viper at (5,3). I should move toward the center-right to place more traps on likely enemy paths. Moving to (3,3) puts me in a good position to cover more ground and place a trap on a tile enemies must pass through. From (3,3), I can place a trap at (4,3) or (3,4) to intercept enemy movement.
  State: Warden 8/10, Viper 2/6, Snare 4/6, Insight 8/9, Doc 9/9 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 5 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(3,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Warden is adjacent at (3,5) - dangerous but already known. Viper is wounded at (5,3), 3 tiles away - priority to finish off. I should recalibrate Snare (our vector damage dealer at (3,3)) to boost their effectiveness against Viper. But first I need to reposition - Warden is adjacent and could attack me. Move west to (2,4) to create distance from Warden while staying in range to recalibrate Snare. From (2,4), Snare at (3,3) is still adjacent (dist=√2... wait, recalibrate is adjacent only meaning 1 tile). (2,4) to (3,3) is distance √2 ≈ 1.41, that's diagonal - may not count as adjacent. Let me reconsider. Stay at (3,4) and recalibrate Snare at (3,3) which is 1 tile south - definitely adjacent. Then move away from Warden. Actually: ability first (recalibrate Snare), then move west away from Warden to (2,4). Trap at (2,3) and (2,4) - wait, (2,4) is a valid move tile so it should be passable. The traps are enemy hazards I should avoid stepping on. (2,4) has a trap! Avoid that. Move to (1,4) instead - clear of traps and away from Warden.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 1 heal remaining. Insight is wounded at 8/9 HP at (1,4), dist=2. Snare is more wounded at 4/6 HP at (3,3), dist=3. Orders say prioritize lowest HP ally. I need to get to Snare but they're at dist=3 and blocked by traps at (2,4) and (2,3). Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Snare at (3,3) — dist=1, and avoids traps. Warden is at (3,5) dist=1, healthy ally sentinel. If I move to (3,4), I'll be adjacent to Snare and can patch them. But wait — patch is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Viper is at (5,3), dist=5, not adjacent, so patch is not blocked. Move to (3,4) then patch Snare at (3,3).
- **Snare** (vector): attack(5,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Viper at (5,3) is wounded and priority target. I'm at (3,3). There's already a trap at (4,3) between us. I can attack Viper from current position (dist=2, within range 2). I should attack Viper first to try to finish them off. Then move to (4,3)... wait, (4,3) has a trap - avoid that. Move to (4,2) to pressure Viper while avoiding the trap. Actually, attack first from (3,3) then move toward Viper. Viper is 2 tiles away so attack is in range. After attacking, move to (4,2) to stay close without stepping on trap at (4,3).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent to the south at (3,4). Orders say attack if enemy is adjacent. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Doc first, then use shield_wall facing south where Doc and other enemies are clustered.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP so I need to play carefully. Snare is at (4,2) dist=2 — I must not move adjacent or my trap ability gets blocked. (4,4) already has a trap. I should place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to move through. Doc is at (3,4) moving south, Insight at (1,4) moving west — they may converge around (4,4) area or approach via (5,4)/(5,5). I can move to (5,4) or (5,5) to gain distance from Snare while placing a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (5,5) keeps me away from Snare and I can trap (5,4) or (4,4) — but (4,4) already has a trap. Let me move to (5,5) first, then place a trap at (5,4) which enemies approaching from the north-west would pass through. Actually, Warden is at (3,5) — I should stay near ally. Move to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Snare — blocked. Move to (5,4) is valid and keeps distance from Snare (dist would be ~2 from 4,2). From (5,4) I can trap (4,4) but that's already trapped. I'll move to (5,5) to be safer and further from Snare, then trap (5,4) as a chokepoint for enemies approaching.
  State: Warden 8/10, Viper 2/6, Snare 6/6, Insight 8/9, Doc 8/9 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 6 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is already scanned and within range at (3,5), dist 3. Viper is out of range at dist 5. Both enemies already scanned. I should recalibrate Doc or Snare to boost their effectiveness, then move to a safer position. Traps at (2,3) and (2,4) block some movement south. I'll recalibrate Doc at (3,4) — adjacent? No, Doc is at (3,4) and I'm at (1,4), dist 2, not adjacent. Snare is at (4,2), also not adjacent. No allies are adjacent to me. I can't recalibrate anyone. Warden is in scan range but already scanned. Viper is out of range. Both already scanned so scanning again yields limited new info. Best play: move toward a position where I can recalibrate an ally or get Viper in scan range next turn, while avoiding traps at (2,3),(2,4) and staying away from enemy vectors. Moving to (2,5) keeps me safe, avoids traps, and positions me better. Then wait as second action.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(3,5) ✗ No ally at target → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Insight is wounded at (2,5) dist=2, but I can't heal. Warden is adjacent at (3,5) — friendly sentinel, so I can overclock them to boost their next turn. Warden is healthy and in melee range of Viper likely. Move to (2,5) to get adjacent to Insight for overclock? Insight is at dist=2 so not adjacent. I'm at (3,4). To reach Insight at (2,5) I'd need to move there — that's 2 tiles away. Valid moves include tiles but (2,5) not listed. I can move to (4,4) or stay. Warden is adjacent at (3,5) — I can overclock Warden now without moving. Overclock gives Warden 2 abilities next turn, which is strong for a sentinel. I take 1 damage but I'm at 8/9. Let me overclock Warden at (3,5).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) E ✓
  💭 Insight is adjacent at (2,5). Orders say attack if enemy is adjacent. I'll attack Insight first, then use shield_wall facing East where Doc and Snare are located.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with only 2HP - critically low. Doc is at (4,4) distance 2, which is in my trap range. There's already a trap at (5,4). I need to be careful - I can't place traps when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Snare is at distance 4 so that's fine. Doc is a medic and likely to move toward allies. I should place a trap on a tile Doc might cross. (4,5) is a valid move tile and also between Doc and the battlefield. I could move to (4,5) to get closer to Warden for support, but that might put me adjacent to Doc. Better to place a trap at (4,5) from current position to catch Doc if they move north, then wait. Actually, traps need to target empty tiles within range 2. (4,5) is empty and within range 2. Let me place trap there to catch Doc moving north, then wait to conserve my low HP.
- **Snare** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Viper is at (5,5) wounded - I need to close in. Moving to (5,3) puts me at distance 2 from Viper, within range. Then I can place a trap at (5,4) which is directly between me and Viper - they'll likely move through it to engage or retreat. This also keeps me positioned to pulse if they close in next turn. I already have a trap at (4,3) so I should move to (5,3) and place a trap at (5,4) to cut off Viper's path.
  State: Warden 8/10, Viper 2/6, Snare 6/6, Insight 7/9, Doc 6/9 | Dead: Hawk

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(5,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,5) — I already know its prompt so no need to scan again. Viper is wounded at (5,5), distance 3, within scan range and already scanned. I should move away from Warden to avoid its attack and stay out of adjacent range. Moving to (1,5) puts me 2 tiles from Warden (safe) and 4 tiles from Viper (still in scan range). From there I can recalibrate Snare or Doc, but both are not adjacent from any valid move. Actually, let me recalibrate Doc at (4,4) — from my current position (2,5), Doc is at distance 3, not adjacent. I need to get adjacent to an ally to recalibrate. No ally is adjacent or reachable adjacently. So I should scan Viper (wounded, dist 3, in range) for 1 damage — but Viper is a vector and I'm not adjacent to it so scan is NOT blocked. Warden is adjacent but Warden is a sentinel not a vector, so scan is not blocked. Scan Viper at (5,5) deals 1 damage to the wounded target. Then move away from Warden to (1,5) to stay safe.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Insight is wounded at (1,5) but is 4 tiles away - can't reach this turn. Warden enemy is at (3,5), dist 2. I should move toward Insight to eventually heal, but need to stay safe. Valid moves include (4,5) which gets me closer to Insight while staying near Snare. No overclock targets adjacent. I'll move to (4,5) to close distance toward Insight, then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) E ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent at (4,5) and wounded — attack for easy damage. Then shield_wall facing East where both Doc and Snare are, protecting against incoming threats. I'm fortified so staying put is fine.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is at (3,5), distance 4, out of range. No enemies in range currently. I have traps at (2,3), (2,4), (4,3), (5,4). Orders say to place traps on likely enemy movement paths. Warden is moving west from (3,5) - likely paths include tiles toward our allies at (1,5) and (4,5). I should move closer to engage and place a trap on a likely path. Moving to (5,5) puts me closer to Doc at (4,5) for support and lets me place a trap at (4,4) or nearby. Actually, (5,4) already has a trap. Let me move to (4,4) to get within range 2 of Warden's area, then place a trap at (3,5) or nearby to cut off movement. Wait - trap range is ≤2 tiles from me. From (4,4), I can trap tiles within 2 tiles. (3,5) is distance ~2.2, not reachable. From (5,5), trap at (3,5) is dist ~2.8, no. Best move: go to (4,4) and trap (3,4) or (4,5) - likely Warden movement path toward Doc.
  State: Warden 8/10, Snare 6/6, Insight 7/9, Doc 3/9 | Dead: Hawk, Viper

### Turn 8 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is already scanned at (3,5), 2 tiles away. Doc is wounded at (4,5) — Warden attacked Doc last turn. I should recalibrate Snare (my damage dealer) to boost effectiveness, then stay safe. Snare is at (4,4). To recalibrate Snare, I need to be adjacent. Snare is at (4,4), I'm at (1,5) — too far. Doc is adjacent-ish but wounded. Best play: move closer to Snare to recalibrate, but I must not get adjacent to enemy vectors. Warden is a sentinel not vector, so adjacency is fine. Moving to (2,5) keeps me at range. Actually I should recalibrate Snare — need to be adjacent to (4,4). That would require moving to (3,4) or (4,3) etc., but (3,4) is a trap and (4,3) is a trap. Can't safely reach Snare adjacency. Instead, I can scan Warden again? No, already scanned. Better to move to maintain position and wait, or scan... wait, Warden is already scanned. No other enemies in range. I'll move to (2,5) to maintain distance and wait — preserving HP while staying safe.
- **Doc** (medic): attack(3,5) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 3HP and adjacent to enemy Warden at (3,5). No heals remaining. Insight is wounded at (2,5) but not adjacent. Valid moves are (3,4), (4,3), (5,4), (5,5) — all trap tiles except (5,5). I should move to (5,5) to escape the Warden's threat, then attack the Warden as my second action since I'm still adjacent after moving to (5,5)... wait, (5,5) is distance 2 from Warden at (3,5), so no attack range. Better to attack first while adjacent, then move to (5,5) to safety.
- **Snare** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is at (3,5), distance 2 from my position (4,4). Orders mention Viper at (5,3) is wounded - but I see no Viper in current enemy data, only Warden. I should focus on what's visible. Warden is healthy at (3,5). I have traps already at (3,4) and (4,3). I can attack Warden from range 2 with my attack ability (range adjacent only - wait, attack is adjacent only). Pulse hits all within 1 tile. Warden is at distance 2, so pulse won't reach. I can't use trap when adjacent to an enemy Vector - but I'm not adjacent to anyone. I could move to (4,5) to get adjacent to Warden at (3,5) and then attack, or place a trap. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Warden - I can then attack for 1 dmg. Or I could move to (5,3) which is a valid move tile - that's where Viper supposedly is. Let me move to (5,3) to investigate/engage Viper, and if no one is there, I'm in a good position. Actually valid moves include (5,3) and (5,4). Moving to (4,5) gets me adjacent to Warden for an attack. I'll move to (4,5) and attack Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare at (4,5) and Insight at (2,5). Orders say attack adjacent enemy. Snare has DENIAL active blocking my abilities, so I can only use basic attack or move. I should attack Snare since it's the threat with DENIAL. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) so staying put is good. After attacking Snare, I can't use shield_wall due to DENIAL zone, so I'll wait.

- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(4,5) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,5) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel, not a vector. However, scan requires target within 4 tiles and Warden is already scanned. I should recalibrate Snare (my damage dealer at (4,5)) to boost effectiveness, then move away from Warden to maintain range. Move to (1,5) first to create distance, then recalibrate Snare. Wait — recalibrate is adjacent only, so I need to be adjacent to Snare at (4,5) to recalibrate. Currently at (2,5), Snare is at (4,5) — not adjacent. Better to move toward Snare first. Move to (3,5)? No, Warden is there. Move to (4,4) to get adjacent to Snare at (4,5), then recalibrate. (4,4) is in valid moves list. From (4,4), Snare at (4,5) is adjacent (dist=1). This lets me recalibrate Snare. But this puts me closer to Warden at (3,5) — dist would be ~1.4 tiles (diagonal), not adjacent. Good.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Snare is adjacent at (4,5) with 5/6 HP. Insight is at (4,4) with 7/9 HP, not adjacent. I can't heal anyone. Overclock on Snare (adjacent) could give them 2 abilities next turn - useful since Warden is nearby at dist 2. I take 1 damage from overclock but I'm at 3HP so that leaves me at 2HP. Valid moves are (5,3) and (5,4). I should overclock Snare to maximize their damage output against Warden. I'll stay put or move to (5,4) to stay safe behind Snare.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (4,5). Orders say attack if adjacent. I'm fortified which is good for defense. Attack Snare with basic attack since DENIAL zone blocks other abilities. I'll stay put to keep fortify bonus.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm overclocked with 2 ability uses. Warden is adjacent at (3,5) and wounded. I'll attack twice to finish it off. Pulse would hit Warden (dist=1) but might also hit Doc at (5,5) which is dist=1 from me — risky. Direct attack is safer. Two attacks on wounded Warden should eliminate it.
  State: Warden 4/10, Snare 3/6, Insight 7/9, Doc 3/9 | Dead: Hawk, Viper

### Turn 10 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is already scanned and wounded at (3,5). Foresight shows Warden will attack (4,5) where Snare and Doc are. I should recalibrate Snare at (4,5) to boost their damage output since they're attacking Warden this turn. I'm at (4,4), Snare is at (4,5) which is adjacent — I can recalibrate them. No need to move since I can reach Snare from here. After recalibrate, I'll wait as I have no other useful actions.
- **Doc** (medic): overclock(4,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Snare is adjacent at (4,5) with 3/6 HP - I can use overclock on Snare to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could be valuable. Warden is at dist 2, not adjacent to me so overclock isn't blocked. After overclocking Snare, I should reposition to (5,4) to stay behind and safe.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (4,5) and I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm in Snare's denial zone so shield_wall is blocked, but basic attack still works. Attack Snare first, then stay fortified (don't move to keep 50% DR).
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,5) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 1HP and overclocked (2 ability uses). Warden is adjacent at (3,5) wounded. I need to attack Warden twice to finish them. Pulse hits all adjacent units within 1 tile for 1dmg - that would hit Warden. Attack also hits adjacent for 1dmg. With 2 ability uses from overclock, I can use pulse + attack to deal 2 damage total to Warden. Warden is wounded so this should finish them. I'll stay put and use both abilities on Warden.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is already scanned and critical. My allies Snare and Doc are both critical. I should recalibrate Snare at (4,5) to boost their effectiveness since they're adjacent to me and are our main damage dealer. Then wait since Warden is already known and I don't need to scan again.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 1HP and 0 heals left. I'm standing on a trap at (5,4). Snare is at (4,5) with 1HP but dist=2 and patch is unavailable. Insight is at (4,4) with 6/9HP. I can't heal anyone. I should move off this trap to safety. Valid moves: (5,5) gets me off the trap and away from danger. Warden is at (3,5) dist=3, not adjacent. I could overclock Insight at (4,4) - they're adjacent to me currently. Let me check: Insight is at (4,4), I'm at (5,4) - that's adjacent! Overclock would give Insight 2 abilities next turn which could be very powerful for an oracle. I take 1 damage but I'm already at 1HP... that would kill me. So no overclock. Best play: move to (5,5) to get off the trap, then wait.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) with 1HP - critically wounded. Warden is adjacent at (3,5) and critical. I need to use pulse to hit Warden (within 1 tile) and finish them off. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile for 1 damage - Warden is at distance 1 so this works. I should pulse first to eliminate Warden, then wait since I'm at 1HP and need to avoid taking damage. Doc is at (5,5) also critical.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP so I'm extremely vulnerable. Snare is adjacent at (4,5) and critical - I should attack to finish them. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) which helps survival. The denial zone blocks abilities but basic attack should still work. Attack Snare first since they're adjacent and critical, then I can reassess. Stay in place to keep fortify active.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is at (3,5), dist 2, critical HP, already scanned. I'm at (4,4). Trap at (4,3) blocks south. Trap at (5,4) blocks east. Valid moves include (4,5) which is north and safe. Warden is critical - scan already done. I should recalibrate an ally to boost them, or just wait since Warden is nearly dead. Foresight shows Warden attacked (4,5) last turn - if I move to (4,5) I may get attacked. Better to stay or move elsewhere. Actually I can move to (5,5) to maintain range and avoid traps. Warden is adjacent to me at dist 2, not adjacent (dist 1), so scan is not blocked. But scan already done on Warden. No other enemies in range. I'll move to (5,5) to avoid trap at (5,4)... wait (5,4) is a trap, (5,5) is valid. Then recalibrate an ally - but recalibrate is adjacent only. At (4,4) who is adjacent? Need to check. Foresight shows Doc at (5,5) last turn. I'll move to (4,5) - but Warden attacked there last turn, risky. Move to (5,5) instead and wait since no scan targets available.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,5) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 At 1 HP I'm extremely vulnerable. Insight is at (5,5), distance 2. I need to move closer to attack. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Insight at (5,5). Then I can attack. I'm fortified but moving will remove that — worth it to finish off a wounded enemy.
