I should attack Aegis to finish them off since they're critical. My denial passive also blocks their abilities since I'm at dist 2 — wait, denial only works on adjacent enemies. Aegis is at dist 2 so not adjacent. I can attack Aegis (range 2? No — attack is adjacent only, range=1). Pulse hits all within 1 tile — Aegis is at dist 2, too far. I could move to (5,4)... but Wraith is there. Move to (4,4) — trap is there. Valid moves are [3,3],[4,2],[4,3],[4,4],[5,1],[5,2]. Wait, (4,4) has a trap. I can't reach (5,5) in one move (dist 2, mv 2 — but spd:1 so only 1 move? No mv:2 means I can move up to 2 tiles). Actually my mv is shown as mv2 but spd:1. Let me check valid moves — (5,2) is listed but not (5,4) or (5,5). So I can't reach Aegis directly. Best option: place a trap between positions to deny Aegis movement, or pulse if possible. Pulse range is 1 tile AoE — I need to be adjacent to Aegis. I can't reach adjacency. I'll place a trap at (5,4) to block Aegis from moving south toward my position — but Wraith is at (5,4). Try trap at (4,3) — already has one. Place trap at (5,2) to create denial zone, or stay and use pulse on current position which won't hit anyone. Best: move closer and trap. Move to (4,3) has a trap. Move to (4,2) is safe, then trap at (4,3)? No trap on occupied tiles. Actually let me re-read: I can move to (5,2) and trap somewhere useful. Or stay and trap at (5,4) if valid — Wraith is there so can't trap. Stay and trap at an empty tile near Aegis's path. Aegis at (5,5), likely to move south. Trap at (5,4) blocked by Wraith. No good trap spots from here. Best action: wait/hold denial on Aegis if they approach, or move to threaten. I'll move toward (4,3) — wait it has a trap. Move to (4,2) and trap (5,2) as escape denial.",
