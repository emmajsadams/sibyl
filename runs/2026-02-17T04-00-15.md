## Squads
### Player
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
### Opponent
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: cloak immediately as instructed, then advance toward enemy backline (Watcher at 2,5) to set up future breach opportunities
- **Marksman** (striker): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemies out of range (dist 6). Move south to (0,2) to close distance while maintaining range advantage. Next turn can precision_shot Longshot (damage dealer priority).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(0,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Marksman is in range at (0,2). Use precision_shot for 2dmg without moving first to maximize damage. Then move to (4,2) for better positioning and maintain distance from threats.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → scan(4,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of scan range (dist 5 > 4). Need to move closer. Longshot at (4,2) is the priority threat as a striker. Moving to (3,4) gets me within 4 tiles of Longshot (dist 3) while staying behind my Bastion. Then scan Longshot to reveal their strategy.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Enemy Marksman at (0,2) is wounded and closest threat. Move north toward frontline at (2,2) to position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall facing north to protect allies from incoming threats.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) S ✓
  💭 Push forward to engage. Move to (2,3) to close distance on Bastion. Then shield_wall facing S to protect Marksman from enemy fire.
  State: Bastion 10/10, Veil 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Marksman 2/4, Bastion 10/10, Watcher 8/8

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): breach(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and adjacent. I'm cloaked and behind them. Perfect breach opportunity to turn their striker against their team.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to focus Watcher at (3,4), but I'm a striker with range 3 and Watcher is at distance 5. Veil (specter) is adjacent, blocking precision_shot. Need to reposition toward Watcher while dealing with threats. Move to (1,3) to get closer to Watcher (dist 3) and away from Veil, then precision_shot Watcher.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and in range. Use precision_shot to finish them off without moving for max damage (2dmg). No movement needed since all enemies are in range.
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) at (0,3) is at max scan range (4 tiles) and hasn't been scanned yet. Enemy Bastion at (2,2) blocks direct approach. I should scan Veil this turn to reveal their strategy, then reposition if needed. Staying at (3,4) keeps me behind my allied Bastion and maintains safe distance from threats.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall S ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion at (2,2) is adjacent. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. The cluster is south of me. I'll attack the adjacent Bastion first, then shield_wall facing south to protect against the southern enemies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall S ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion adjacent at (2,3). Attack to deal damage, then shield_wall south to block incoming damage to allies behind me.
  State: Bastion 9/10, Veil 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 9/10, Watcher 7/8 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Bastion at (2,3) is 2 tiles away. I can move to (2,4) which is behind Bastion (facing S), then use breach to sabotage this high-value sentinel.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(2,2) ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) is adjacent at (2,4) — vectors block scan when adjacent. Must move away first. Enemy Bastion at (2,2) is unscanned and in range once I reposition. Move south to (3,2), then scan enemy Bastion to reveal their strategy.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (3,2). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemies. Move away to (5,2) to create distance and enable precision_shot next turn while maintaining range on both enemies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent. Bastion N at (2,3), Watcher E at (3,2). Fortified gives 50% dmg reduction if I don't move. Orders say hold line and attack adjacent enemies. Attack Bastion first (likely other sentinel/tank), stay fortified.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) N ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) at (2,4) is directly north and has higher speed - major flanking threat. Enemy Bastion at (2,2) is south. Orders say shield_wall facing enemy cluster and turn to face biggest threat if flanked. Specter is the bigger threat due to mobility. Move to (1,3) to reposition toward ally Watcher, then shield_wall facing north to protect against Veil.
  State: Bastion 9/10, Veil 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 8/10, Watcher 6/8 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 4 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(1,3) ✓
  💭 Bastion is 2 tiles away, facing W. I can reach (2,3) which is behind and adjacent to Bastion. This is the perfect breach opportunity - move behind Bastion and breach to take control of their sentinel, forcing them to waste their turn or attack their own team.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(1,3) ✓
  💭 Longshot just hit me with precision_shot. I need to reposition away from their line of fire while staying useful. Veil's breach failed (on cooldown), so they're less threatening this turn. I should move to (4,3) to get out of Longshot's direct line and maintain range on all enemies, then recalibrate my allied Bastion to help them be more effective on the front line.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is in range at (4,3). I can precision_shot for 2dmg without moving first. Stay at (5,2) to maintain positioning and deliver maximum damage.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion at (1,3) is 2 tiles away, approaching from west. Moving to (1,2) puts me adjacent to intercept and protects Veil at (2,3). Will attack Bastion next turn when adjacent.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 Watcher at (4,3) is wounded and needs protection. Longshot at (5,2) is the biggest threat with ranged attacks. I should position myself at (3,3) to block the eastern approach and use shield_wall facing E to protect Watcher from Longshot's line of fire. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Watcher and directly between them and Longshot.
  State: Bastion 9/10, Veil 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 8/10, Watcher 4/8 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 5 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(3,3) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Bastion at (2,3) and adjacent. Watcher is wounded at (4,3). I'll shadow_strike Bastion to damage while keeping cloak, then move to (4,2) behind Watcher to set up next turn's kill.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) is adjacent at (4,2) - this blocks my scan ability. Longshot just hit me with precision_shot. I need to escape the specter's melee range and reposition to scan safely. Moving north to (4,4) or (4,5) creates distance from all threats. Then recalibrate my ally Bastion at (3,3) to boost their effectiveness.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 Watcher is wounded and in range at distance 4. Moving closer to (5,3) brings distance to 2, allowing precision_shot with full 2dmg to finish the wounded enemy.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) E ✓
  💭 Watcher at (4,5) is wounded and needs protection. Longshot at (5,3) is only 2 tiles away and can shoot Watcher. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Watcher and between Longshot and Watcher. Then shield_wall facing East blocks Longshot's line of fire from that direction.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion at (4,4) and Watcher at (4,5) are both out of range. I need to advance to close distance while maintaining tank position. Moving to (3,2) advances toward enemies while staying between them and my backline. Will use shield_wall facing North to protect against incoming attacks from that direction.
  State: Bastion 9/10, Veil 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 7/10, Watcher 3/8 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bastion at (4,4) is 2 tiles away and facing N. I can reach (4,3) which is behind and adjacent - perfect for shadow_strike while maintaining cloak. This keeps me invisible and deals damage.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(4,5) ✓
  💭 Both wounded enemies in range. Bastion at (4,4) is closer. Will precision_shot Bastion first to eliminate, then precision_shot Watcher to finish second wounded target.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP and critically wounded. Longshot just shot me and will likely finish me next turn. I need to break line of sight or get protection. Moving to (3,5) puts me behind my ally Bastion at (4,4) and breaks LOS from Longshot at (5,3). Then recalibrate my Bastion ally to help them be more effective at protecting me.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Enemies approaching from north. Move to (3,3) to close distance and position between allies and threats. Use shield_wall facing north to protect Veil and Longshot from incoming attacks.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) E ✓
  💭 Watcher at (3,5) is critical. I need to shield_wall facing east to block Longshot at (5,3) from shooting Watcher. Moving to (3,4) puts me adjacent to Watcher and allows me to shield_wall east.
  State: Bastion 9/10, Veil 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 5/10, Watcher 1/8 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 7 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 Watcher is critical HP at (3,5). I can reach behind tile (4,5) in 1 move and finish with shadow_strike (keeps cloak). This secures the kill without exposing me.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion at (3,4) is wounded and in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot will deal full 2 damage. This should finish off the wounded enemy. No need to move since I have clear line of sight and range.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack to eliminate the wounded enemy, then hold position to maintain fortify bonus.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) S ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. The cluster is to the south/southeast (Bastion at 3,3, Longshot at 5,3). I'll shield_wall facing south to protect against Bastion and the cluster, then attack Bastion since it's in melee range.
  State: Bastion 8/10, Veil 5/5, Longshot 4/4, Bastion 3/10 | Dead: Marksman, Watcher
