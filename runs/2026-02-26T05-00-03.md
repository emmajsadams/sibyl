## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Weaver** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
### Opponent
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Grid** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(5,1) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1, tip says to cloak now. All enemies are out of range and too far to engage this turn. Grid is the closest at dist 4. I'll cloak first, then advance toward Grid at (4,4) — moving to (5,4) gets me closer while staying on the flank. This sets up a breach or shadow_strike next turn.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then advance toward enemies. Weaver at (3,0) is the priority target (vector denial ability). Move south toward center to close distance while cloaked.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 6, out of my range 2. No targets in range this turn. Orders say maintain distance. I'll advance slightly toward the enemy to get into range next turn, moving to (3,4) which keeps me near allies and positioned to engage.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,4) ✗ Cannot use precision_shot — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Grid is 3 tiles away at (4,4), in range for precision_shot. Marksman is 4 tiles away, out of range. I should move to (4,3) to get closer and bring Marksman into range, but that puts me adjacent to Grid (denial zone). Instead, move to (5,2) to reposition for better angles while staying out of Grid's denial range. From (5,2), Grid is still 3 tiles away (dist from 5,2 to 4,4 = sqrt(1+4)~2.2, actually dist=|5-4|+|2-4|=3), so still in range. Better: stay and shoot Grid now — dist=3, within precision_shot range of 2? Wait, range ≤2 tiles means max distance 2. Grid is dist=3, so OUT of precision_shot range. Need to move closer. Move to (4,3) would be adjacent to Grid — blocked. Move to (3,2): dist to Grid = |3-4|+|2-4|=3, still out of range. Move to (4,2): dist to Grid = |4-4|+|2-4|=2, in range! But is (4,2) adjacent to Grid at (4,4)? No, dist=2, not adjacent. Take the shot from (4,2) after moving.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Enemy Marksman is adjacent at (4,3) — within attack range. I can't place a trap while adjacent to an enemy Vector, but I'm not adjacent to Weaver so trap is available. However, the Marksman is right there and attacking costs nothing special. I should attack the Marksman for 1 damage, then move to (5,4) to reposition slightly while staying near ally Marksman at (3,4). Or better: move first to (4,5) to get distance, then place a trap on (4,4) or (4,3) to punish the Marksman if they advance. Actually, enemy Marksman is at dist=1 — I can attack directly. Let me attack first, then move to (5,4) to stay in support range of ally Marksman while getting slightly out of the enemy Marksman's immediate reach.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at (3,4) and (4,4) moving south toward us. I should move north to close distance while placing a trap on a likely approach path. Enemies are 4-5 tiles away. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer while staying safe. Then place a trap at (3,3) — directly between me and the enemy Marksman, a natural chokepoint they'll likely walk through.
  State: Marksman 3/4, Veil 4/4, Weaver 9/9, Marksman 4/4, Wraith 4/4, Grid 9/9

### Turn 2 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → breach(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and adjacent to Grid (DENIAL zone blocks abilities). I need to move away from Grid first to use breach. The priority target is the enemy Marksman (damage dealer). I can move to (3,5) which is directly behind the Marksman (facing S, behind tile is (3,5)), then breach them. Moving to (3,5) gets me behind Marksman and away from Grid's denial zone.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — need to use it now. Two breach targets available: Marksman at (4,3) with behind tile at (4,2), and Weaver at (3,2) with behind tile at (3,1). Weaver is a vector so breach would be blocked if adjacent (denial range). However, I can move to (3,1) which is BEHIND Weaver at (3,2) and adjacent — but Weaver denial only blocks cloak/breach when I'm adjacent to a Vector enemy. So breach on Weaver is blocked. Better target: move to (4,2) which is behind Marksman, then breach them. (4,2) is reachable (dist=2 from current pos (2,3): path through (3,3) or (3,2)... wait, valid moves include [3,3] and [4,2]? Check: valid tiles include [3,3] and [5,3] but not [4,2] explicitly. Valid moves list: [4,2] — yes it's there! Move to (4,2), then breach Marksman at (4,3). This uses breach while cloaked and behind enemy.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → suppressing_fire(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid's denial zone, blocking precision_shot. Wraith is at (4,2) dist=1, Grid at (4,4) dist=1. I need to escape the denial zone to use precision_shot. Moving to (5,3) breaks adjacency with Grid at (4,4) and puts me dist=2 from Marksman at (3,4) — but let me check: from (5,3), Marksman at (3,4) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, not in range 2. Move to (5,4): Marksman at (3,4) dist=sqrt(4+0)=2, in range. From (5,4) I'm not adjacent to Grid(4,4)... wait, (5,4) is adjacent to (4,4) diagonally — need to check if that counts. Grid is at (4,4), I'd be at (5,4), that's 1 tile away horizontally — still adjacent! Try (5,3): Grid(4,4) dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4 diagonal — likely not adjacent in grid terms. Actually adjacent typically means orthogonal. (5,3) vs Grid(4,4): dx=1, dy=1 — diagonal, not orthogonal adjacent. So (5,3) breaks denial. From (5,3), Marksman(3,4): dx=2, dy=1 — dist=3, out of range 2. From (5,4), Grid(4,4): dx=1, dy=0 — still orthogonally adjacent, still in denial. Best: move to (5,3) to escape denial, then basic attack Wraith(4,2) at dist=sqrt(1+1) — not adjacent. Or suppressing_fire on Wraith from (5,3): Wraith at (4,2), dist from (5,3) = sqrt(1+1)~1.4, within range 2. Suppressing_fire slows rushers. Let's move to (5,3) then suppressing_fire targeting Wraith at (4,2).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move south away from allies toward map edge. I'm at (3,4). Valid southern moves include (3,3) and (2,3) or (2,4). South means decreasing y. (3,3) moves me one south, and from there I could move again but it's a single move action. Wait — I have mv2, so I can move up to 2 tiles. (2,3) is 2 tiles away and moves me south-west. But directly south would be (3,2) — let me check valid tiles. Valid tiles listed: [2,3],[3,3] are the southward options directly. (3,3) is 1 south, and (2,3) is diagonal-ish. I don't see (3,2) in valid moves — Weaver is at (3,2) blocking it. So max south I can go is (3,3). I'll move to (3,3) and wait as second action.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Two enemies in range: Marksman at (5,3) and Veil at (3,5). Orders say to place traps on likely enemy movement tiles. Weaver is at (3,2) dist=3, so I must not move adjacent to it. I'm at (4,4). Veil is at (3,5) moving toward us likely. If I move to (4,5), I'd be adjacent to Veil — bad. If I move to (5,4), that puts me between Marksman and Veil, which could be useful for pulse but risky. Best play: place a trap on (4,3) — a tile between me and Weaver/Marksman that enemies may move through. Then move to (5,4) to apply Denial pressure on Marksman at (5,3) who is adjacent. Wait — if I move to (5,4), Marksman is at (5,3) which is adjacent, so my Denial passive blocks some of their abilities. But I need to check Weaver distance — from (5,4), Weaver at (3,2) is dist=4, safe. Trap at (4,3) covers the approach path from Marksman/Weaver. This is the best play.
- **Weaver** (vector): pulse(3,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Two enemies adjacent: Marksman at (3,3) and Wraith at (4,2). Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - both enemies are within 1 tile of my current position (3,2). No allies are adjacent (nearest ally Marksman is at (5,3), distance 2+). Pulse now for 1dmg to both enemies, then move to (4,3) to block Marksman's path and stay near ally Marksman at (5,3) for support. Trap blocked since enemies are adjacent.
  State: Marksman 3/4, Veil 4/4, Weaver 8/9, Marksman 2/4, Wraith 2/4, Grid 9/9

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Marksman is wounded and I'm behind them — move to (3,4) to get adjacent from behind, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. Breach is on cooldown so shadow_strike is the right play here. This keeps me invisible and eliminates the priority target.
- **Wraith** (specter): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed (movement=1), adjacent to Weaver who has denial active blocking special abilities. I'm already behind Weaver (I'm at 4,2, Weaver faces N, behind tile is 4,2). Denial blocks cloak/breach but NOT basic attack. I have 2HP so I need to deal damage fast. Attack the Weaver adjacent to me - it's the best option since breach is blocked by denial anyway. After attacking, I can't move far due to suppression.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move south away from allies toward map edge. I'm at (3,3), valid southern moves include (3,2) and (3,1). Moving to (3,1) gets me furthest south in one turn using both movement steps. I'm at 1HP and adjacent to denial zone, so avoiding abilities. Just move south.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(5,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid's denial zone, so precision_shot is blocked. Wraith is wounded and adjacent at (5,2) - I can basic attack it. But first I should move away from Grid to escape denial and potentially enable precision_shot. Moving to (4,2) breaks adjacency with Grid and keeps distance from Wraith. From (4,2) I can check if precision_shot works on Wraith at dist=2. Actually, moving to (4,2) puts me at dist=1 from Wraith still (diagonal? no, Manhattan: |4-5|+|2-2|=1). Let me try (4,4) - dist to Grid=(1,0)=1, still adjacent. (5,1): dist to Grid=3, dist to Wraith=1 - still adjacent to Wraith but away from Grid denial. Best: move to (4,2) breaks Grid adjacency (dist=2+2=... wait Grid is at (5,4), dist from (4,2)=|4-5|+|2-4|=3, not adjacent). From (4,2), Wraith at (5,2) is dist=1 still adjacent - basic attack only. Alternatively move to (5,1): Grid at (5,4) dist=3, Wraith at (5,2) dist=1 still adjacent. I should move away from Grid first, then basic attack Wraith who is wounded - finishing them is priority. Move to (4,2) escapes Grid denial, then basic attack Wraith at (5,2) dist=1.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is at (3,4) distance 2 — within trap range. Weaver is at (4,3) distance 2 — adjacent to (4,4) which is a valid move tile. I should avoid moving to (4,4) as that would put me adjacent to Weaver and block my abilities. I'll place a trap on (4,4) — a tile enemies are likely to move through (between Weaver and my position), and it's within my range of 2. I cannot use trap if adjacent to enemy Vector, but Weaver is at distance 2 so I'm not adjacent. After placing trap, I'll stay put or move to (5,5) to maintain distance from Weaver while keeping trap coverage.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(5,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical and within range 2 from my current position. I can attack Wraith directly. Then place a trap on a likely escape route — Wraith at (5,2) facing E might move to (5,1) or stay. Enemy Marksman at (3,1) is also critical. I should place a trap at (4,2) or (3,2) to intercept Marksman movement north. Grid is at (5,5) — not adjacent so denial doesn't affect me. Attack Wraith first (range 2 is valid for attack? No — attack is adjacent only, range=adjacent). So I cannot attack Wraith from (4,3). Trap range is ≤2 tiles. I can place trap at (5,2) but Wraith is there. Place trap at (4,2) — ally Marksman is there, invalid. Try (3,2) to catch enemy Marksman moving north, or (5,3) to catch Wraith if they move. Place trap at (5,3) to intercept Wraith movement, then move to (5,3)? No — can't trap where I'm standing. Move to (4,4) to stay safe and place trap at (5,3) to intercept Wraith/Grid movement.
  State: Marksman 3/4, Veil 4/4, Weaver 6/9, Marksman 1/4, Wraith 1/4, Grid 9/9

### Turn 4 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(3,1) ✓
  💭 Enemy Marksman is critical HP at (3,1) facing S — behind tile is (3,2), reachable in 1 move from my position at (3,4). I can move to (3,2) to get directly behind them, then use breach to take control of the critical Marksman. This is high value: breach on a critical striker removes their threat and turns them against their team. Grid is 3 tiles away at (5,5) so I need to avoid (4,4) area to not trigger denial. Moving to (3,2) keeps me away from Grid's adjacent denial range.
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,2) with only 1HP — extremely fragile. Enemy Marksman is adjacent at (4,2) facing S. I need to use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked (shadow_strike doesn't break cloak). But wait — I'm not cloaked right now (no cloak status shown). At 1HP I can't afford to take any hits. The Marksman is adjacent and healthy. I should shadow_strike the Marksman for 1 damage (it's adjacent), then move to (4,3) which puts me behind the Marksman — setting up a breach next turn if I survive. Actually, shadow_strike requires cloak to keep cloak... but I'm not cloaked. I should use shadow_strike anyway for 1 damage on the adjacent Marksman, then move to safety. (4,3) is behind Marksman and also behind Weaver — but moving there puts me 3 tiles from Weaver which is exactly the denial boundary. Better to shadow_strike first then retreat to (5,3) or (5,1) to avoid being targeted.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/4) and orders say to move toward allied Marksman at (4,2). Wait - the allied Marksman is at (4,2) but the enemies include a Marksman (striker, enemy) at (4,2) - the orders seem contradictory. The enemy Marksman at (4,2) is wounded and in range. Veil (specter, enemy) is adjacent at (3,2). I should not use precision_shot since Veil is adjacent (blocked). I can use suppressing_fire or attack. Orders say attack enemy Wraith or Grid - but I see no Wraith listed as enemy; Wraith is an ally. Grid is an ally too. The orders seem confused. Given my critical HP, I should prioritize damage output. Enemy Marksman at (4,2) is wounded - finishing them is best. I'll move to (4,1) to get adjacent to enemy Marksman, then attack for 1dmg to potentially finish them. Or stay and use suppressing_fire on Marksman at (4,2) from current position (dist=2, in range) to deal 1dmg to the line. Suppressing_fire from (3,1) targeting (4,2) direction E would hit (4,2) and (5,2). That deals 1dmg to Marksman and slows them. Better: move to (4,1) first, then attack Marksman at (4,2) adjacent for 1dmg.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 1HP, critical condition. Marksman is adjacent at (4,1) - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Wraith is at (5,1) dist=2, critical. I need to move first to get distance from Marksman to enable precision_shot. Move to (3,1) to get away from Marksman at (4,1) - that puts me dist=2 from Marksman and dist=3 from Wraith. Actually, move to (3,3) to retreat - dist from Marksman becomes ~2, enabling precision_shot on Marksman to finish them. Or move to (4,3) - dist from Marksman=2, can then use precision_shot on Marksman. (4,3) keeps me in range of Marksman at dist=2 and I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg - Marksman is critical so 1dmg should kill. Let me go (4,3) then precision_shot Marksman.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 Grid is at (5,5) distance 2 — I must not move adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. Wraith is at (5,1) critical and moving toward us. Trap at (5,3) already placed. I should place another trap on a likely enemy movement path. Wraith at (5,1) heading N will likely move through (5,2) or (4,2). I can place a trap at (4,2) from my current position (4,4) — that's within range 2. I should move first to get better positioning, but I must stay away from Grid at (5,5). Moving to (3,4) keeps distance from Grid and lets me trap (4,2) which is in Wraith's path.
- **Grid** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✗ Cannot use trap — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 All enemies are out of range. Marksman is at (4,3) and Weaver at (3,4) — both 3 tiles away. I should move closer while placing a trap on a likely enemy path. Marksman is critical and moving north, likely to push toward me. If I move to (4,4), I'm 1 tile from Marksman's current position and can trap (4,3) or (5,3) to catch their advance. But Weaver is at (3,4) — moving to (4,4) puts me 2 tiles from Weaver, safe from denial. I'll move to (4,4) and trap (4,3) where Marksman currently stands or will pass through.
  State: Marksman 1/4, Veil 4/4, Weaver 6/9, Wraith 1/4, Grid 9/9 | Dead: Marksman

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with only 1HP — extremely vulnerable. Marksman is at (4,3) facing N, critical HP. Position (4,2) is directly behind Marksman and reachable (dist=1 from Marksman, and (4,2) is in my valid moves). I can move to (4,2) to get behind Marksman, then use breach to make them obey me next turn — or shadow_strike for 1 damage to finish them. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I have it, but I'm not cloaked. At 1HP, killing Marksman is top priority. Move to (4,2) — that's adjacent to Marksman and behind them. Then shadow_strike won't finish a 'critical' enemy unless they're at 1HP... they are critical so likely low HP. Use shadow_strike to avoid breaking cloak, but I'm not cloaked. Use regular attack or shadow_strike — shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak (irrelevant here). I'll move to (4,2) and shadow_strike Marksman to try to finish them.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (4,2) and critical — one hit kills. I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't help preserve cloak. Use shadow_strike to finish Wraith without breaking any cloak state, staying safe.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✗ Out of range (max 2)
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid (enemy vector) at (4,4), so my DENIAL zone is suppressing their abilities too, but trap is blocked for me. I should move away from Grid to escape their denial zone, then place a trap. Moving to (2,4) puts me 2 tiles from Grid, breaking adjacency. Then I can place a trap at (4,3) near the existing trap at (5,3) to create a trap corridor enemies must pass through.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Weaver is at (2,4), 2 tiles west. I can't trap adjacent to an enemy vector, but Weaver is 2 tiles away so trap is available. Veil(specter) is at (3,2) moving south — likely to pass through (3,3) or (3,4). I should place a trap on (3,3) to intercept Veil's likely path southward. I'll move to (3,4) first to get closer and better positioning, then trap (3,3) to intercept Veil. But wait — if I move to (3,4) I'd be adjacent to Weaver at (2,4), which would block my trap ability. Better to trap first from current position (4,4), targeting (3,3) which is within range 2, then move.
  State: Veil 4/4, Weaver 6/9, Grid 9/9 | Dead: Marksman, Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). I'm cloaked and need to get behind Grid to use shadow_strike. Grid is at (4,3) facing S, behind tile is (4,4). I can move to (4,4) which is adjacent and behind Grid, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,3) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,3) heading S, so likely to move toward (4,1) or (4,2). There's already a trap at (5,3). I should place a trap on a tile Grid is likely to pass through. Moving to (3,4) puts me closer but still 2 tiles from Grid (dist would be ~2), which risks denial. Better to stay at (2,4) or move to (3,4) to place trap at (4,3) or (3,3). Grid is at dist=3 currently — if I move to (3,4), dist to Grid becomes sqrt((4-3)^2+(3-4)^2)=sqrt(2)≈1.4, which is adjacent — that would trigger denial and block my trap. Stay at current position or move to (3,3) to place trap at (4,3) which is exactly range 2 from (2,4): dist=sqrt(4+1)=2.24 — just over range. From (2,4), trap range is ≤2 tiles. Target (3,3) is dist sqrt(1+1)=1.41 ✓. Target (4,4) is dist 2 ✓. Grid heading S from (4,3) might move to (4,2) or (4,1). Place trap at (4,4) — Grid is at (4,3) heading S so unlikely. Better: place trap at (3,3) which is a natural path. From (2,4), (3,3) is within range 2. This intercepts Grid if it moves west.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,4) - perfect pulse target. Only one enemy adjacent so pulse does 1dmg. Better to attack directly for 1dmg. There's already a trap at (3,3). I should place a trap on a tile Veil might retreat to, or use pulse/attack on Veil. Veil is specter so likely has cloak - my Denial passive blocks cloak while adjacent, which is great. Attack Veil for 1dmg, then place trap at (4,5) to cut off northern escape.
  State: Veil 3/4, Weaver 6/9, Grid 8/9 | Dead: Marksman, Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 7 — player
- **Veil** (specter): attack(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is adjacent at (4,3), I'm behind it (it faces S, I'm at (4,4) which is behind). Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). I'm in Grid's denial zone so abilities may be blocked, but basic attack works. Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best option: attack Grid directly since I'm adjacent and behind it. I can't use breach, can't cloak safely here. Just attack Grid to deal damage.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(3,4) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,3) heading S, likely moving toward (4,2) or (4,1). Existing traps at (5,3) and (3,3) already cover flanks. I should move closer to place a trap on Grid's likely path. Moving to (3,4) gets me in range to trap (3,2) or (4,2) - tiles Grid would pass through heading south. Move to (3,4) then trap (3,2) to catch Grid moving south.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,4) — pulse will hit them for 1dmg. Weaver is at (3,4), dist 2, so outside pulse range but within attack range. I should pulse first to hit Veil, then consider positioning. Moving to (5,4) after pulse keeps me in range of Veil while moving away from Weaver's denial zone. Actually, pulse hits all within 1 tile — Veil at dist 1 gets hit. Weaver at dist 2 does not. After pulse, I can move to (5,4) to stay on Veil's flank and away from Weaver.
  State: Veil 2/4, Weaver 6/9, Grid 7/9 | Dead: Marksman, Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Grid with DENIAL active, so cloak/breach are blocked. I have 2HP, Grid is healthy. Breach is unavailable (limit reached). Best play: move to (5,3) which is behind Grid (facing N), then shadow_strike from behind for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Moving to (5,3) first puts me in the behind tile and shadow_strike keeps cloak active.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,4), 2 tiles away. I'm at (3,4). Veil is at (5,3) which already has a trap on it - dangerous for my wounded ally. I need to place traps on tiles Grid is likely to move through. Grid faces N, so likely moving to (5,5) or (4,4). I can trap (4,4) or (4,3) to block Grid's approach paths. I should NOT move adjacent to Grid (would be at distance 1) which would trigger denial. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to Grid at (5,4) - avoid that. I'll stay at (3,4) and place a trap at (4,4) which is a key chokepoint Grid would use to approach, then place another trap or wait. Actually I can only use one ability per turn. Place trap at (4,4) - it's in range (≤2 tiles from me at 3,4), and it's a likely path for Grid moving west toward our position.
- **Grid** (vector): pulse(5,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (5,3) and wounded — pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will damage Veil. I'm at (5,4), Veil is at (5,3) which is distance 1, so pulse will hit them. After pulse, I should move away from Veil to avoid being adjacent next turn, or place a trap. Actually, let me pulse first to damage the wounded Veil (could finish them), then move to (4,5) to place a trap on a likely movement corridor — but wait, (4,5) has a trap already. Move to (4,4) or (4,3) instead. Actually I should pulse first while Veil is adjacent, then reposition. Moving to (4,4) puts me away from Veil and I could place a trap elsewhere next turn.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 1HP, cloaked. Grid is at (4,4) wounded, facing W. I'm behind Grid since I'm to the east. Moving to (5,4) puts me adjacent and behind Grid. Then shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage - if Grid is wounded that may finish them. (5,4) is a valid move tile. No traps at (5,4).
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,4) wounded and moving west toward me. I need to place a trap on a tile they're likely to move through. (3,4) is directly between us and a likely path for Grid moving west. I'm at (2,4) and Grid is 2 tiles away - I must NOT move adjacent to Grid or my trap ability gets blocked. I can place a trap at (3,4) from my current position (dist=2, within trap range) without moving. Then I'll move to (2,3) to reposition and avoid being on the same row as Grid if they advance.
- **Grid** (vector): attack(5,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (5,4) and critical - attack to finish them off. Then move west to (3,4) to keep distance from Weaver while staying away from trap at (4,5).

### Turn 10 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,4), wounded, facing W. Traps already at (3,3) and (3,2) blocking southern escape. Grid moving W might go to (2,4) or (1,4). I should trap (2,4) to catch that movement. I'm at (2,3), trap range is ≤2 tiles, (2,4) is 1 tile away and valid. Place trap at (2,4) first, then move to (1,3) to stay out of Grid's denial range while maintaining pressure.
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 3HP, low health. Weaver is at (1,3) moving west - likely heading further west or staying put. I have traps at (3,3) and (4,5) already placed. I should place a new trap to control the area. Weaver is 3 tiles away so I'm not adjacent - trap placement is valid. Moving to (2,4) would put me closer but still safe from denial range. I'll place a trap at (2,3) to cut off Weaver's likely movement paths, then move to a safer position. Actually, let me trap (2,4) or (2,3) to intercept Weaver. I'll move first to (2,5) to get better positioning while staying away from the existing trap at (3,3), then place a trap at (2,3) which is along Weaver's likely path.
  State: Weaver 6/9, Grid 3/9 | Dead: Marksman, Veil, Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 11 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (2,5) heading North, wounded. Trap at (2,4) already covers its likely path. I should place a trap at (1,5) or (2,3) to intercept movement. My valid moves include (2,4) but that has a trap. Moving to (1,4) keeps me safe and lets me place a trap at (2,4)... wait, (2,4) already has a trap. Grid moving North from (2,5) might go to (2,3) or (1,5). I'll move to (1,4) and place a trap at (2,3) to cut off escape routes southward.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) with 3HP, Weaver is at (1,4) distance 2. I need to avoid getting adjacent to Weaver or my trap ability gets blocked. Valid moves include (3,5) and (3,4) which keep distance. Traps at (3,3), (4,5), (2,3) already placed. I should place a new trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (3,5) keeps distance from Weaver and lets me trap (3,4) or another approach tile. Weaver is moving north, so (2,4) or (3,4) are likely paths. I'll move to (3,5) first, then trap (3,4) to block Weaver's northward advance.
  State: Weaver 6/9, Grid 3/9 | Dead: Marksman, Veil, Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 12 — player
- **Grid** (vector): move(2,5) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 3HP, Weaver is at (1,4) heading North. I have traps at (3,3), (4,5), (2,3), (3,4) already placed. Weaver moving North from (1,4) would go to (1,5) or (2,5). I should place a trap on (2,5) or (1,5) to intercept. I can't place traps when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Weaver is 3 tiles away so I'm fine. Move to (2,5) to place a trap there, or place trap directly at (2,4) which is on Weaver's likely path northward. Valid moves include (2,5) and (2,4). I'll move to (2,5) first to stay safe and place a trap at (2,4) which is directly in Weaver's northward path.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(1,5) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (2,5) moving W, wounded. I'm at (1,4). Trap at (2,4) already exists. Grid moving W from (2,5) might go to (1,5) or (0,5). I should place a trap at (1,5) to intercept that path. I need to stay out of adjacent range (dist>1) to keep my trap ability unblocked. Moving to (0,5) would put me adjacent to Grid if it moves to (1,5), risky. Stay at (1,4) or move to (0,3) to maintain distance. Place trap at (1,5) — Grid's likely westward path — from current position (1,4), that's within range 2. Then move away to avoid being caught.
  State: Weaver 6/9, Grid 3/9 | Dead: Marksman, Veil, Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 13 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): move(1,4) ✓ → trap(0,5) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (2,5) moving W, so likely heading toward (1,5) or (0,5). I see trap already at (1,5) which covers that path. Grid moving W could also go to (1,5)→(0,5). I should move to intercept and place traps on likely paths. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer while (2,3) is already trapped. I can place a trap at (0,5) or (1,4) to cover Grid's westward movement path. Let me move to (1,4) to get closer and place a trap at (0,5) which Grid might pass through moving west.
- **Grid** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(1,5) ✓
  💭 At 3/9 HP I need to be careful. Weaver is at (1,4) facing North, likely to move toward (1,5) or (2,4). There are already traps at (2,4) and (2,3). I should move to (3,5) to stay at safe distance from Weaver (avoid adjacency to keep my abilities unblocked), then place a trap at (1,5) which Weaver is likely to step on moving north.
  State: Weaver 6/9, Grid 3/9 | Dead: Marksman, Veil, Marksman, Wraith

### Turn 14 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(2,5) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (3,5) moving east, wounded. Many traps already placed. (1,5) and (0,5) are trapped. I'm at (1,4). Grid is 3 tiles away — need to stay out of denial range. Valid moves include (3,4) which would put me adjacent to Grid — avoid that. I should place a trap on a likely enemy path. Grid is at (3,5) moving east, so (4,5) or (2,5) could be movement targets. (2,5) is reachable for trap placement from current position (dist=2, within range 2). That would cut off Grid's westward movement. Let me move to (1,3) first to reposition, then trap (2,5) — wait, I can trap from current position if (2,5) is within range 2. Dist from (1,4) to (2,5) = sqrt(1+1) ≈ 1.4, yes within range 2. Place trap at (2,5) to block Grid's path, then move to (1,3) to stay safe.
- **Grid** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 3HP, facing east. Weaver is at (1,3) heading south, distance 4. There are already traps at (3,3), (4,5), (2,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,5). Weaver is moving south from (1,3), so could move to (1,2) or (1,1). I need to place traps in likely enemy paths. Valid moves include (2,5) and (2,4) but (2,4) already has a trap. I should move closer and place a trap on a tile Weaver might pass through. Moving to (2,5) gets me closer while staying safe. From (2,5) I can trap a tile further south toward Weaver's path. But wait - (1,5) already has a trap. Let me think about where Weaver heading south might go next. From (1,3) going south: (1,2), (1,1). I can't reach those to trap them easily. I could move to (2,4) but there's already a trap there. Let me move to (1,5) - wait that has a trap too. Move to (2,5) and trap (2,3) - already trapped. I'll move to (2,5) and trap (1,3) which is Weaver's current position (they'll leave it) or try (2,2) which is reachable at range 2 from (2,5) - dist would be 3, too far. From (2,5), range 2: can reach (2,3) already trapped, (1,5) already trapped. Let me move to (3,4) - wait that's already trapped. Move to (4,4) and trap (4,3) to create a new trap zone.

### Turn 15 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): move(2,2) ✓ → trap(3,1) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (4,4) moving south. Traps already cover (3,3), (3,2), (2,4), (2,3) - lots of southern approach blocked. I should move east to extend trap coverage toward Grid's likely movement path. Moving to (2,2) then placing a trap at (3,2) is already covered. Let me move to (1,4) and place a trap at (2,4) - wait, (2,4) already trapped. I'll move to (2,2) and place trap at (3,2) - also covered. Best option: move to (1,2) and place trap at (2,2) to fill gap, or move toward (2,2) directly. Actually valid moves include (2,2) and (3,3) but (3,3) is already trapped. Move to (2,2) and place trap at (3,2) - already trapped. Move to (1,4) and trap (2,4) - already trapped. Move to (2,2) and place trap at (2,1) to extend southern coverage. That's a new tile not in trap list.
- **Grid** (vector): move(5,5) ✓ → trap(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 3HP, enemy Weaver at (2,2) distance 4. Many traps already placed. Valid moves include (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). I should move toward Weaver to pressure them while placing a trap on a likely path. Moving to (3,5) then placing trap - but (3,4) already has a trap. Moving to (5,3) to reposition, then place a trap at (5,4) to deny that area. Actually, Weaver is moving south from (2,2). Key approach tiles would be (3,3) already trapped, (2,3) trapped, (3,4) trapped. Let me move closer - to (3,5) to approach, then place trap at (3,3)... already trapped. Move to (5,5) to stay safe and place trap at (5,4) to cover retreat paths.

### Turn 16 — player
- **Grid** (vector): move(5,4) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 At 3/9 HP I need to be cautious. Weaver is at (2,2) distance 6, out of range. Trap at (4,5) already exists. Valid moves are [3,5],[4,4],[4,5],[5,3],[5,4]. I should move toward the enemy to pressure while placing traps on likely approach paths. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer while I can try to trap (3,5) which is a likely corridor. However (4,5) already has a trap. Let me move to (5,3) to get closer and place a trap on (4,4) or (3,3) - but (3,3) already has a trap. I'll move to (5,4) and place a trap at (4,4) which is an open approach tile.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,2) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,4) moving south, dist=5, out of range. Many traps already placed. Valid moves include (4,2) which gets me closer to Grid's likely path. I'm blocked from placing traps at adjacent tiles due to denial if enemy is adjacent, but Grid is far away. I should advance toward Grid and place a trap on a likely path tile. Grid moving south from (5,4) might pass through (5,3) - already trapped. (4,2) is a valid move tile. From (4,2) I could trap (4,1) or (5,2) to cut off Grid's movement south/west. Move to (4,2) then trap (5,2) to block Grid's westward escape route.

- **Grid** (vector): trap(5,2) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,4) with 3HP, Weaver is at (4,2) heading East at distance 3. Many traps already placed. I need to avoid getting adjacent to Weaver (denial blocks trap). Valid moves include (5,5), (5,3), (5,2), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,4). Weaver is moving East from (4,2), likely heading to (5,2) or continuing East. I should place a trap at (5,2) or (5,3) to intercept. I can move to (5,3) and then place a trap at (5,2) to catch Weaver if they move north-east. Or stay put and trap (5,3) since Weaver at (4,2) heading East might go to (5,2) then (5,3). Let me trap (5,2) from current position - it's within range 2. Distance from (5,4) to (5,2) is 2, so it's within trap range. I'll trap (5,2) to catch Weaver moving east, then move to (5,5) to stay safe and away from Weaver.
- **Weaver** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(5,4) ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,5) moving south. There's already a trap at (5,2) and (5,3) blocking the direct south path. Grid will likely try to move west or diagonally to avoid traps. I should place a trap at (4,4) to intercept westward movement, then move north to close distance while staying out of trap zones. Valid moves include (4,4) which is trap-free and on Grid's likely path.

### Turn 18 — player
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 3HP, Weaver is at (4,4) wounded and 2 tiles away. I need to place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Weaver is heading North, so tiles (4,5) and (3,5) are likely paths. (4,5) already has a trap. (3,5) is a valid move for me. I should place a trap on a likely enemy path. From my current position at (5,5), I can trap tiles within 2 range. Weaver moving North from (4,4) might go to (4,5) — already trapped. They might go to (3,5) or (5,5). I'll stay put and place a trap on (3,5) to block their movement path, then wait or move to safety.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,5), wounded, 2 tiles away. I'm at (4,4). Traps already at (5,4) and (5,3) blocking Grid's south escape. I should not move adjacent to Grid (would be blocked). I can place a trap to further restrict Grid's movement. Grid at (5,5) facing N - likely to move north or stay. I can trap (4,5) to cut off westward escape route. Then wait or reposition. Can't use trap if adjacent to enemy vector, but Grid is 2 tiles away so trap is allowed.

### Turn 19 — player
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(4,5) ✓ → move(3,undefined) ✗ Out of bounds
  💭 Grid is at (5,5) wounded and 2 tiles away. I'm at (4,4). Many traps already placed. (4,5) is a valid move and already has a trap there per the trap list - wait, (4,5) is listed as a trap tile. I need to place traps on tiles Grid might move through. Grid is at (5,5) heading N - but it's on the edge, so it might move W or S. (4,5) already trapped. I can't place trap while adjacent to enemy, but Grid is 2 tiles away so trap is not blocked. I should move to maintain distance and place a trap on a likely path. Grid might move to (4,5) or (5,4) - both already trapped! Or (4,4) my current position. I could move to (3,4) to stay safe and place a trap at (4,4) to cover my current tile which Grid might step on.
- **Grid** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 3HP, wounded. Weaver is at (4,4), dist=2, also wounded. I can't use trap if adjacent to an enemy Vector, but at dist=2 I'm safe to place traps. Valid moves are [3,5],[4,5],[5,3],[5,4]. (4,5) has a trap already. My orders say place traps on likely enemy movement paths. Weaver is at (4,4) heading N — likely to move to (4,5) or (3,4) or (3,5). (3,5) looks like a good trap target — it's a likely path. I should stay at current position or move to (5,4) to avoid (4,5) trap. Actually I'm at (5,5) already, trap range is ≤2 tiles. I can place a trap at (3,5) from here (dist=2, within range). Stay put and trap (3,5) to cut off Weaver's movement path.

  💭 I'm at (5,5) with 3HP, Weaver is at (4,4) wounded and 2 tiles away. Most tiles around me are already trapped. Valid moves are [3,5],[4,5],[5,3],[5,4] — but (4,5) has a trap. I can attack Weaver from range 2, but my ability is 'trap' (range ≤2) or 'pulse' (range 1 AoE). Weaver is at dist=2, so pulse won't reach. I can place a trap — but trap is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, and Weaver is a vector at dist=2 so not adjacent, trap should work. Weaver is wounded and at (4,4), likely to move N toward (4,5) which already has a trap, or W. I should place a trap at (5,4) to block escape routes, then wait or move to safety. Actually (3,5),(5,3),(5,4) are trap-free valid moves. Place trap at (5,4) to cover that corridor, then wait.
- **Weaver** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Grid is at (5,5), dist 2 to my north-east. Many traps already placed. I should trap a tile Grid might move through. Grid is wounded and moving north - (5,4) is already trapped. I can't place traps adjacent to enemy, but Grid is at dist 2 so I'm safe to trap. (4,3) or (5,3) are already trapped. Let me check open tiles near Grid's likely movement paths. (4,5) is trapped already. Moving to (3,4) to maintain safe distance while placing a trap on (4,5)... wait (4,5) is already trapped. I'll stay at (4,4) and place a trap on (3,5) which is unoccupied and on a likely movement path if Grid moves west.
