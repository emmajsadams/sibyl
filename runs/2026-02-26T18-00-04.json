Recalibrate requires adjacent target — Hawk is at (5,5), I'm at (4,5), dist=1, adjacent. That works. After recalibrate, I can't move+ability, but I can move then ability or ability then move. Plan: recalibrate Hawk first (boost their damage), then move toward Warden scan position. Move to (3,4) brings Warden to dist 3, in range — but I already used my ability.
