## Squads
### Player
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
### Opponent
- **Marksman** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(1,0) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move north to advance toward enemy lines while invisible. All enemies are 5-6 tiles away, so I need to close distance under cloak.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(0,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile
  💭 Round 1 — priority is to cloak immediately. Enemies are far (Longshot at dist 5, Warden at dist 7). I should cloak now and move toward Longshot to set up an assassination next turn. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer while staying off the main lane.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Longshot is at (2,1), dist=4 — need to close to range 2. Moving to (2,3) gets me dist=2 from Longshot, enabling precision_shot. Ally Warden is at (2,4) so I'll move to (3,4) to avoid stacking and get a clear angle.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is at (2,4), dist=3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles means dist≤2, so dist=3 is OUT of range). Need to close to dist≤2. Move to (2,3) puts me at dist=1 from Warden — well within range. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Fire on Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (2,3) — attack immediately. Then shield_wall facing South to protect allies from the enemy cluster ahead.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemies are 4-5 tiles away, out of range. I need to advance toward the front line to position between allies and enemies. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to the threat while staying on the front line. No enemies adjacent so no attack possible. I'll advance and wait.
  State: Ghost 5/5, Warden 10/10, Longshot 4/5, Warden 9/10, Marksman 5/5, Phantom 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining. I need to use it wisely. The Warden at (2,4) facing S has a behind tile at (2,5) which is reachable and adjacent. I can move to (2,5) to get behind the Warden, then use shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This is the ideal play - get behind, shadow_strike, maintain cloak.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining. No enemies in range and no reachable behind positions. Priority is Longshot at (2,3) — the enemy damage dealer. Move closer to get into position. Moving to (1,3) puts me 2 tiles from Longshot and 1 tile from the behind tile (2,2). Next turn I can move behind and shadow_strike or breach.
- **Longshot** (striker): suppressing_fire(1,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm flanked: enemy Warden at (2,4) distance 1 and enemy Phantom at (1,3) distance 1. Marksman at (3,4) distance 2. With enemies adjacent, precision_shot may be blocked by Phantom's Vector adjacency (if it has that ability). I have no wounded targets to prioritize. Best play: move to (3,3) to break adjacency with Phantom and maintain range on enemies, then use precision_shot on Marksman at (3,4) which is now distance 1 — clean shot, no movement penalty concern since I moved first but precision_shot does 1dmg if moved. Actually, suppressing_fire on the enemy Warden or Phantom rushing me could slow them. Phantom is a specter/rusher threat. Use suppressing_fire targeting (1,3) to slow Phantom, then move to (3,3) to escape the pincer. Wait — suppressing_fire does 1dmg in a 2-tile line from target. If I target Phantom at (1,3), the line goes from there... I need to specify direction for suppressing_fire. Actually direction is only for shield_wall. Let me re-read: suppressing_fire hits a 2-tile line from target. Best: move to (3,3) first to escape adjacency, then precision_shot Marksman at (3,4) for 1dmg (reduced since I moved). Or fire suppressing_fire at Warden to slow it. Given orders say suppress rushers, fire suppressing_fire at Phantom (1,3) to slow it, then move to (3,3).
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Longshot is adjacent at (3,3) - this blocks precision_shot due to Vector adjacency? No, that's Vector specifically. Longshot is a striker, not Vector. But Longshot is at dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles with LoS. Adjacent enemies don't block precision_shot for strikers - only Vector does. However, I'm at full HP with no wounded enemies to prioritize. Longshot is adjacent and healthy - I can use precision_shot on Longshot (dist=1, ≤2 range). But wait - if I moved this turn, precision_shot does only 1dmg. I haven't moved yet. If I shoot first with precision_shot on Longshot (2dmg), then move away to safety. Longshot at dist=1 is a threat. Ghost at dist=2 is also threatening. Shooting Longshot with precision_shot for 2dmg (no move penalty) is the best play, then retreat to (4,5) to increase distance from threats.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction. Longshot is wounded at (3,3) just north of me — I should shield_wall to protect them. Enemies are at dist 3-4, not adjacent. Moving would break fortify. Best play: shield_wall toward Phantom at (1,3) which is W/NW — direction N covers Longshot from threats coming from north. Actually, Phantom is to my northwest, Warden is northwest too. Longshot is at (3,3) directly north of me and wounded. I should shield_wall targeting Longshot in direction N to block incoming damage from northern threats, or W to block Phantom approach. Phantom at (1,3) is west-ish. I'll shield_wall targeting Longshot (3,3) direction W to block Phantom. Then wait to keep fortify.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → shield_wall(1,4) N ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (2,5) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% DR. Attack Ghost first, then shield_wall facing North to protect allies from the enemy cluster ahead.
  State: Ghost 4/5, Warden 10/10, Longshot 2/5, Warden 8/10, Marksman 5/5, Phantom 4/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(2,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,5) already behind Warden at (2,4) who faces S. I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying hidden. After that, move to (4,4) to get behind Marksman for a breach next turn — Marksman is more dangerous than Warden.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm suppressed so only 1 move. Longshot is wounded and I'm already behind them (facing E, I'm to their west at 2,3 which is behind). Move to (2,3) then breach Longshot — they're wounded so breaching their actions next turn neutralizes the enemy damage dealer. This fulfills my orders to assassinate the enemy damage dealer.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent at (4,4) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Ghost is a specter not a Vector, so I need to check if this applies. The warning says 'blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' — Ghost is a specter, so precision_shot should still be usable. However, Ghost is at dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles and needs LoS. Adjacent means dist=1 which is ≤2, so it should be in range. But wait — if I move first, precision_shot deals 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Better to shoot first then move. Longshot is wounded and highest priority but at dist=3, out of range. I should move toward Longshot after shooting Ghost, or retreat. Orders say prioritize killing wounded enemies. Ghost is healthy and adjacent — threat. I'll use precision_shot on Ghost first (2dmg, no movement penalty), then move to (5,4) to gain distance from Ghost while potentially getting closer to Longshot.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from combat. I'm at (3,3). Allies are at (4,4) and (3,2). Enemies are at (2,4), (2,3), (5,4). The edge furthest from combat and allies would be toward (5,3) or further right. Moving to (5,3) gets me to the east edge area and away from the cluster of enemies on the west side.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is at (2,3), just 2 tiles away. I can move to (2,2) to get adjacent and attack. This also positions me between allies and the enemy cluster. Moving loses Fortify but attacking Phantom is worth it.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) fortified with 7HP. Ghost is at (4,4) dist=2, Warden at (2,2) dist=2. Phantom ally is wounded at (2,3) between me and Warden - threat from south. Orders say push forward aggressively toward enemy cluster. Ghost is east at (4,4). I should move toward Ghost to close distance and get into attack range. Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Ghost at (4,4) - then I can attack. Shield_wall facing E would protect Marksman ally at (5,4) from Ghost. Move to (3,4) first, then attack Ghost.
  State: Ghost 1/5, Warden 10/10, Longshot 2/5, Warden 7/10, Marksman 5/5, Phantom 3/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,3) ✓
  💭 Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining so I can't breach this turn. I'm not cloaked. The enemy Warden is adjacent at (2,2) facing W — I can move to (3,2) to get behind them, then shadow_strike to deal damage without breaking cloak (but I'm not cloaked). Actually, I should prioritize Longshot (the damage dealer per orders). I can reach (4,3) which is behind Longshot and adjacent. Move to (4,3), then shadow_strike Longshot at (5,3). This advances my assassination mission and positions me perfectly.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical priority is survival and high-value play. Three enemies adjacent. Phantom is wounded (easy kill with shadow_strike). I can move to (3,3) which is behind Phantom, then shadow_strike to finish them without breaking cloak. But wait — I'm NOT cloaked (no mention of cloak status). At 1HP I need to eliminate threats fast. Phantom at (4,3) is wounded and adjacent — shadow_strike keeps cloak if I had it, but regular attack works too. Best play: shadow_strike Phantom (wounded, adjacent at dist=1) to eliminate them, then move to (3,3) or (4,5) to escape the remaining two healthy enemies. Actually shadow_strike requires adjacent — Phantom IS adjacent. Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak. If Phantom is wounded they may be at low HP and this could finish them. Move first to avoid being surrounded, then shadow_strike. Move to (4,5) to escape Warden and get away, but I lose Phantom kill. Better: shadow_strike Phantom first (they're wounded, this likely kills), then move away from the remaining two.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → attack(5,3) ✓
  💭 Two critical enemies in range. Longshot is adjacent at (5,3) which blocks precision_shot due to Vector adjacency rule - wait, Longshot is a striker not a Vector, so precision_shot is only blocked by adjacent enemy Vectors. Longshot is adjacent but not a Vector, so I can still use precision_shot. However, if I moved this turn, precision_shot does only 1dmg. I haven't moved yet. Ghost is at dist=2 (critical), Longshot is at dist=1 (critical). I should fire precision_shot at one critical enemy to finish them. Longshot is adjacent so attack also works for 1dmg. Best: use precision_shot on Ghost at dist=2 for 2dmg (should kill critical), then use attack on Longshot for 1dmg (or precision_shot if still available - can only use one ability). So: precision_shot Ghost first (2dmg, kills critical), then attack Longshot (1dmg, should kill critical too).
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,2) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are 3+ tiles away, none in attack range. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Moving would break Fortify. Best to hold position and use shield_wall toward the east where enemies are clustered. Warden and Phantom are both to the northeast, Marksman further east. I'll shield_wall east to protect any allies from that direction.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is at distance 3, out of attack range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (2,3) closes distance to Warden to 1 tile (adjacent), enabling attack. Phantom is wounded at (4,3) — after moving I should attack the Warden to pressure them. Move to (2,3) then attack Warden at (2,2).
  State: Warden 9/10, Warden 7/10, Marksman 5/5, Phantom 2/5 | Dead: Ghost, Longshot

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP so need to be careful. The enemy Warden is at (2,2) facing W, meaning I can breach from behind by moving to (3,2). That position is behind the Warden and adjacent. I'll move to (3,2) then breach the Warden — breach doesn't break cloak and forces them to obey me next turn, which neutralizes their threat. This is tactically sound even at low HP since breach doesn't require attacking.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is at distance 5, out of my range 2. I need to close the gap. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while maintaining good positioning. From there I still won't be in range, but I'll be better positioned for next turn.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move south toward (2,0). Valid moves include (2,1) and (2,0). I can reach (2,0) in one move since it's 2 tiles south and my mv is 2. Moving directly to (2,0) follows orders. No ability needed.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,1) ✓ → attack(2,0) ✓
  💭 Warden is at (2,0), distance 3. I'm fortified at (2,3) with 7HP. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (2,1) closes distance to 1 (adjacent), enabling an attack. Phantom is wounded so I should be aggressive to draw fire. Move south to (2,1), then attack Warden.
  State: Warden 8/10, Warden 7/10, Marksman 5/5, Phantom 2/5 | Dead: Ghost, Longshot

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 2HP, cloaked. Enemy Warden is at (2,0) facing S - dist 3, no breach available and no tiles behind reachable. No enemies in range. Ally Warden is at (2,1) adjacent to enemy Warden. I should move closer to engage. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer to the enemy Warden at (2,0) - then shadow_strike from adjacent would deal damage while keeping cloak. From (3,1) I can reach (2,0) if I move there directly... wait, (2,0) is distance 2 from (3,2). Let me check: from (3,1) to (2,0) is distance 2, but I need to be adjacent. Move to (2,1) puts me adjacent to enemy Warden at (2,0), then shadow_strike to preserve cloak. But ally Warden is at (2,1) - can't end there. Move to (3,1) first, then shadow_strike at (2,0) - distance 2, not adjacent. Actually shadow_strike is range:adjacent only. From (3,0) I'd be adjacent to (2,0). Let me move to (3,0) which is in valid moves, then shadow_strike on Warden at (2,0) - that's adjacent (dist=1). Yes.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is at (2,0), dist=5, out of my range-2. No enemies in range currently. My ally Phantom is wounded at (3,0). I need to move closer to get the enemy Warden in range. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer while maintaining a safe position. From (3,2), the enemy at (2,0) would be dist=~2.8, still out of range-2. Let me try (3,1) - not in valid moves. Best move is (3,2) to close distance. From there dist to (2,0) = sqrt(1+4)=2.24, still just out of range-2. Moving to (2,3) gets dist to (2,0)=3, no better. I'll move to (3,2) to get closer and wait for next turn to engage.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,0) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) S ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (2,0) to my south. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I should attack the adjacent enemy while maintaining my position to keep the fortify bonus. Attack first, then shield_wall facing south to protect allies from the enemy cluster.
- **Warden** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move south to (2,0) but I'm already at (2,0). I cannot move further south as that would be off the map. I'll wait in place, keeping my fortified status for the 50% damage reduction.
  State: Warden 6/10, Warden 7/10, Marksman 5/5, Phantom 2/5 | Dead: Ghost, Longshot

### Turn 7 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(2,0) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is wounded and adjacent at (2,0). I'm at 2HP so need to finish this fast. Breach is unavailable. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1dmg — if Warden is wounded (likely 1-2HP), shadow_strike could finish them. I'm already cloaked, so shadow_strike maintains cloak. Execute shadow_strike on Warden at (2,0).
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,0) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Wounded enemy Warden at (2,0) is in range (dist=3, within range 2? Wait - dist=3 but range is ≤2 tiles). Recon says inRange:true for Warden at dist=3. I'm at (3,2), enemy at (2,0) - that's distance sqrt(1+4)=~2.24, so tile distance is |3-2|+|2-0|=1+2=3 Manhattan. But the recon confirms inRange:true. I have not moved this turn so precision_shot does full 2dmg. The enemy is wounded so 2dmg should finish them. I'll fire precision_shot at the wounded Warden, then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm already at (2,0) which is the southern edge. Orders say to move south to (2,0) but I'm already here. I should wait to maintain fortify bonus and keep 50% damage reduction active.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (2,0), wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I can attack the wounded Warden to finish them off. Since I'm already in position and fortified, I should attack without moving to keep the fortify bonus — but I need to attack first, then stay put. Actually, attacking doesn't require moving. I'll attack the Warden at (2,0) and then wait to maintain fortify next turn.
  State: Warden 4/10, Warden 7/10, Marksman 5/5, Phantom 2/5 | Dead: Ghost, Longshot

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 2HP, cloaked. Enemy Warden is at (2,0) wounded and 3 tiles away. Breach is unavailable. I need to close distance to get adjacent for shadow_strike. Moving to (3,1) then (2,1) would place me adjacent but (2,1) is occupied by allied Warden. Best path: move to (3,0) to get within 2 tiles, then shadow_strike from (3,0) won't work since shadow_strike requires adjacent. Move closer - go to (3,0) which is distance 1 from Warden at (2,0). Then shadow_strike the Warden to finish them off while staying cloaked.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,0) ✓
  💭 Wounded enemy Warden at (2,0) is in range (dist=3) from my current position (3,2). Precision_shot has range ≤2 tiles, so dist=3 is out of range for that. I need to move closer. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist=2 from (2,0), within precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet this turn so precision_shot will deal full 2dmg, likely finishing the wounded Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Warden is adjacent at (2,1) and Phantom is wounded adjacent at (3,0). If I stay put, fortify keeps me alive longer. Attack the wounded Phantom to eliminate the threat, then I can still benefit from fortify. Moving would lose fortify. Best play: attack Phantom to finish it off, then wait to keep fortify active.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,0) ✓ → shield_wall(3,0) S ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (2,0) and critical — one attack should finish them. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Phantom is critical at (3,0) but the Warden is my primary target. Attack the Warden first to eliminate them, then shield_wall south to protect Phantom if needed. Actually, Warden is already at dist=1, so attack immediately. After the attack, I'll stay put to maintain fortify bonus and shield_wall facing S to cover Phantom.
