Valid moves show (3,3) which puts me adjacent to Warden at (3,2) and Aegis at (2,2), but that's moving toward Phantom.

Compromise: move to (1,2) to get somewhat closer to Warden while slightly away from Phantom, but still not adjacent. Actually valid tiles include (3,3) which is adjacent to Warden at (3,2).
