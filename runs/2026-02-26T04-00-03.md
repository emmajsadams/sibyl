## Squads
### Player
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
### Opponent
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(2,1) ✓
  💭 Prophet enemy is at (2,1), distance 4 — exactly in scan range. I need to move closer to scan them. Moving to (3,2) puts me at distance 3 from Prophet, well within scan range, and I avoid adjacency to any enemies. Then scan Prophet to reveal their strategy and deal 1 damage.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(4,0) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 - cloak immediately as ordered. Enemy Prophet is closest at dist 3 at (3,2) facing S, with behind tile at (3,3). I'll cloak first, then move toward Prophet to set up a shadow_strike or breach next turn. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer while staying in valid moves range.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Prophet (enemy oracle) is in scan range at dist=2. Scan reveals their prompt and deals 1dmg. I should scan Prophet first, then consider moving to maintain distance. Current position is safe - not adjacent to any enemy Vector.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range (dist 7-9). I need to advance to get within range 2. Moving to (5,3) gets me closer while staying on the edge. Then wait to see if enemies advance.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,0) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Prophet at (3,2), distance 4. I need to advance toward them. From (1,0) moving to (3,0) gets me closer (distance 3 to Prophet). No enemies adjacent so no attack. After moving, use shield_wall facing North since enemies are generally to the north.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are 5 tiles away, out of range. I should advance toward the front line to position between allies and threats. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to the enemy Warden at (3,0) and the enemy Prophet at (1,2), while positioning between them and my allies Hawk at (5,3) and Prophet at (3,2). If I don't move after positioning, Fortify gives 50% damage reduction.
  State: Warden 8/8, Phantom 4/4, Prophet 5/6, Hawk 4/4, Warden 8/8, Prophet 5/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is already scanned. Warden at (3,3) is in scan range (dist=3) and unscanned — scan it to reveal its prompt and deal 1dmg. No need to move, current position is safe and at good range.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,0) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Prophet tried to scan me last turn and Phantom is cloaking and moving toward (4,2). I'm at (3,2), 5/6 HP. Priority: scan enemy Warden at (3,0) to reveal its prompt (dist=2, in range). Then move away from (4,2) where Phantom will be — move to (2,2) puts me at safe distance while keeping scan range on enemies. I should NOT move adjacent to enemy vectors. Warden is sentinel not vector so scan is safe. Recalibrate on Hawk could help but scanning unknown Warden is higher priority.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → breach(2,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak has 1 turn remaining — I must use it now. Prophet at (2,2) faces W, meaning I'm already behind it from (3,2). I can move to (3,2) to get adjacent and behind the Prophet, then use breach to take control of this high-value oracle unit. (3,2) is in my valid moves list and is the behind tile for Prophet.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom at (3,2) is in range (dist=3, within my range:2? No, dist=3 exceeds range 2). Actually precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Phantom is at dist=3, so out of range. No enemies in range for precision_shot. I should reposition. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Phantom at (3,2) - dist would be 2, putting it in range. Not adjacent to enemy so precision_shot won't be blocked. Then use precision_shot on Phantom.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 All enemies are at distance 3, none adjacent. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Enemies are clustered north at (2,2), (3,3), (4,2). Moving to (3,1) advances me north toward them while keeping me centered. Then I'll use shield_wall facing North since all enemies are to my north, protecting adjacent allies from incoming fire.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,2) — attack it. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Warden is at (3,1) behind Phantom. Attack Phantom first, then use shield_wall facing South to protect allies behind me.
  State: Warden 7/8, Phantom 2/4, Prophet 5/6, Hawk 4/4, Warden 7/8, Prophet 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(2,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) already behind Prophet at (2,2) facing W. Breach is on cooldown. I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best play: use shadow_strike on Prophet (adjacent, high-value oracle target) for 1 damage, then move to (4,3) to get behind Hawk for a future breach next turn when cooldown expires.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(4,3) ✓ → move(0,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward own back line, then attack nearest ally. My allies are Hawk @(4,2) and Warden @(3,3). Moving toward back line means moving west/toward lower x. Prophet (ally oracle) is at (1,2) - that's actually an enemy Prophet. Wait, checking factions: Prophet(oracle,A,spd3) is ally. Looking at enemies in range: Prophet @(1,2) dist=1 is listed as enemy. Orders say attack nearest ally. My allies are Hawk @(4,2) and Warden @(3,3). Neither is adjacent. I can scan the Phantom (wounded, dist=3, in scan range). But orders say attack nearest ally. I can only attack adjacent units. No ally is adjacent. I'll move toward back line (west) to (0,2) or similar, then scan Phantom since I can't attack an ally. Moving to (0,2) - valid. Then scan Phantom @(4,3) dist would be 4+1=5, out of range after move. From (2,2) Phantom is dist=3, so scan now. I'll scan Phantom first, then move west toward back line.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(4,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Hawk's prompt is unknown and it's a striker that moved to attack Phantom last turn. I should scan Hawk to reveal its strategy and deal 1 damage. Prophet is adjacent at (0,2) which blocks scan per rules — wait, scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not oracle. Prophet is an oracle not a vector, so scan should work. Hawk is at dist=3, within scan range. After scanning, I can move to (2,2) to maintain distance from the enemy Prophet at (0,2) and stay at range from Hawk.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(4,3) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is critical and adjacent at (4,3). I'm not adjacent to any enemy (Phantom is at dist 1 but that means 1 tile away, which is adjacent). Wait - Phantom at (4,3) is adjacent to me at (4,2). precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. So I must use attack or suppressing_fire on Phantom. Attack does 1dmg - if Phantom is critical (1HP likely), attack would finish them. Then I can move away from threats. Let me attack Phantom to eliminate them, then move to (5,2) to reposition away from the enemy cluster.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Nearest enemy is Warden at (3,3), dist=2. I need to advance toward it. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Warden at (3,3). Most enemies are to the N/E. After moving I lose Fortify, but I can attack the Warden if adjacent. Move to (3,2) then attack Warden at (3,3).
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,2) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction. Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2) to my south — I should attack it. If I move, I lose Fortify. Best play: attack the adjacent Warden, then use shield_wall to protect allies from the enemy Prophet at (2,2). Stay put to keep Fortify active.
  State: Warden 6/8, Prophet 5/6, Hawk 3/4, Warden 6/8, Prophet 4/6 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 4 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(3,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no new scan targets needed. I'm at 5/6 HP, ally Warden is healthy at (3,2). Hawk is the primary threat with precision_shot targeting wounded enemies. Enemy Prophet will scan and recalibrate — I should stay mobile. Warden enemy holds front line. I can recalibrate our Warden to boost effectiveness, then reposition to maintain safe distance. Warden is adjacent at (3,2), so recalibrate is valid. Then move away from Hawk's range or stay safe.
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(1,2) ✓ → move(0,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and attack nearest ally. My allies are Hawk at (5,2) and Warden at (3,3). Moving away from them means moving west/toward back line. Prophet at (1,2) is my nearest ally and is adjacent. I should move away first, then attack. Moving to (2,2) keeps me away from allies and Prophet remains adjacent or close enough to attack. Actually, Prophet is at (1,2) and is adjacent - I can attack them from current position (0,2). Let me move away first to (0,4) to increase distance from allies, but then Prophet won't be in attack range. Better to attack Prophet first while adjacent, then move away to (0,4) or (2,2). Attack is range:adjacent only, so I need to be adjacent to attack. Prophet at (1,2) is 1 tile away - adjacent. I'll attack Prophet first, then move away toward back line at (0,4).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is at (3,2), dist=2, in range. I'm at (5,2) with 3HP. I haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Warden is healthy so 2dmg won't kill, but it's solid damage. No adjacent enemy so precision_shot is not blocked. Fire first, then wait — no need to move and risk losing precision_shot damage.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction which is valuable. Orders say attack Warden from N or S to bypass its W-facing shield_wall — I'm directly south at (3,2), so attacking from S bypasses its shield. I can attack Warden now without moving to keep fortify active.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,3) with 50% damage reduction, and the enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2). I should attack the Warden while staying fortified - but if I move I lose Fortify. Better to attack in place and keep the damage reduction. I'll attack the adjacent Warden, then use shield_wall facing south to protect allies behind me, or just wait to maintain fortify.
  State: Warden 4/8, Prophet 4/6, Hawk 3/4, Warden 5/8, Prophet 4/6 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 5 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → recalibrate(3,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Prophet already recalibrated ally Warden and attacked me last turn. All enemy prompts are known. The enemy Warden at (3,3) is within scan range (dist=3) but already scanned. Enemy Prophet at (0,4) also already scanned. My wounded ally Warden at (3,2) is taking heavy fire — Hawk precision_shot and both Wardens attacked it. I should recalibrate the ally Warden to help it survive. I'm at (1,2), ally Warden is at (3,2) — that's distance 2, not adjacent. I need to move closer to recalibrate. Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to ally Warden at (3,2). Then recalibrate to boost the wounded Warden's effectiveness.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward back line, then attack nearest ally. My allies are Hawk at (5,2) and Warden at (3,3). I'm at (0,4). Moving toward back line means moving away from enemies (toward lower x or higher y). Nearest ally is Warden at (3,3) - distance 4. I need to get adjacent to attack. Moving to (3,4) gets me adjacent to Warden at (3,3). That satisfies both orders: moving toward the back area and getting in range to attack the ally.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wounded enemy Warden is at (3,2), distance 2 - within precision_shot range. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. 2 damage will finish off the wounded Warden. I'll fire first, then hold position or reposition. No need to move before shooting.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction at (3,3). Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2) and wounded — I should attack it to finish it off. Staying in place preserves my Fortify passive. Attack the Warden, then wait to keep fortification.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) E ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP (wounded) and fortified. The enemy Warden at (3,3) is adjacent and wounded — I can attack it. The Hawk to the east will precision_shot me if I'm wounded. I should attack the Warden (adjacent, wounded, good target) then use shield_wall facing E to reduce Hawk's precision_shot damage. Staying put preserves Fortify for 50% damage reduction.
  State: Warden 2/8, Prophet 4/6, Hawk 3/4, Warden 3/8, Prophet 4/6 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 6 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(3,2) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Warden will shield_wall toward (2,2) facing E — that's my position, so I'm about to get hit. Ally Warden at (3,2) is critical and is being targeted by Hawk precision_shot and enemy Warden attack. I need to recalibrate my ally Warden to help them survive. I'm adjacent to ally Warden at (3,2), so recalibrate is valid. After recalibrating, I should move away from (2,2) to avoid the enemy Warden's shield_wall facing E. Moving to (1,2) keeps me safe and maintains scan range on all enemies for future turns.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → recalibrate(5,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows enemy Prophet will move to (3,4) — my current position — and attack (3,3) where our Warden is. I need to move away from (3,4) to avoid being in the Prophet's path and stay safe. Moving to (4,4) keeps me at range from enemies and out of the Prophet's planned position. The enemy Warden at (3,2) is critical — Hawk already precision_shot it, our Warden attacked it. It's likely dead or nearly dead after this round. Prophet at (1,2) is 4 tiles away — just at scan range from current position but out of range per recon data. I should move to improve my position and then recalibrate Hawk (our striker at (5,2)) to boost their effectiveness against remaining enemies. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,2)? No, (5,2) to (4,3) is distance 2. I need to be adjacent for recalibrate. Move to (5,3) to be adjacent to Hawk at (5,2), then recalibrate Hawk with an addendum to focus on the Prophet.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Warden at (3,2) is critical and in range at dist=2 — precision_shot for 2dmg should finish them. I haven't moved so precision_shot gets full damage. After killing Warden, I need to close on Prophet at (1,2) who is dist=4. My max move is 2 tiles. Move to (4,2) or (3,2) after kill to close distance. Actually, shoot first then move toward Prophet. Moving to (4,1) or (4,2) gets me closer but Prophet still at dist=3-4. Best: shoot Warden first (precision_shot, no movement penalty), then move west toward Prophet.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(4,2) E ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with fortify active (50% dmg reduction). Two enemies adjacent: Hawk at (4,2) to my East and Warden at (3,3) to my North. Orders say use shield_wall facing E to block enemy Warden, then attack enemy Warden. But Hawk is the priority target per intel. I need to survive this turn — shield_wall facing E blocks damage from East direction (Hawk). Then attack the Warden at (3,3) from my current position since it's adjacent and wounded. Staying put keeps fortify active.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP but fortified (50% damage reduction). Enemy Warden is adjacent at (3,2) and critical — I should attack to finish it off. I'm already fortified so I should NOT move (would lose fortify passive). Attack the Warden, then wait to keep fortify active.
  State: Prophet 4/6, Hawk 3/4, Warden 2/8, Prophet 4/6 | Dead: Warden, Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no new scan targets available (Prophet is out of range at dist 5). Warden is critical and adjacent ally Prophet moved to (1,2) last turn per Foresight — I should recalibrate my allied Prophet to boost effectiveness. Wait, Foresight shows enemy Prophet recalibrated toward (3,2) and allied Prophet moved to (1,2). My ally Prophet is at (1,2) which is my current position — conflict, I must be there too. Actually I'm at (1,2). Foresight shows enemy Prophet recalibrate→(5,2) this turn. My best action: I have no new scan targets in range. Warden is critical — attack is only adjacent. I should recalibrate allied Prophet if adjacent. Allied Prophet is at same tile or adjacent? Orders say recalibrate on wounded allies. Since all enemies scanned and Prophet ally likely adjacent, I'll move to maintain safe distance and recalibrate ally Prophet. Move to (1,3) to check adjacency, or just recalibrate if Prophet is at (1,2) with me — but can't recalibrate self. Prophet ally was at (3,2) last turn and moved to (1,2) per Foresight. We're co-located. I'll move to (1,1) to stay safe and wait — no valid recalibrate target adjacent and no new scan targets. Best: wait and move to safer position away from Hawk at (4,2).
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(0,2) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (0,2), distance 6 — out of scan range (max 4). Need to close distance. Warden is critical at (3,3) — recalibrate could help but scan is priority. Move to (2,3) to get within scan range of Prophet (dist would be 2). Then scan Prophet. Wait — valid moves don't include (2,3)... checking: valid tiles are [2,3] — yes it is there. From (2,3) Prophet at (0,2) would be dist = |2-0|+|3-2| = 3, within range 4. Move to (2,3) then scan Prophet.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(0,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Prophet is at (0,2), dist=4. I need to close to range 2. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist=2 from (0,2), enabling precision_shot. I haven't moved this turn yet so precision_shot will deal 2dmg to the wounded Prophet, likely finishing them.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,3) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, fortified at (3,3). Enemy Prophet is at (0,2), dist 4, out of range. Allies Hawk@(2,2) and Prophet@(2,3) are healthy. If I move toward the enemy I lose fortify and my 50% damage reduction - at 2HP that's dangerous. Better to hold position, maintain fortify bonus, and shield_wall west to protect allies from the enemy Prophet approaching from the west.
  State: Prophet 2/6, Hawk 3/4, Warden 2/8, Prophet 4/6 | Dead: Warden, Phantom

### Turn 8 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/6 HP (critical), and Hawk has precision_shot targeting me. Foresight shows Hawk will move to (2,2) and precision_shot me — I need to survive this round. I should move to break line of sight or get out of range. Moving to (0,5) or (0,4) puts distance between me and Hawk. Warden is at (3,3) facing W with shield_wall — already scanned. Prophet at (2,3) will scan me again. My priority: survive by repositioning north to (0,5) to increase distance from Hawk. All enemies are already scanned so no scan needed. I can wait after moving since I have no good targets that aren't already revealed.
- **Prophet** (oracle): recalibrate(2,2) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (0,5), distance 4 from my current position (2,3) — just out of scan range (need ≤4, dist=4 means exactly 4 which should be borderline). Foresight shows Prophet will move to (0,2) next — that puts them further. I should move to close distance and then scan, or recalibrate Hawk to boost our damage dealer. Hawk is healthy at (2,2) and adjacent to me — recalibrate is adjacent only, so I can recalibrate Hawk from current position. Orders say use recalibrate on damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Hawk is our striker/damage dealer. I'll recalibrate Hawk first, then consider position. Actually, recalibrate is adjacent only and Hawk is at (2,2) which is adjacent to my (2,3). I'll recalibrate Hawk, then move to maintain positioning away from Prophet.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Prophet is at (0,5), distance 5 — out of my range 2. I need to close distance. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer while staying away from the edge. From (1,3) the Prophet at (0,5) is still distance ~3, still out of range. Best I can do is move twice worth — move to (1,4) puts me adjacent to my ally Prophet, and the enemy Prophet at (0,5) would be distance 1 from (1,4)... wait, (1,4) to (0,5) is dist = |1-0|+|4-5| = 2, which is within my range 2! Move to (1,4) then use precision_shot on Prophet at (0,5). Check: I moved, so precision_shot deals 1dmg. Enemy Prophet is wounded so this may finish them. Valid move: (1,4) is in my valid moves list? Checking: [[0,2],[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[2,0],[2,1],[2,3],[2,4],[3,1],[3,2],[4,2]] — (1,4) is NOT listed. (2,4) is listed. From (2,4) to (0,5): dist = |2-0|+|4-5| = 3, still out of range. Try (1,3): dist to (0,5) = |1-0|+|3-5| = 3, still out of range. Best valid move toward target: (1,3) or (1,2). None bring enemy in range. Move to (1,3) to best position for next round, and wait as second action.
- **Warden** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/8 HP but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Enemy Prophet is at (0,5), dist=5, out of range. Allies Hawk@(1,3) and Prophet@(1,4) are healthy. I should hold the front line and position between allies and the enemy. Moving west toward (2,4) keeps me between allies and the enemy Prophet approaching from northwest, while maintaining fortify if I don't move. Actually, staying put preserves fortify bonus which is critical at 2HP. I'll wait to keep the damage reduction active.
  State: Prophet 2/6, Hawk 3/4, Warden 2/8, Prophet 4/6 | Dead: Warden, Phantom
