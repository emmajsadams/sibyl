## Squads
### Player
- **Patch** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Snare** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(1,1) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. Then advance toward Wraith (enemy specter, priority target as damage dealer). Move to (1,3) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1, cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward enemies. Bolt is at (4,1) facing N, Patch at (2,0) facing N. I should move south/toward enemies while cloaked. Best move is toward (3,3) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Enemies are far away at dist=5. I should advance toward the sentinel Bastion to get into a support position behind them. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to the action while staying safe. No good overclock targets this turn since allies aren't adjacent. I'll just advance.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (4,1). Nearest enemy is Snare at dist=4, need to close to range 2. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while staying at distance 3 from Snare at (3,4). From (4,3), Snare is at dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, actually Manhattan dist=1+1=2, which is exactly in range 2. Let me verify: (4,3) to (3,4) = |4-3|+|3-4| = 1+1 = 2. Yes, that puts Snare in range. But Snare is a Vector - need to check if I'd be adjacent. Adjacent means dist=1. From (4,3) to (3,4) dist=2, not adjacent. Good. Move to (4,3) then use precision_shot on Snare.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 Orders say push forward aggressively. Enemies are at dist 3-4, out of range. I should advance toward the enemy cluster. Patch is at (2,2), dist 3 - closest threat. Moving to (2,3) gets me closer. Then shield_wall facing S toward the enemies to protect allies Wraith and Snare behind me.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(4,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at (4,3) distance 2 — in trap range. I can place a trap on (4,4) or (5,4) to block Bolt's advance. Moving to (4,4) would put me adjacent to Bolt enabling Denial, but exposes me. Better to stay at (3,4) and place a trap on (4,4) to punish Bolt's likely advance northward toward our backline. This denies the corridor while keeping me at safe range.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Phantom 4/4, Patch 9/9, Wraith 4/4, Snare 6/7, Bastion 12/12

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,4) ✓ → breach(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Orders say to prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer and use breach on sentinels. Bastion (sentinel) is adjacent at (2,3) facing S — I can move to (2,4) to get behind them, then breach. Snare (vector) is the denial threat but far away. Breaching Bastion will break their defensive posture and let me control them next turn. Move to (2,4) first (behind Bastion), then breach Bastion.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Bolt is adjacent to my south-east but I'm not behind them (they face N, behind is (4,2)). I can move to (4,2) to get behind Bolt, then shadow_strike to deal damage while staying cloaked. This is ideal — shadow_strike doesn't break cloak.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,2) ✗ Position occupied → patch(4,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Bolt is wounded at 3/4 HP and needs healing, but is dist=3 away. I need to move closer to Bolt to heal. Bastion (sentinel) is at (2,3) to my north — I should move around or through toward Bolt at (4,3). Moving to (3,2) gets me closer (dist to Bolt becomes 2, still not adjacent). Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Bolt at (4,3) — distance 1, so I can heal. Let me check: from (4,2) to (4,3) is adjacent. That works. But I need to avoid being adjacent to Snare (vector) at (4,4) — from (4,2) dist to Snare is 2, so not adjacent, no denial. Move to (4,2), then patch Bolt at (4,3).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,2) ✗ Position occupied → precision_shot(4,4) ✗ Cannot use precision_shot — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare (vector) at (4,4) which blocks precision_shot via denial zone. I need to move away first. Moving to (5,2) puts me at distance 2 from Snare and distance 3 from Bastion. Better: move to (4,2) keeps range 2 from Snare and 2 from Bastion, escaping denial. Actually (5,3) is distance 1 from Snare still adjacent diagonally - check: dist to (4,4) from (5,3) = 1. Move to (4,2): dist to Snare(4,4)=2, dist to Bastion(2,3)=2. Both in range, out of denial. Then precision_shot Snare (healthy but closest threat, and orders say use it on most wounded - both healthy, no medic visible, target Snare as primary threat).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward my own backline. My allies are Wraith @(4,2) and Snare @(4,4). My backline is to the south (lower y). I'm at (2,3). Moving to (1,2) takes me away from allies and toward the backline. I can move up to 2 tiles. Going to (0,3) or (1,2) both work — (1,2) moves me south and west, away from allies clustered on the right side.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(4,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bolt is adjacent at (4,3) - my Denial passive is blocking some of their abilities. I'm already standing on a trap at (4,4). Bolt is right next to me, so I should pulse to hit them for 1dmg, then move to (3,5) to maintain medium range and set up a trap on a likely approach path. Phantom is at (2,4) distance 2 - moving to (3,5) keeps them at range. Actually, pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - that includes allies? Let me check: Wraith is at (4,2) dist=2, Bastion at (1,2) dist=far. No allies within 1 tile of me. So pulse safely hits Bolt for 1dmg. Then move to (3,5) to get off the approach corridor and lay a trap there later - but I can only do move+ability. So: pulse Bolt first (1dmg), then move to (3,5) to reposition away from Bolt while staying at medium range to both enemies.
  State: Bolt 2/4, Phantom 4/4, Patch 9/9, Wraith 4/4, Snare 6/7, Bastion 12/12

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown so I can't use it this turn. Snare (vector) is at (3,5) — I need to avoid being adjacent to it or my abilities get blocked. The recon shows I can reach (3,4) which is behind Snare and adjacent to it, but moving there would put me in Snare's denial range. Orders say assassinate the enemy damage dealer. Bastion is sentinel (defensive), not priority. I'm not cloaked currently (no mention of cloak status, and tip says don't recloak). Let me position to threaten Snare from behind when breach comes off cooldown next turn. Moving to (1,3) would put me behind Bastion and adjacent for a potential breach or shadow_strike next turn. But orders prioritize the damage dealer — if Snare is the vector (damage dealer?), I should position to strike it. Actually Snare is a vector which blocks my abilities when adjacent — risky. Let me move toward (3,4) to be behind Snare, then shadow_strike from adjacent won't be blocked since shadow_strike only requires adjacent, not ability-blocking check... wait, vector blocks cloak/breach, not shadow_strike. So I can shadow_strike Snare from (3,4). Move to (3,4), then shadow_strike Snare at (3,5).
- **Wraith** (specter): shadow_strike(4,3) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining, behind Bolt (wounded striker at 4,3 facing N). I'm already at (4,2) which is behind Bolt. I can shadow_strike Bolt to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked — perfect use of remaining cloak. Bolt is wounded so this may finish them. No need to move first.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(4,3) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at 1/4 HP and critically wounded — top priority is healing. I'm at (2,2), Bolt is at (4,3), dist=3, not adjacent. I need to move toward Bolt to get adjacent. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer (dist from 3,2 to 4,3 = 2, still not adjacent). Moving to (3,3) puts me at dist=1 from Bolt at (4,3) — adjacent! But I need to check if (3,3) is in valid moves: yes, [3,3] is listed. Also need to check for Vector denial: Snare is at (3,5), dist=4 from me, not adjacent at (3,3). From (3,3), Wraith at (2,1) dist=3, Bastion at (1,2) dist=3 — no enemies adjacent, so patch won't be blocked. Move to (3,3) then patch Bolt at (4,3).
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is in range at dist 3, but I must NOT move adjacent to Snare. Snare is at (3,5) which is 3 tiles away — safe to shoot from current position (4,3). No enemies are wounded, and there's no enemy medic visible. Snare is the only target in range. I'll use precision_shot on Snare from current position — I haven't moved so full 2dmg applies. Stay put to maintain range and avoid adjacency.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(0,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward own backline. Allies are at (2,1) and (3,5). I'm at (1,2) facing S. My backline would be the south/southwest area. Moving to (0,1) takes me away from allies and toward the backline corner. I'll wait as second action to maintain Fortify.
- **Snare** (vector): pulse(3,5) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,4) - my Denial passive is already blocking their cloak. Patch is at (3,3) in range 2. Both are clustered along the same column. I can pulse to hit Phantom (dist 1) for 1 damage, then move away to avoid being surrounded. Moving to (2,5) or (4,5) keeps distance. Actually, pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - Phantom at dist 1 gets hit. Then I should reposition. Moving to (2,5) pulls back from Phantom. Alternatively, place a trap at (4,4) is already trapped. I should place a trap on an approach path - (2,4) or (2,5) to cover western approach. But first, pulse Phantom for immediate damage since they're adjacent and dangerous.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Phantom 3/4, Patch 9/9, Wraith 4/4, Snare 5/7, Bastion 12/12

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4), not cloaked. Wraith is the priority target (enemy specter, damage dealer) at (2,1). I can reach (3,1) which is directly behind Wraith and adjacent — perfect for breach. Move to (3,1), then breach Wraith from behind. This uses my 2nd breach charge and deals with the primary threat. Snare is closer but Vector denial would block abilities if I get adjacent — avoid. Wraith is the assassination priority.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward edge of map, away from enemy positions. Allies are at (2,5) and (0,1). Enemies cluster around (3,1), (3,3), (4,3). Edge tiles away from enemies would be bottom or left edge. (0,0) or (1,0) or (4,0) or (5,1) are edge tiles. (5,1) is farthest from allies but moves toward enemies. (0,0) moves away from enemies toward corner. I can move up to 3 tiles. From (2,1) going to (0,0) is 3 tiles away - valid per move list. That puts me at bottom-left corner, away from enemies and allies.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position (4,3). Snare is the closest at dist 4, out of my range 2. Need to close distance to get Snare in range. Moving to (4,5) gets me closer to Snare at (2,5) - new dist would be 3, still out of range. Moving to (3,4) puts me at dist 3 from Snare (2,5). No move gets me within range 2 of Snare. Best I can do is move toward them. (4,5) is valid and closes distance toward Snare. From (4,5), Snare at (2,5) is dist 2 - that's in range! Let me verify: |4-2|+|5-5|=2, yes dist=2. Move to (4,5) then precision_shot Snare.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → patch(3,1) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded at (3,1) with 3/4 HP, 2 tiles away. I need to move toward Phantom to heal. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to Phantom at (3,1) — distance 1, so I can patch. Snare is at (2,5), 3 tiles away, so moving to (3,2) keeps me safe from denial range. After moving to (3,2), Phantom at (3,1) is adjacent (south), so I can patch.
- **Snare** (vector): trap(3,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Bolt is at dist=2, within my range. I can place a trap on (3,5) to block Bolt's advance toward my backline, then move to maintain distance. Bolt is adjacent-ish so I should be careful about Denial blocking my trap if I get too close. Current position (2,5), Bolt at (4,5). If I trap (3,5) first, that's within range ≤2 and not adjacent to an enemy vector. Then move west to (1,5) to maintain distance and keep denying area.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(0,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward my own backline. I'm at (0,1) facing S. Allies are at (0,0) and (1,5). My backline would be the south/west edge. Moving to (0,3) gets me away from Wraith at (0,0) and toward the back. Wait as second action to maintain Fortify passive.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Phantom 4/4, Patch 9/9, Wraith 4/4, Snare 4/7, Bastion 12/12

### Turn 5 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge of the map, away from enemy positions. I'm at (0,0) which is already a corner. Allies are at (1,5) and (0,3) — north of me. Enemies are northeast. Moving east along the bottom edge puts me away from allies and toward the map edge away from the cluster of enemies at (3,1)-(3,2). Best move: go to (3,0) — max distance east along bottom row, away from allies to the north, and the enemies are at y=1-2 so I'm skirting the southern edge away from them.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,0) ✓ → move(2,0) ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,0) and is the enemy damage dealer (specter). I'm at 4/4 HP. Breach is unavailable (2/2 used). Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best play: use shadow_strike on Wraith for 1 damage while staying safe, then move to (2,0) to get behind Wraith for a better position next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both allies are at full HP, so patch is useless this turn. No adjacent allies to overclock either. Wraith is 2 tiles away at (3,0) - a threat. I should reposition safely. Moving to (3,4) keeps distance from Wraith and stays central. No useful ability to use, so wait as second action.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(3,5) ✓ → precision_shot(1,5) ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is wounded and in range at dist=3. I'm at (4,5), Snare at (1,5) — that's exactly 3 tiles, within my range of 2... wait, precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Dist=3 is out of range for precision_shot. Snare is also 3 tiles away so I cannot use precision_shot from current position. I need to move closer but must NOT go adjacent (dist=1). Moving to (3,5) puts me at dist=2 from Snare at (1,5) — that's in range and not adjacent. But I didn't move before shooting so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Snare is wounded so this could secure the kill.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,5) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,5) with 3/7 HP, Bolt is 2 tiles away at (3,5) - within my range 2 attack. I should attack Bolt for 1 damage, then move to safer ground. Moving to (0,4) puts me further from Bolt while staying useful. Alternatively, I can place a trap along the enemy approach path. Patch is at (3,4) and Bolt at (3,5) - placing a trap at (2,4) or (2,5) would intercept their approach. Let me attack Bolt first, then place a trap at (2,4) to cover the path.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Enemy cluster is to the northeast - Patch at (3,4), Bolt at (3,5), Phantom at (2,0). Moving to (2,3) gets me closest to the enemy cluster while staying central. From there I can shield_wall facing North/East toward the enemy cluster. Snare is wounded at (1,5) - shield_wall facing N from (2,3) won't help them much. Best move: advance to (2,3), then shield_wall facing E toward the enemy cluster.
  State: Bolt 3/4, Phantom 4/4, Patch 9/9, Wraith 3/4, Snare 3/7, Bastion 12/12

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is adjacent at (3,0), I'm already behind them (they face E, I'm at (2,0) which is their west/behind). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage. I'll use shadow_strike on Wraith to chip damage while staying invisible.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward map edge, away from enemies. I'm at (3,0) facing E. Phantom is at (2,0) to my west — moving east along the bottom row gets me away from both allies and enemies. Valid moves include (4,0), (5,0) which are on the south edge. I'll move to (5,0) to maximize distance from all threats.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(1,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is wounded and at distance 2 — within precision_shot range. I'm not adjacent to Snare so no suppression block. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Snare is wounded so this likely finishes it. I'll fire first then stay put to maintain range.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(3,5) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded at 3/4 HP and adjacent to me at (3,5). I have 1 heal remaining. Priority is to heal Bolt. I'm at (3,4), Bolt is at (3,5) — that's adjacent. I can patch Bolt first, then consider positioning. Bastion is at (2,3), dist=2, not a threat this turn. Snare is at (1,5), dist=3, so I must avoid moving adjacent to it. After healing Bolt, I'll move to (4,4) to stay safe and position behind allies.
- **Snare** (vector): move(0,5) ✓ → trap(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — critical danger. Bolt is only 2 tiles away and healthy. I need to survive. Moving to (0,5) puts me at edge, maximizing distance from Bolt. I already have a trap at (2,4). I can place another trap at (2,5) to block Bolt's approach path along row 5, then retreat west.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Bolt is at (3,5) dist=3, Phantom at (2,0) dist=3, Patch at (4,4) dist=3. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to the enemy cluster (Bolt+Patch). Traps at (2,4) and (2,5) - avoid those. From (4,3) I'd be adjacent to Patch at (4,4) for an attack. Move to (4,3), then attack Patch.
  State: Bolt 4/4, Phantom 4/4, Patch 7/9, Wraith 2/4, Snare 1/7, Bastion 12/12

### Turn 7 — player
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,0) with 2HP, facing East. Phantom is at (2,0) facing South — closest enemy at dist 3, but I can only move 3 tiles and need to get behind them (tile 2,1). My reachable tiles are [3,0],[3,1],[4,0],[4,1],[4,2],[5,1],[5,2],[5,3]. I can move to (3,0) which gets me to dist 1 from Phantom, but I need to be at (2,1) to be behind them — that's not in my valid moves. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer. With 2HP I'm fragile. No enemies in range currently. Best play: move to (3,0) to close distance on Phantom, setting up a shadow_strike next turn. I can't reach behind Phantom this turn.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,0) ✓ → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 Wraith is wounded and adjacent at (3,0). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage — if Wraith is wounded that may finish them. I'm at (2,0) facing S, Wraith is at (3,0). Shadow_strike is adjacent-only, so I can use it from current position. Then move to (4,0) to get behind Wraith in case they survive, or reposition for next turn.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,5) ✓ → precision_shot(0,5) ✓
  💭 Snare (vector) is critical and in range at dist=3, but my range is ≤2 tiles for precision_shot. Snare is 3 tiles away — out of precision_shot range. Bastion is also dist=3, out of precision_shot range. Neither enemy is within my ≤2 tile ability range. I should move closer to get Snare in range, but must avoid going adjacent to Snare (vector denial). Snare is at (0,5), I'm at (3,5). Moving to (2,5) puts me at dist=2 from Snare — within precision_shot range and not adjacent. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Snare is critical so this could finish it.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses remaining). Bastion is adjacent at (4,3) - I'm at (4,4). I have overclock available but Bastion is an enemy sentinel, not an ally. My wounded ally Bolt is at (2,5), dist=3, not reachable this turn. Bastion (enemy) is adjacent and healthy. I should reposition safely - moving behind/beside Bastion doesn't help since Bastion is an enemy. The orders say position safely behind my sentinel, but Bastion is an enemy. I should move away from the enemy Bastion to avoid being attacked. Moving to (5,5) puts distance between me and Bastion. I can't heal anyone this turn. I'll move to (5,5) to reposition away from the enemy, then wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,3) with full HP. Enemies are at dist 3-4, none in melee range. Ally Wraith is critical at (3,0). Orders say push forward aggressively. Phantom is at (4,0) dist 3 - moving toward them. If I move to (4,5) I get closer to Bolt/Patch cluster. Actually, orders say shield_wall facing enemy cluster. The enemy cluster is to the north (Bolt at 2,5, Patch at 5,5, Phantom at 4,0). Moving north toward them while shield_walling. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent area toward the top enemies. Let me move to (4,5) - closer to Bolt and Patch. Then shield_wall facing N toward the enemy cluster at top.
  State: Bolt 3/4, Phantom 4/4, Patch 7/9, Wraith 1/4, Bastion 12/12 | Dead: Snare

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Wraith is critical and adjacent at (3,0), I'm already behind them (they face W, I'm at their east). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. With Wraith at critical HP, one shadow_strike should finish them off.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at distance 2, which is max range for precision_shot. I'm at 3/4 HP, not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. No wounded enemies, so target Bastion as the only enemy in range. Stay in current position to maintain max range.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bolt is wounded at 3/4 HP but is 3 tiles away, not adjacent. Bastion (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (4,5). I cannot use patch anyway, and overclock requires adjacency to an ally - no allies are adjacent. I should move away from Bastion to safety since I have no healing left and being adjacent to an enemy is dangerous. Moving to (5,4) gets me away from Bastion while staying on the board.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,5) ✓ → attack(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,5) with no enemies in attack range. Bolt is at (2,5) dist=2 and Patch is at (5,4) dist=2. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. The enemy cluster is to my west (Bolt at 2,5) and south-ish (Patch at 5,4). Moving to (3,5) gets me adjacent to Bolt for an attack. After moving I lose Fortify, but I can attack Bolt. Alternatively I can move west toward Bolt at (3,5) and then attack. Let me move to (3,5) which puts me adjacent to Bolt at (2,5), then attack.
  State: Bolt 2/4, Phantom 4/4, Patch 7/9, Bastion 11/12 | Dead: Wraith, Snare

### Turn 9 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,5) distance 6, out of range. No enemies in range. Breach unavailable. I need to close the gap. Move toward Bastion to get into striking range next turn. Best path: move to (3,2) to close distance significantly.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bolt is wounded at 2/4 HP but is 4 tiles away - can't reach to heal or overclock. Bastion is 3 tiles away, no enemies adjacent. Best move is to reposition toward Bolt to potentially overclock next turn, moving to (4,5) to close distance while staying safe behind Bastion's position.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → move(1,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at dist=1. precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Bastion is a sentinel, not a Vector — however, the rules say precision_shot needs LoS and is 2dmg at range≤2 tiles, but WARNING says it's blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically. Bastion is sentinel, not vector, so precision_shot should work. BUT I'm at 2HP and adjacent to Bastion which is dangerous. Orders say never move adjacent to enemies. I'm already adjacent. Valid moves include [1,5], [0,5], [1,4], [2,4], [2,3], [3,4]. I need to move away first to get to range 2 from Bastion. Moving to [1,5] puts me at dist=2 from Bastion at [3,5] — that's range 2, still in range for precision_shot. Move to [1,5] first, then fire precision_shot on Bastion. But wait — if I moved, precision_shot does 1dmg instead of 2dmg. Alternatively, fire precision_shot first (2dmg) while still at current position (dist=1, in range), then move away. Dist=1 means I'm adjacent but Bastion is sentinel not Vector, so precision_shot isn't blocked. Fire first for 2dmg, then move to [1,5] to escape.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) E ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent at (4,5) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Patch first, then shield_wall facing East to protect against Patch/Bolt cluster.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is at (3,5), distance 3, out of range for shadow_strike. Breach unavailable. I need to close in. Moving north gets me adjacent to Bastion. Valid moves include (3,4) which puts me at distance 1 from Bastion at (3,5). Then I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Patch** (medic): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Bolt is wounded at 2/4 HP but is 3 tiles away and I can't reach them. Bastion (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (3,5). I need to move away from Bastion to avoid being in melee range. I can move to (5,5) or (5,4) to create distance. Overclock could help Bolt or Phantom but neither is adjacent. Best play: move to (5,4) to get distance from Bastion, then wait since no allies are adjacent for overclock and patch is gone.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is at distance 2, within precision_shot range. I'm at (1,5) and not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. Bastion is healthy but is the only enemy in range. Orders say to use precision_shot on most wounded enemy; since Bastion is the only target, I'll shoot Bastion. I haven't moved this turn so precision_shot deals full 2 damage. Stay at current position to maintain max range.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) S ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,4) - attack it immediately. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction, but attacking won't break fortify since I haven't moved. After attacking Phantom, use shield_wall facing South to protect against the enemy cluster coming from that direction. Bolt is at (1,5) to my west, Phantom at (3,4) to my south, Patch at (5,4). The main threat cluster is to my south/southwest. Shield_wall facing W or S makes sense - Bolt is W at dist 2, Phantom is S at dist 1. Attack Phantom first since it's in range, then shield_wall facing S toward the cluster.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,5) ✓ → move(4,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,5). I'm cloaked and should stay cloaked while dealing damage. Shadow_strike keeps cloak active and deals 1 damage. I can move to (4,5) to get behind Bastion first, then shadow_strike, or just shadow_strike now from current position. Moving to (4,5) gets me behind Bastion but doesn't change damage output. Better to shadow_strike now to deal damage while cloaked, then reposition behind for next turn.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → overclock(4,5) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Bolt is wounded at (1,5) but dist=5, unreachable. Phantom is wounded at (4,5) dist=2, adjacent would be (4,5) but I can't heal. Best I can do is move toward Phantom at (4,4) to be adjacent for overclock - giving Phantom an extra action could help. Bastion is at (3,5) dist=3, not adjacent to me so no Vector blocking concern. Move to (4,4) to be adjacent to Phantom at (4,5), then use overclock on Phantom who is a fast specter that can deal damage.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at distance 2, exactly at max range. I'm at (1,5) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Target Bastion to secure the kill.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(4,5) ✓ → shield_wall(4,5) E ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,5) and wounded — I can attack for 1 damage. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is valuable. Attack Phantom first, then shield_wall facing East to block the enemy cluster (Phantom, Patch both to my east). Moving would break Fortify, so stay in place.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,5) behind Bastion at (3,5) facing W — I'm already in the perfect behind position. I have 1HP and overclocked (2 ability uses). Breach is unavailable. I'll use shadow_strike twice to eliminate Bastion — shadow_strike deals 1dmg, keeps cloak, and works at adjacent range. Bastion is wounded so 2 hits should finish them.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded at distance 2, within precision_shot range. I'm at (1,5) not adjacent to any enemy Vector, so precision_shot is available. Stay in place and fire to secure the kill.
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(4,5) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 remaining). Phantom is adjacent at (4,5) with 1HP critical - I can use overclock on Phantom to give them 2 abilities next turn, which could be powerful for a specter. Bastion sentinel enemy is at (3,5) dist=2. Phantom at (4,5) is adjacent to me. I'll overclock Phantom first, then move to (5,4) to stay safe and away from Bastion.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(2,5) ✓ → attack(1,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with 3/12 HP, fortified. Bolt is wounded at (1,5) distance 2 — moving to (2,5) puts me adjacent to attack. But I'm at low HP. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move to (2,5) to get adjacent to Bolt and attack. Losing fortify is a risk at 3HP but orders are aggressive and Bolt is wounded.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): move(0,5) ✓ → precision_shot(2,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot for Striker (WARNING: precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector — actually that's Vector, but Bastion is a sentinel adjacent to me). Let me re-check: precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector specifically. Bastion is a sentinel, not Vector, so precision_shot should work. But wait — Bastion is at dist=1 (adjacent), and precision_shot requires range ≤2 tiles with LoS. Adjacent is within range. However, orders say never move adjacent to enemies — I'm already adjacent. I should move away first to get to range 2, then use precision_shot. Valid moves include [0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[2,4],[3,5]. Moving to [0,5] or [0,4] puts me at dist=2 from Bastion at (2,5) — that's safe range. Move to (0,5) first, then precision_shot Bastion who is critical — secure the kill.
- **Patch** (medic): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0/3 uses left). Bolt is critically wounded at 1HP but is 6 tiles away — I cannot reach them. Bastion is the enemy sentinel at critical HP, dist 4. I have no healing to offer and no allies adjacent to overclock. Best play is to reposition safely — move toward allies while staying out of danger. I'll move toward (4,5) to be closer to the action.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,5) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP and critical. Bolt is at (0,5) distance 2 to my west. If I move to (1,5), Bolt is adjacent and I can attack. But at 2HP I'll likely die. Orders say push aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. If I move west to (1,5), Bolt is adjacent west of me. I could shield_wall facing W to block Bolt's attacks. But fortified means 50% dmg reduction if I didn't move. At 2HP, staying fortified might keep me alive one more turn. However orders say push forward aggressively. Staying put: no attack possible (enemies out of range). Moving to (1,5) gets me adjacent to Bolt for attack, but loses fortify and I'm at 2HP. Shield_wall from (1,5) facing W could protect myself... but shield_wall protects adjacent ALLIES, not self. With only 2HP, moving into melee with Bolt is suicidal. Best play: stay fortified, use shield_wall facing W to protect any ally that might be nearby, or wait to preserve fortify bonus for defense.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion is critical and at distance 2 — exactly in range for precision_shot (2dmg). I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. This should finish Bastion. Stay put to avoid moving adjacent to any enemy.
- **Patch** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Bolt is wounded at (0,5) but dist=4, not adjacent. Bastion is at dist=2, not adjacent so no threat to abilities. I have no heals left and can't reach Bolt this turn. Best play is to move toward Bolt to potentially overclock them next turn, or move safely. Bolt has 1HP - critical. I should move toward Bolt. From (4,5) with mv2, I can reach (3,5) or further. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to Bolt at dist=3. Can't reach Bolt this turn. Wait as second action.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,5) ✓ → shield_wall(3,5) E ✓
  💭 At 1HP, I'm critical. Fortified gives 50% damage reduction which is my only survival tool. Patch is adjacent at (3,5) — attacking it denies healing to enemies. Moving would lose fortify and my only defense. I'll attack Patch and use shield_wall facing East toward the enemy cluster to protect against further damage.
