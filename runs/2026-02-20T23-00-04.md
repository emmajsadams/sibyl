## Squads
### Player
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Doc** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
- **Insight** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
### Opponent
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Shade** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is exactly at scan range (dist=4). I should scan it now to reveal its prompt and deal 1 damage. No need to move first — Shade is already in range from my current position. After scanning, I'll hold position.
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(4,4) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and TIP. All enemies are 4-6 tiles away, no threats adjacent. I'll cloak first, then move south toward Insight at (4,0) to close distance while invisible.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range (dist=6 > 4). I need to advance to get within scan range. Moving south toward (3,2) gets me closer to enemies while staying behind allies. After moving, enemies will still be out of range this turn, so I'll wait as second action.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Closest enemy is Insight at dist=5, need to close to range 2. Move toward (4,3) to reduce distance to Insight at (4,0) — that gets me to dist=3, still out of range 2. Move to (5,2) gets me dist=4 from Insight. Best move is toward (4,3) to get closer. From (4,3), Insight at (4,0) is dist=3, still out of range 2. No valid move gets me in range this turn. Move to (4,3) to advance, then wait.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, no allies are wounded. No enemies in range. I should advance toward the frontline to be in position to heal Warden when needed. Moving to (2,2) closes distance to allies while staying behind them.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,0) with no enemies in range. Orders say push forward aggressively. I should advance toward the enemy cluster. Lens is at (3,2) dist=3, Marksman at (4,3) dist=5. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer to both enemies and positions me centrally. Then I'll use shield_wall facing North to protect allies Doc and myself from the enemy cluster above.
  State: Warden 12/12, Insight 8/8, Doc 9/9, Marksman 4/4, Shade 3/4, Lens 8/8

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(4,0) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Doc (dist=1) which blocks scan? No, scan is blocked by adjacent enemy Vector, not medic. Doc is a medic, not a vector. Warden is a sentinel. I need to scan priority targets. Insight is the enemy oracle at dist=3 - scanning them reveals their strategy and deals 1 damage. I should move away from Doc/Warden first to avoid being adjacent, then scan Insight. Moving to (3,3) puts me at dist=3 from Insight still in range, and away from adjacent enemies. Actually I can scan from current position since no enemy Vector is adjacent. Scan Insight first (highest priority - reveals enemy oracle strategy + 1 dmg), then move to (3,3) to reposition safely behind allies.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → breach(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer and use breach on sentinels. Insight (oracle) is the damage dealer. I can't get behind Insight (no behind tiles reachable). Doc is the medic - getting behind Doc at (2,1) is possible. Warden (sentinel) is at (3,1) - I can get behind it at (3,0) for breach. My priority: breach the Warden to neutralize their defensive ability, then position for Insight. Move to (3,0) to get behind Warden, then breach.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(5,1) ✓ → scan(3,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (3,0) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not a Vector, so scan should work. However, I already know Shade's prompt from a previous scan. Lens is at dist=4 and is a high-value target to scan (reveal their prompt). But Shade is adjacent (dist=1) which means I'm in danger — Shade will likely attack or assassinate me. I should move away from Shade first. Moving to (5,1) puts me at range 2 from Shade and still within scan range of Lens at (3,3) — dist would be sqrt(4+4)~2.8, no wait: dist from (5,1) to (3,3) = |5-3|+|1-3| = 2+2 = 4 (Manhattan), still in range. From (5,1), Marksman at (4,3) is dist=1+2=3, still in range. Move to (5,1) then scan Lens at (3,3) to reveal their prompt — Lens is the enemy oracle, knowing their orders will help our team counter.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Insight is wounded at 7/8 HP but is 4 tiles away — too far to reach and heal this turn. Warden is at full HP, no heal needed. No allies adjacent. Lens is at dist=2, I should avoid getting closer to enemies. Best play: move toward Insight to close distance for a future heal, staying safe behind Warden.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so orders say to target the enemy medic (Doc). Doc is at (3,2), dist=2, within precision_shot range. I'm at (4,3) with full HP. I should not move (staying at max range and not moving preserves full precision_shot damage). Fire precision_shot on Doc at (3,2).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, facing away from the team. Allies are at (5,1) and (3,2). Moving to (2,0) puts me at the bottom-left edge, away from allies, facing south (away from team which is to the north/east).
  State: Warden 12/12, Insight 7/8, Doc 7/9, Marksman 4/4, Shade 3/4, Lens 7/8

### Turn 3 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Doc is adjacent (dist=1) at (3,2) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Doc is a medic not a Vector, so scan should work. However, Doc is at dist=1 which is within scan range. Foresight shows Insight just scanned me at (3,3), so I know their position. Doc moved to (3,2) and waited — they're right next to me and a priority target. Scanning Doc reveals their prompt AND deals 1 damage. After scanning Doc, I should move away to maintain range and avoid being adjacent to enemies. Moving to (3,4) keeps distance from Doc and Warden while staying in range for future scans.
- **Shade** (specter): move(5,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Insight (oracle) is the priority target. I can reach (5,0) which is behind Insight — adjacent and behind. Breach is on cooldown (1 turn remaining), so I can't use it. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1 damage. Move to (5,0) to get behind Insight, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → scan(4,3) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent at (5,0) — dangerous specter who will try to assassinate damage dealers. I should scan Marksman for intel since I don't have their prompt yet, and that's a valid target at dist=3. But Shade is adjacent, which blocks scan per the rules. I need to move away from Shade first to enable scan. Moving to (4,2) puts me dist=2 from Shade (no longer adjacent), dist=2 from Marksman — still in scan range. Then I can scan Marksman to reveal their strategy and deal 1 damage.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Insight (oracle) is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot (Vector rule doesn't apply here, Insight is an oracle not a Vector). Wait - the warning says precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, not oracle. So I can use precision_shot on Insight at dist=1. No enemies are wounded, so I should target the enemy medic (Doc) per orders. Doc is at dist=2, in range. I should move first to avoid being adjacent to Insight - move to (5,3) or (5,4) to maintain range while keeping Doc in range. From (5,3), Doc at (3,2) would be dist=3 which exceeds range 2. From (4,4), Doc at (3,2) is dist=3, also out of range. From (5,2), Doc at (3,2) is dist=2, in range, and Insight at (4,2) is dist=1 - still adjacent. From (4,1), Insight at (4,2) is dist=1 - adjacent again. Best: stay at (4,3) and shoot Doc with precision_shot (dist=2, in range, no movement so full 2dmg). Insight being adjacent doesn't block precision_shot (that's only Vector). Actually re-reading: 'precision_shot blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector' - Vector is a class? No, it seems like a unit name/class. The warning mentions 'enemy Vector' as a proper noun. Since there's no Vector unit in this game, I can use precision_shot freely. Target Doc the medic at (3,2) with precision_shot for 2 damage.
- **Doc** (medic): patch(4,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Insight is wounded at HP 6/8 and is at (4,2), adjacent to my current position (3,2). I should patch Insight to heal them. After healing, I can move to stay safe or wait. No enemies are adjacent so overclock is blocked by proximity rules - actually, overclock is blocked by adjacent enemy Vectors specifically. No enemies adjacent to me. But my orders say patch frontliner - Insight is the wounded ally. Let me move to (4,2)... wait, Insight is at (4,2) and I'm at (3,2), that's distance 1, so they ARE adjacent. I can patch them from here. After patching, I'll move to a safer position.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the map edge, facing away from the team. Allies are to my north/northeast. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer to the east edge and away from allies. I'll face east (away from team). No ability needed.
  State: Warden 12/12, Insight 8/8, Doc 4/9, Marksman 3/4, Shade 3/4, Lens 7/8

### Turn 4 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,0) ✓ → breach(4,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,0) facing E, Warden is at (4,0) adjacent. I can move to (3,0) which is directly behind Warden (facing E, so behind is W side). From (3,0) I'm adjacent and behind — perfect for breach. Breaching Warden breaks their defensive posture and wastes their turn. Doc is wounded and priority, but I can't reach behind Doc. Breach Warden from behind at (3,0) to neutralize the sentinel threat.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(5,3) ✓
  💭 Both Insight and Doc are already scanned. Warden is out of range. I should recalibrate Marksman to boost effectiveness, then hold position. Marksman is at (5,3), which is adjacent? No, distance is |5-3|+|3-4|=3, not adjacent. Recalibrate requires adjacent only. Shade is at (3,0), distance=4, not adjacent. No allies are adjacent. I could move to (4,3) to be adjacent to Marksman at (5,3) — dist would be 1 — then I can't recalibrate this turn since move+ability. Wait, I can move first then recalibrate. Move to (4,3) puts me at distance 1 from Marksman at (5,3). That's adjacent! Then recalibrate Marksman. But moving to (4,3) also puts me closer to enemies. Insight is at (4,2) — that's adjacent to (4,3), and Insight is an oracle (not a vector), so scan isn't blocked. Actually I should scan Doc who is wounded — at dist 4 from current pos, already scanned. Better to recalibrate Marksman: move to (4,3), recalibrate Marksman at (5,3) with tactical addendum to focus fire on Doc to finish them off.
- **Insight** (oracle): recalibrate(4,1) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no scan value left. Lens is adjacent at (4,3) which blocks my scan ability anyway, and is a priority threat. I can't attack at range (attack is adjacent only) and Lens is adjacent. I should reposition away from Lens to avoid the scan-block, then recalibrate Doc who is wounded at (4,1) — Doc is adjacent to my current position. Actually, recalibrate requires adjacent target. If I move first, I may lose adjacency to Doc. Better: recalibrate Doc first (adjacent at 4,1), then move away from Lens toward safer position like (3,3) to maintain range advantage.
- **Doc** (medic): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP (Warden 12/12, Insight 8/8), so no healing needed this turn. Warden is my frontline anchor at (4,0) adjacent to me. Shade is at (3,0) dist=2, Lens at (4,3) dist=2 — both out of range. Orders say avoid (5,0)-(5,1) flank area. I should try to overclock Warden to boost our frontliner, but overclock requires adjacency and takes 1 dmg to Warden — Warden is healthy at full HP so this is fine. Wait, overclock damages the TARGET (Warden takes 1dmg). Warden is at 12/12, so losing 1 is acceptable. Actually orders say overclock striker or specter when no healing needed, not sentinel. Shade is a specter but is an enemy. No allied striker or specter is adjacent. Insight is oracle at dist=3, not adjacent. So I can't overclock anyone useful. Best move: stay put or reposition to maintain adjacency with Warden. Wait to conserve and stay covered.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded and in range at dist=3, but precision_shot requires ≤2 tiles. Doc is at (4,1), I'm at (5,3) — that's distance 3, out of precision_shot range. Insight is at (3,3), dist=2, in range for precision_shot. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so no Vector blocking. Orders say finish Doc first, but Doc is out of range. I need to move closer to Doc. Moving to (5,1) puts me at dist=2 from Doc at (4,1) — x diff=1, y diff=0, so dist=1, well in range. From (5,1) I can precision_shot Doc. Check: (5,1) is a valid move tile. After moving to (5,1), Doc at (4,1) is adjacent (dist=1), which is ≤2 range. No enemy Vector present to block. Fire precision_shot on Doc to eliminate the healer.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,0) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move east toward the edge. Valid moves include (5,0) which is east. I'll attack Shade first since they're adjacent, then move east.
  State: Warden 12/12, Insight 8/8, Doc 3/9, Marksman 3/4, Shade 2/4, Lens 7/8

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(5,0) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Insight is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks scan per Vector rule — wait, Insight is an oracle not a Vector, so scan is NOT blocked. I've already scanned Insight and Doc. Warden is at dist=4, in scan range and not yet scanned — high value target. I should scan Warden to reveal their prompt. Then recalibrate Marksman or move to better position. Insight is adjacent at (3,3) — I should move away to avoid being adjacent to enemies. Move to (5,3) to maintain range and stay behind allies, then scan Warden at (5,0) dist=3 from there... wait, let me check: from (5,3) to (5,0) = dist 3, still in range. Actually I can move first then scan. Or scan first from current position (dist=4, valid) then move. Scan Warden first from current pos (dist=4, just in range), then move to (5,3) to stay safe.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → recalibrate(4,1) ✓
  💭 All three enemies already scanned — no new scan value. Doc is wounded and Marksman will precision_shot Doc again next turn. I should recalibrate Doc to help them survive, or recalibrate an ally. Doc is at (4,1), adjacent range only. I'm at (3,3), Doc is 3 tiles away — not adjacent. I can move toward Doc first. Move to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Doc at (4,1). Then recalibrate Doc with tactical advice to reposition away from Marksman's fire. This protects our medic.
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP and breach is exhausted. Warden is 2 tiles away at (5,0) facing E — I can reach (4,0) which is directly behind them. From there I can shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Doc is wounded and nearby but not reachable behind. Priority: move to (4,0) behind Warden, then shadow_strike for 1 damage.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(4,1) ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded and at (4,1) — distance 1, so adjacent. precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I must move first to (3,1) to get distance 2 from Doc, then use precision_shot for 2 damage to finish them off. At (3,1), Doc at (4,1) is dist=1... still adjacent. Only valid moves are (3,1) or (5,2). Moving to (5,2) puts me at dist=2 from Insight at (4,2) and dist=2 from Doc at (4,1) — not adjacent to any enemy. From (5,2): Doc at (4,1) is dist=2 (not adjacent), so precision_shot works. Use precision_shot on Doc to eliminate the medic.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → patch(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 2/9 HP — critically wounded. Shade is adjacent at (4,0), blocking patch due to Vector adjacency rule. Warden needs heal but is dist=2 and I need to approach. Orders warn against (5,1) area (Marksman's precision_shot). I should move away from Shade to break the block, then patch if possible. Moving to (3,1) gets me away from Shade and Marksman's fire lane. From (3,1) Shade is dist=2, no longer adjacent, so patch is unblocked. Warden at (5,0) would be dist=3 from (3,1) — too far to heal. Best play: move to (3,0) to get dist=1 from Warden at... wait, Warden is at (5,0), that's far. Let me check (3,1): dist to Warden(5,0) = |3-5|+|1-0| = 3, too far. What about self-heal? I can patch myself if not adjacent to enemy. At (3,1), Shade is dist=2, Marksman dist=2 — not adjacent, patch unblocked. Patch myself to survive (2HP→4HP). That's the priority — I'm critically low.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,0) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Orders say move east away from allies toward the edge. I'm at (5,0) already at the eastern edge (x=5 is max on 6x6 grid). Valid moves are [3,0], [4,1], [5,1]. Moving east isn't possible from x=5. Best interpretation: move toward edge while away from allies clustered around (3-4, 1-2). (5,1) keeps me on the eastern edge. Shade is adjacent at (4,0) and wounded — I can attack before or after moving. I'll attack Shade first, then move to (5,1) to stay on the eastern flank.
  State: Warden 10/12, Insight 8/8, Doc 5/9, Marksman 3/4, Shade 1/4, Lens 7/8

### Turn 6 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Breach is exhausted. Orders say assassinate enemy damage dealer. Doc is wounded and reachable via (4,1) which is behind them. But at 1HP, shadow_strike is safest since it keeps cloak if I had it. I'm not cloaked though. Doc at (3,1) is the wounded priority target — move to (4,1) puts me adjacent and behind Doc, then shadow_strike for 1dmg to finish them. That's the play: move to (4,1), shadow_strike Doc at (3,1).
- **Insight** (oracle): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is at critical HP and adjacent to me at (4,1) — this is a kill opportunity. However, scan is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Shade is a specter not a vector, so scan should work. Scanning Shade is already done. I should attack Shade to finish it off since it's critical. But wait — Warden already attacked (4,0) last turn and Marksman used precision_shot on (4,1) hitting Shade. Shade is critical. I can attack Shade at (4,1) for 1 damage to potentially finish it. Actually, I need to check: my attack range is adjacent only, and Shade is at (4,1) which is 1 tile away — within attack range. I should attack Shade to eliminate it, then move away from Marksman who is adjacent at (5,2). Move to (4,3) to get away from Marksman, then attack Shade first since I need to be adjacent. Current position (4,2), Shade at (4,1) is adjacent — attack first, then move to (3,2) to escape Marksman.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,1) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Lens will scan me and move to (5,3) — my current position. Lens is an enemy oracle at unknown location (not in enemies list, must be out of range or hidden). I've already scanned Warden and Insight. Doc is wounded and in range at dist 4. I should scan Doc to get their prompt confirmed (already have it but can deal 1 dmg), or better — scan Lens since they're targeting me. But Lens isn't in my enemies in range list, so I can't scan them. Doc is wounded and at dist 4 (max range). Scanning Doc deals 1 dmg to a wounded enemy — good value. After scanning, I should consider repositioning. Marksman is at (5,2) between me and Warden. Warden is moving east per their breached prompt. I'll scan Doc for damage, then stay put or reposition slightly.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded and priority target, but at dist=3 which is out of precision_shot range (max 2). Warden is adjacent at dist=1 — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel, not a Vector, so precision_shot should work. Insight is at dist=2 and healthy. I need to get Doc in range. Moving to (4,1) puts me at dist=2 from Doc at (3,1) but that's moving adjacent to Warden (5,1) — wait, (4,1) is dist=1 from Warden at (5,1), so Warden would be adjacent. Moving to (4,2) keeps distance from Warden and gets me closer. From (4,2), Doc at (3,1) is dist=2 (Manhattan: |4-3|+|2-1|=2), in range! And I wouldn't be adjacent to Warden at (5,1) — dist would be |4-5|+|2-1|=2, not adjacent. Move to (4,2) then precision_shot Doc.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → patch(3,1) ✗ No ally at target
  💭 I'm at 2/9 HP and need to prioritize survival. Warden is at (5,1) with 10/12 HP, wounded but not critical. I have 1 patch left. I'm being targeted by Marksman with precision_shot, so I must move away from exposure. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer to Warden and out of current position. From (4,0), Warden at (5,1) is distance 2 — not adjacent, can't patch. Moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Warden at (5,1)? No, dist from (4,1) to (5,1) = 1, adjacent! But Marksman is at (4,2), adjacent to (4,1) — that's dangerous, Vector blocks patch when adjacent to enemy. Wait — Marksman is a striker not a Vector. Only Vector blocks patch. So I can patch from (4,1). But moving to (4,1) puts me adjacent to Marksman at (4,2) — that's very risky at 2HP. Better to move to (3,0) or (2,1) for safety and use last patch on myself since I'm critically low at 2/9HP. Actually orders say patch Warden, but I'm at 2HP — I might die before helping. Let me move to (4,0) to get near Warden while repositioning, then patch Warden at (5,1)? Dist from (4,0) to (5,1) = sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent. Move to (4,1): adjacent to Warden(5,1), but adjacent to Marksman(4,2) too. Patch is not blocked by striker. I'll move to (4,1) and patch Warden — risky but follows orders. Actually at 2HP I'm nearly dead. Self-preservation: move away. Move to (2,1) keeps distance. But then I can't patch Warden. I'll move to (4,0) — safer than (4,1), still repositioning. Then wait since patch can't reach Warden from there.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move east away from allies toward the edge. I'm at (5,1) and can move to (5,0) or (5,2) or (5,3). Moving east means increasing x, but I'm already at x=5 (the edge). I'll move along the east edge — (5,3) gets me north along the edge, away from allies clustered around (3,0)-(3,2).
  State: Warden 10/12, Insight 8/8, Doc 2/9, Marksman 3/4, Lens 7/8 | Dead: Shade

### Turn 7 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(3,1) ✓ → recalibrate(3,0) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — no new intel value there. Marksman is adjacent (dist 1) which blocks scan anyway due to Vector warning... wait, Marksman is a striker not a vector. But I'm adjacent to Marksman at (4,2), and scan range is ≤4 tiles. Doc is critical at (3,0) and needs help, but I can't heal. Warden is healthy. Priority: I should recalibrate an ally or reposition. Lens is recalibrating our damage dealer per their prompt. I should back off from Marksman (who precision_shots wounded targets) since Doc is critical and I'm healthy — Marksman will target Doc. I can recalibrate Doc to help them succeed at patching, or recalibrate Warden. Actually best play: move away from Marksman to deny adjacency pressure, then recalibrate Doc (at range 1 from (3,0) if I move to (3,1)) to give tactical addendum. Move to (3,1) puts me adjacent to Doc for recalibrate. But Shade moved to (4,1) last turn — enemy specter nearby. Move to (2,1) to stay safer and maintain range, then recalibrate... Doc is at (3,0), from (2,1) that's dist 2 — not adjacent. Move to (3,1) to be adjacent to Doc and recalibrate them.
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(4,2) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Lens (ally oracle) is moving to my position (4,3) this turn. Shade moved to (4,1) and shadow_struck (3,1) — Insight is in danger. Marksman also used precision_shot on (3,1). Doc tried to patch (3,1) but failed. Insight at (3,1) is taking heavy fire. I should recalibrate Marksman to redirect fire, or scan a priority target. Warden is adjacent but already scanned. Insight is already scanned. Doc is at range 4 and critical — scanning Doc would reveal their prompt (already known). I'm adjacent to Warden (sentinel) — but Warden is not a Vector, so scan is not blocked by adjacency. Priority: Marksman needs coordination boost. I can recalibrate Marksman at (4,2) — adjacent! This will help Marksman focus fire. Then move away from Warden to avoid being stuck adjacent. Move to (3,3) to reposition, then recalibrate Marksman... wait, Marksman is at (4,2) which is adjacent to me at (4,3). I can recalibrate Marksman now. After recalibrating, I should move to safety away from Warden.
- **Doc** (medic): patch(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (2/9). No heals in range (Warden is dist=5, Insight is full HP). I have 1 patch remaining. Orders say stay at (3,0) and patch myself if possible. I can't reach Warden this turn. I should patch myself to survive — I'm the priority target for Marksman. Staying at (3,0) is fine since no enemies are adjacent and I'm not moving into open areas.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc is wounded and is their healer — eliminating them is top priority. Doc is at (3,0), dist=3, which is out of my range-2 precision_shot. Insight is at (3,1), dist=2, healthy but in range. Warden is at (5,3), dist=2, healthy. Orders say target wounded medic first, then Insight. Doc is out of range (dist=3). Insight is in range at dist=2 and I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I should stay put and fire precision_shot at Insight. No adjacent enemies so precision_shot is not blocked. I'll wait as second action.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=2, out of melee range. I need to close distance. Moving to (4,2) would put me adjacent to Marksman, but valid moves don't include (4,2) or (3,3). Moving to (4,3) gets me to dist=1 from Marksman at (4,2) — adjacent, in attack range. I'll move there then attack Marksman. Shield_wall is better when I'm stationary (Fortify bonus), but orders say push forward aggressively.

### Turn 8 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → recalibrate(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (4,3) — scan is blocked by adjacency only if it's a Vector, and Warden is a sentinel, not a Vector. However, Warden is already scanned. Insight is at (3,1), distance 2, healthy and already scanned. Doc at (3,0), distance 3, wounded and already scanned. All enemies in range are already scanned. Marksman (ally) is at (4,2) and Warden plans to attack them. I should recalibrate Marksman to help, but Marksman is at (4,2) — adjacent to my current position (3,3)? Distance = |4-3|+|2-3| = 1+1 = 2, not adjacent. Recalibrate requires adjacent only. I need to move to be adjacent to Marksman. If I move to (4,2)... wait that's Marksman's position. Move to (3,2) — distance to Marksman at (4,2) is 1, adjacent. Or move to (4,3) — that's Warden's position. Best: move to (3,2) to get adjacent to Marksman, then recalibrate Marksman. Marksman is wounded and about to be attacked by Warden. Recalibrate can give tactical addendum. Also, Warden is breached and moving east — should be less of a threat. Priority: recalibrate Marksman to help them deal damage or survive.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(2,1) ✓ → scan(4,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Marksman will precision_shot me at (3,1) this turn — I need to move first to dodge. Lens is adjacent at (3,2) which blocks my scan ability. Marksman is wounded and a priority kill target. I should move away from (3,1) to dodge the precision_shot, then scan Marksman (dist 2, in range) to deal 1 damage. Moving to (2,1) gets me out of Marksman's likely shot path and keeps Marksman in scan range (dist ~2). Lens will move to (3,3) per Foresight, so after I move to (2,1), Lens won't be adjacent and scan won't be blocked.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) with 1HP — critical condition. Warden is adjacent at (4,3) and will attack me. I must move away to survive. Moving west to (2,2) puts maximum distance from Warden. From (2,2), Insight at (2,1) is distance 1 — in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved adjacent to an enemy (Warden is at 4,3, far from 2,2). Insight is the highest-value target in range after moving. precision_shot at range 1 after moving deals 1dmg (moved penalty). Still worth it to apply pressure.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (5/9) with 0 heals remaining. Enemies are out of range. I need to survive. Lens is at (3,2) dist=2, Marksman at (2,2) dist=3. Orders say stay behind cover and avoid open areas. I can't heal anyone. No abilities useful without heals. Best move is to reposition away from enemy sight lines. Moving to (4,0) keeps me on the south edge, slightly further from Lens at (3,2). I can't overclock anyone since no allies are adjacent. I'll move to (4,0) to shift position slightly, staying on the bottom row for cover, then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,3) with 50% damage reduction. Lens is at (3,2) distance 2, Marksman at (2,2) distance 3. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. If I move to (3,3), I'll be adjacent to Lens at (3,2) and can attack. Doc at (4,0) is wounded and behind me. Moving to (3,3) puts me closer to the enemy cluster (Lens+Marksman are adjacent to each other). I'll move to (3,3) then attack Lens who is at (3,2) — directly south of that position.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): move(1,2) ✓ → scan(2,2) ✓
  💭 Marksman is critical and adjacent at (2,2) — scan is blocked when adjacent to enemies, but Marksman is a striker not a vector, so scan should work. Wait, the rule says scan blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector. Marksman is a striker, so scan is fine. Marksman is at critical HP — scan them to deal 1 damage and potentially finish them off (or bring them very low). Foresight shows Marksman will precision_shot me at (2,1) this turn. I should move first to avoid that shot. Move to (1,1) to break line of sight / range, then scan Marksman at (2,2) — dist from (1,1) to (2,2) is 2, within range 4. This deals 1 dmg to critical Marksman which may finish them, and reveals their prompt (already known). Actually scanning a target we already know wastes the intel benefit but still deals damage. Marksman at critical health — scan damage could eliminate them. Move to (1,2) first to stay away from Warden at (3,3), then scan Marksman.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Warden will attack me at (3,2) this turn. I need to move away from (3,2) to dodge that attack. Moving to (4,2) gets me away from Warden's attack range and keeps me at safe range. From (4,2), I can scan Doc (wounded, dist 3 from new pos) or recalibrate an ally. Insight is already scanned. Warden is already scanned and breached. Doc is scanned but wounded — could recalibrate a damage dealer instead. Foresight shows Insight will scan (4,2) — that's where I'm moving, but scan just reveals prompt, doesn't block me. I should move to (4,2) first to dodge Warden's attack, then scan Doc isn't needed (already scanned). Better to recalibrate Marksman if adjacent — but I don't know Marksman position. From (4,2), no new scan targets needed. I'll move to dodge Warden's attack, then wait or recalibrate. Actually, Marksman is on my team (mentioned in Doc's prompt). I should check if any ally needs recalibrate — recalibrate is adjacent only. Moving to (4,2) — who's adjacent? Need to recalibrate to help team. No clear adjacent ally target visible. I'll move to (2,1) to stay far from Warden, then scan — but all enemies are scanned. Move to (4,2) to dodge attack, then wait.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 5/9 HP, no patch uses left. Lens is 2 tiles away at (4,2). I need to avoid being a target. Orders warn about Shade's flank at (5,0)-(5,1). I can't heal anyone. Best move is to reposition away from danger - move to (3,0) to get some distance from Lens and away from the (5,x) danger zone. Then wait since I have no healing and no adjacent allies to overclock.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (4,2), distance 2 to my east-southeast. I can move to (4,3) to get adjacent and attack. Doc is wounded at (3,0) but Lens is the immediate threat. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Lens for an attack. Orders say push forward aggressively and attack when possible.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Insight** (oracle): scan(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens is at (4,2), distance 3, within scan range. I already know Lens's prompt. Warden attacked (4,2) last turn, so Lens may be damaged or repositioning. I should scan Lens again for damage intel or recalibrate Doc who is wounded. Actually, Doc is wounded — recalibrate is adjacent only so I can't reach Doc at (3,0). Best action: scan Lens to deal 1 damage (Lens is healthy, worth chipping). I'm at (1,2), Lens at (4,2), dist=3, within range 4. No enemy Vector adjacent so scan is not blocked. I'll scan Lens first, then consider moving closer or staying safe.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → scan(3,0) ✗ Out of range (max 4)
  💭 Foresight shows Warden will attack me at (4,2) this round. I'm at 4/8 HP and adjacent to Warden — dangerous. I should move away first to avoid the attack, then scan a target. Moving to (5,3) gets me away from Warden and keeps enemies in scan range. Doc is wounded and already recalibrated with bad info — scanning them again would waste an action since I already know their prompt. Insight is the enemy oracle and most dangerous — already scanned. I should recalibrate an ally if possible, but my ally Lens is at (4,2) which is where I currently am — they moved there per Foresight. After moving, I can scan Doc or wait. Actually, priority: move away from Warden to avoid the attack, then scan Insight again isn't useful (already known). Best use: move to safety, then wait or scan Doc to track their movement.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 5/9 HP with 0 heals remaining. No enemies in range. Warden is at (4,3) and Insight is at (1,2), both wounded but neither adjacent. I can't patch anyone. I should reposition toward Warden to support, but orders warn against open areas. Moving to (4,0) gets me closer to Warden and keeps me at the bottom edge for cover. Then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (5,3) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Lens to finish them off — they're in range right now. Stay in place to keep Fortify active, then attack.
  State: Warden 10/12, Insight 5/8, Doc 5/9, Lens 3/8 | Dead: Marksman, Shade

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 3HP, adjacent to enemy Warden who attacked me last turn. I need to escape — Warden is adjacent and will attack again. I can't scan while adjacent to enemy Vector, but Warden is a sentinel not a Vector, so scan should work. However, priority is survival: I'm at 3/8 HP. Move away from Warden first. Best escape: move to (5,5) or (4,5) to gain distance. Then scan Doc at (4,0) — already scanned. Insight is out of range. Warden already scanned. I should move away to safety then wait, or try to scan Doc again for damage. Actually Doc is already scanned. Let me move to (5,5) to escape Warden's melee range, then wait. Or I could move to (4,5) which puts me 2 tiles from Warden. Moving to (5,5) gives max distance. After moving, scan is blocked only by adjacent enemy Vectors — no vectors adjacent. But after moving to (5,5), Doc at (4,0) is dist=5+, out of range. Let me move to (4,4) — dist to Warden=1+1=2, and Doc at (4,0) would be dist=4, still in range for scan. Actually (4,5): dist to Warden = sqrt(0+4)=2, Doc dist = sqrt(0+25)=5 out of range. Move to (5,4): dist to Warden=2, Doc dist=sqrt(1+16)~4.1 out of range. Move to (5,5): safer. After moving, no good scan targets in range. I'll move to (5,5) and wait.
- **Insight** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → recalibrate(4,0) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (5,5), distance 7 — out of scan range (max 4). Insight (enemy oracle) is nearby at ~(4,2) based on foresight data. I need to close distance to get enemies in scan range. Moving toward (4,2) to approach Warden and get into scan range of enemies next turn. Doc is wounded at (4,0) — I could recalibrate Doc after moving closer.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 5/9 HP, patches are exhausted (0/3). Insight is at (4,2) dist=2, Warden at (4,3) dist=3 - neither adjacent. No enemies in range. I should move toward Insight to potentially overclock them next turn, while staying safe. Moving to (4,1) gets me closer to both allies without entering dangerous (5,x) territory. No healing available, so overclock is my only support option if I can get adjacent.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,4) ✓ → attack(5,5) ✓
  💭 Lens is at (5,5), distance 3. I need to push forward. Moving to (4,5) gets me closer and adjacent to (5,5) diagonally but still dist 2. Better: move to (5,4) puts me distance 1 from Lens at (5,5) — adjacent! Then I can attack. Let me check valid moves: (5,4) is valid. From (5,4), Lens at (5,5) is adjacent (1 tile north). Attack!
