Better to move west to (1,3) to escape Warden's melee range, then use shield_wall facing E to block if they follow, or just wait fortified. Actually, moving loses fortify and Warden could still reach me at (1,3) with mv2. Let me stay fortified and use shield_wall facing E to block Warden's attack — at 50% reduction a 1dmg attack becomes 0 (rounded down?). Staying fortified with shield_wall E is the safest play to survive this turn.",
