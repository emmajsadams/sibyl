## Squads
### Player
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
### Opponent
- **Deadeye** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak(5,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are far away (dist 6-8), no threats adjacent. After cloaking, advance south toward the enemy damage dealer (Marksman at 1,0). Moving to (5,2) gets me closer while staying on the flank.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemies are 7 tiles away, out of range. No medics visible. Priority targets are Deadeye (striker) then Rampart (sentinel). I should advance toward better position while maintaining distance per orders. Moving to (1,2) gets me closer without overextending, and keeps High Ground passive potential active.
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are at distance 5, out of my range 3. I need to advance to get them in range. Moving to (4,2) brings me closer while staying near cover. From there enemies are still at distance 3-4. Best move: advance to (4,2) to close distance, then wait since no targets in range yet.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) S ✓
  💭 Round 1, all enemies at distance 5. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move toward the enemy cluster (centered around x:2-3, y:0-2). Best advance is to (3,3) to close distance while staying central. Then shield_wall facing South (toward enemies at y:0-2 from my perspective moving down) — wait, enemies are south of me (lower y). I'm at (3,5) moving to (3,3). Enemies are at y:0-2, so they're to the south. Shield_wall facing S to protect allies Deadeye@(4,2) and Ghost@(5,2) from incoming fire.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) E ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=3, out of attack range. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy. Deadeye is at (4,2) and Rampart at (3,3) - both equidistant. Moving to (3,2) gets me closer to both and is within my valid moves. Then shield_wall facing E toward the enemies cluster.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,1) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies at distance 3. I should move forward and place a trap on a likely approach path. Deadeye is at (4,2) and Rampart at (3,3) — they'll likely advance south toward our backline. Moving to (3,1) puts me in good position while staying at medium range. I'll trap (3,2) to block the central corridor, but Aegis is there. Better to trap (4,1) to intercept Deadeye's likely advance path.
  State: Aegis 11/11, Marksman 4/4, Lattice 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Ghost 5/5, Rampart 11/11

### Turn 2 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. No enemies are reachable this turn for breach or shadow_strike. Priority is Marksman (enemy damage dealer) at (1,2). I need to close distance while staying cloaked. Moving to (4,1) gets me closer to the Marksman's south side and keeps distance from Lattice at (3,1) — but (4,1) is only 3 tiles from Lattice, not adjacent, so cloak is safe. From (4,1) next turn I can potentially reach behind Marksman at (1,1) or get adjacent for shadow_strike. Let me move to (4,1) to reposition toward the Marksman.
- **Deadeye** (striker): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. Lattice is 2 tiles away — moving adjacent would block abilities. I should move to (5,2) to gain distance from Aegis and Lattice, then use precision_shot on Marksman at (1,2) dist=3. From (5,2), Aegis is no longer adjacent so precision_shot is unblocked. Marksman is at dist=4 from (5,2) — out of range 3. Let me reconsider. From (4,3): Aegis at (3,2) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.4 tiles — still adjacent? Grid distance is Chebyshev or Manhattan? Likely Manhattan: |4-3|+|3-2|=2, so not adjacent. From (4,3), Aegis at Manhattan dist 2, Lattice at (3,1) Manhattan dist=3, Marksman at (1,2) dist=5 out of range. From (5,2): Aegis at |5-3|+|2-2|=2 not adjacent, Lattice at |5-3|+|2-1|=3 not adjacent, Marksman at |5-1|+|2-2|=4 out of range 3. From (5,1): Marksman at |5-1|+|1-2|=5 OOR. Best option: move to (5,2) to escape adjacency with Aegis, then precision_shot Aegis at (3,2) dist=2 for 2dmg since I moved (1dmg). Or attack Aegis first then move? Attack is adjacent only — Aegis is at dist=1 (adjacent). Attack Aegis for 1dmg, then move to (5,2). That's better — deal damage and reposition.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is a sentinel at dist=3, within precision_shot range. Orders say medics first then damage dealers — no medics visible, so target damage dealers. Deadeye is at dist=4, also in range. Rampart is closer and blocking. I'm at (1,2) with no adjacent enemies, so High Ground passive applies giving +1 range. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Target Rampart at (3,3) with precision_shot. No need to move — staying back maintains distance per orders.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent to the north at (3,3). Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I should attack Rampart. I'm currently fortified (didn't move last turn), so I'll attack first, then consider shield_wall. Most enemies are to the north/east. After attacking, I can use shield_wall facing north to protect allies from Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, adjacent to Aegis. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Aegis is at (3,2) directly south — I can attack it. Lattice is at (3,1) with denial range, so I must not move adjacent to it. I'll stay put to keep fortify bonus, attack Aegis, then shield_wall facing south to block damage from the Aegis/Lattice cluster.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(4,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Rampart is at (3,3), distance 2 — within trap range. I can place a trap at (3,2) which is between me and Rampart, but Aegis is there. Better to trap (4,2) to catch Deadeye approaching from the east, or trap (3,3) directly on Rampart... wait, trap goes on empty tile. Rampart is at (3,3) so that's occupied. (4,2) is empty and on the path Deadeye would take moving west. I'll trap (4,2) to deny that corridor. Then I could move to (4,1) to stay at medium range and maintain pressure, but I'm currently not adjacent to any enemy so trap isn't blocked by Denial restriction. Place trap at (4,2) first, then move to (4,1) to stay mobile.
  State: Aegis 9/11, Marksman 4/4, Lattice 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Ghost 3/5, Rampart 9/11

### Turn 3 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,2) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. I'm adjacent to Lattice (vector) whose denial zone blocks abilities — so I can't use shadow_strike or breach here. Priority is assassinating Marksman (striker = damage dealer). I can reach (1,1) which is behind Marksman and adjacent. Move to (1,1) first to escape denial zone and get behind Marksman, then shadow_strike for 2dmg while staying cloaked.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and in range at dist=4. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Lattice is exactly 3 tiles away — not adjacent, so no blocking. Marksman at (1,2) is 4 tiles away which exceeds precision_shot range of 3. Use suppressing_fire on Aegis at (3,2) to slow them, or try to reposition. Actually dist=4 to Marksman is out of precision_shot range (max 3). Aegis at dist=2 is in range. Best play: precision_shot Aegis for 2dmg (healthy, but 2dmg is solid). No movement needed — staying at (5,2) keeps distance from Lattice at (3,1).
- **Marksman** (striker): move(0,3) ✓ → precision_shot(1,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent (dist=1) at (1,1) which blocks precision_shot and is a wounded specter — priority target. I can't use precision_shot while adjacent. I should move away from Ghost first to enable precision_shot, then shoot Ghost to finish it off. Moving to (0,3) gets me away from Ghost and maintains distance from enemies. From (0,3), Ghost at (1,1) would be dist=2 — in range and no longer adjacent, so precision_shot works. Rampart at (3,3) is dist=3 from (0,3) and also in range but Ghost is wounded so finish it first.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent to the north at (3,3). Orders say attack if enemy is adjacent. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction. I'll attack Rampart, then use shield_wall facing north (toward Rampart/enemy direction) to protect allies.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,1) ✓ → attack(1,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost is wounded at (1,1) dist=2 and Rampart is at (3,3) dist=2, both in range. Ghost is the priority kill being wounded. I can pulse from current position to hit Ghost at dist=2 - wait, pulse is 1 tile AoE (range 1), Ghost is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach. I should attack Ghost or trap. Ghost is at (1,1), I'm at (3,1) - that's distance 2, within attack range? Attack is adjacent only (range 1), so no. I can trap to block paths. Rampart at (3,3) is coming south toward our backline. I should place a trap at (3,2) where Rampart will walk through - but Aegis is at (3,2), can't trap occupied tile. Trap at (2,2) or (4,2) - (4,2) already has a trap. Let me move to (2,1) to get adjacent to Ghost (dist=1) enabling Denial to block Ghost abilities, then I can attack Ghost. Moving to (2,1): Ghost at (1,1) is adjacent (dist=1), I can attack for 1dmg on wounded Ghost. But first action move, second action attack.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) to my south — I'm fortified and at range. Attack Aegis now, then shield_wall facing south to protect against the enemy cluster. Ghost is critical and to my west, but Lattice denial zone keeps me from moving adjacent. Stay put to keep fortify bonus.
  State: Aegis 7/11, Marksman 2/4, Lattice 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Ghost 1/5, Rampart 8/11

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(0,2) ✓ → breach(0,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely vulnerable. Lattice is adjacent at (2,1) with denial active, blocking my abilities except basic attack/movement. Priority: survive and eliminate Marksman (wounded, high threat). I can move to (0,2) which puts me behind Marksman at (0,3) — adjacent and behind for breach. But denial blocks breach if I'm adjacent to Lattice... I need to move away from Lattice first. Moving to (0,2) gets me distance from Lattice (dist=3) and puts me behind Marksman. From (0,2) I can breach Marksman — they're wounded so forcing them to waste their turn is huge. Breach cooldown is ready. This eliminates the denial zone issue since I'll be far from Lattice after moving.
- **Marksman** (striker): suppressing_fire(3,3) ✓ → move(0,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allied units and don't attack Ghost. Ghost is adjacent at (0,2). Allies are at (3,2) and (2,1). I need to move away from both Ghost and allies. Moving to (0,5) puts maximum distance from Ghost (dist=3) and allies. From (0,5), Rampart at (3,3) is dist=5, out of range. I can use suppressing_fire on Rampart from current position before moving since Rampart is at dist=3 and in range.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is at dist=2 (healthy sentinel, not priority). Marksman is wounded at dist=8, out of range. Lattice is a vector at dist=4 with denial range adjacent - need to keep distance. I haven't moved this turn so precision_shot is full power (2dmg). Aegis is in range at dist=2 (≤3). No adjacent enemies so High Ground passive applies (+1 rng). I'm not adjacent to Lattice so no precision_shot block. Priority: shoot Aegis with precision_shot for 2dmg since Marksman is out of range. Stay at current position to maintain range advantage.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent to the north at (3,3). Orders say to attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified (50% DR) which is good for survivability. I'll attack Rampart first, then use shield_wall facing north/east where enemies are clustered (Rampart N, Deadeye E). Attacking Rampart costs my ability slot, so I'll use shield_wall as second action facing E where Deadeye is.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,2) ✓ → pulse(1,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost is critical at (0,2) just 3 tiles away - a prime target. I can move to (1,2) to get within range 2 of Ghost at (0,2), then use pulse to hit Ghost (1 tile away from 1,2) for potential kill. Rampart is at (3,3) - moving toward center could threaten backline. I should also consider trapping (2,2) or (1,2) approach paths. Moving to (1,2) puts me adjacent to Ghost at (0,2), enabling pulse. But pulse hits ALL within 1 tile including allies - Aegis is at (3,2), not adjacent so safe. From (1,2), Ghost at (0,2) is distance 1 - pulse hits. This could finish off the critical Ghost. Let me move to (1,2) and pulse.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,2) W ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,2) — attack for free damage while staying fortified. Then shield_wall facing South to protect against the enemy cluster direction, or face North toward Aegis/Lattice cluster. I'm suppressed so movement is 1 tile. Staying put preserves Fortify (50% dmg reduction). Attack Aegis first, then shield_wall facing North to block incoming from that direction.
  State: Aegis 5/11, Marksman 2/4, Lattice 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Rampart 6/11 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 5 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded and at dist=2, within my range-3 precision_shot. I'm not adjacent to any enemy (Lattice is at dist=4), so no adjacency penalty. I have High Ground passive potentially. Fire precision_shot at Aegis to finish them off, then wait or hold position.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allied units and do not attack. Allies are at (3,2) and (1,2). I'm at (0,5). Moving to (2,5) increases distance from both allies while staying safe. No attack this turn.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) — attack them while fortified for survivability. I didn't move last turn so fortify is active. Attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing N to cover the northern approach where enemies are.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (3,3) wounded and approaching. Deadeye is at (5,2). I should move east to get closer and place a trap on likely approach path. Moving to (2,2) then trapping (3,2) - but Aegis is at (3,2). Better to move to (2,3) and trap (3,3) where Rampart is... but can't trap occupied tiles. Rampart will likely move toward our backline. I'll move to (2,2) and place a trap at (3,2) to block the corridor - wait, Aegis is at (3,2). Trap at (4,2) already exists. Best path: move to (2,3) to intercept Rampart's approach, then trap at (3,3) - Rampart is currently there so can't. Trap at (3,4) instead to cut off Rampart's retreat/advance routes. Or move to (2,1) and trap (3,1) to block southern approach.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,2) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, which is valuable. Aegis is adjacent to my south at (3,2) and wounded — attack is the priority. Lattice at (2,3) has denial active but that only blocks abilities, not basic attacks. I should stay put to keep fortify active, attack Aegis to potentially finish them off. Then use shield_wall facing south/west to protect against the enemy cluster. Actually, Deadeye is at (5,2) — I can shield_wall facing west (W) to cover from Lattice's direction. Attack Aegis first, then shield_wall facing W toward Lattice.
  State: Aegis 3/11, Marksman 2/4, Lattice 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Rampart 5/11 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 6 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is wounded and only 2 tiles away - perfect precision_shot target. I'm at (5,2) not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Fire at Aegis first, then hold position since moving would penalize future shots and I have no adjacency threats.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allied units and do not attack. Allies are at (3,2) and (2,3). I'm at (2,5). Moving to (0,5) puts maximum distance from both allies. Then wait since I'm not supposed to attack this turn.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent to the north at (3,3) and wounded. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm at 2HP so staying fortified (50% DR) is critical for survival. I should attack Rampart without moving to keep Fortify active. Deadeye is to the east at distance 2, so shield_wall facing E would help block incoming fire.
- **Lattice** (vector): pulse(2,3) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) - my Denial passive is blocking their abilities. They're wounded so I should finish them. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, so it will hit Rampart. Then I can move to set up better positioning. My allies Aegis is critical at (3,2) - Rampart is threatening them. Pulse Rampart now, then consider moving.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP with Fortify active (50% dmg reduction). Aegis is adjacent and critical — attack to finish them. Staying put preserves Fortify for survival. No move needed.
  State: Aegis 1/11, Marksman 2/4, Lattice 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Rampart 3/11 | Dead: Ghost

### Turn 7 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Aegis is critical and only 2 tiles away at (3,2). I'm at (5,2) with full HP. Precision_shot has range 3 and deals 2dmg — Aegis is in range and I haven't moved yet so no penalty. Fire first to eliminate Aegis, then wait or reposition. No adjacent enemies so precision_shot is not blocked.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,5) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Rampart at (3,3) is closer (dist=5) and wounded — priority target. I need to close distance. Moving to (2,5) gets me closer. From (2,5) Rampart is still at dist=4, still out of range (rng3 + High Ground = rng4 if no adj enemy). Let me recalculate: from (2,5) to (3,3) = |2-3|+|5-3| = 1+2 = 3. That's within range 3! Move to (2,5) then precision_shot Rampart at (3,3).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction — staying put preserves this. No enemies in melee range. Marksman is wounded at dist=3, Lattice is at dist=2. I can't attack either. Orders say shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Marksman is at (2,5) — north and west, Lattice at (1,3) — west. Primary threat cluster is to the west/northwest. Shield_wall facing W would protect allies from Lattice. I'll stay and shield_wall W to maintain fortify and block Lattice's attacks on allies.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → pulse(2,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is critical and adjacent at dist=2, within pulse range. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - but Rampart is at dist=2 so pulse won't reach. I can use attack on Rampart (dist=2, but attack is adjacent only so no). I should trap a path to deny Deadeye's approach. Move closer to Rampart to use pulse or stay and trap. Rampart is at (3,3), I'm at (1,3). Attack range is adjacent only (dist=1). Pulse is 1 tile AoE. If I move to (2,3), Rampart at (3,3) is dist=1 and I can pulse to finish it off. Then I'm in better position. Let me move to (2,3) and pulse - that hits Rampart at dist=1.
  State: Marksman 2/4, Lattice 6/6, Deadeye 4/4, Rampart 1/11 | Dead: Aegis, Ghost

### Turn 8 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at critical HP and only dist 3 away — precision shot will likely finish it. I'm not adjacent to any enemy so precision_shot is available. I'll shoot Rampart first, then wait. No need to move since Rampart is already in range.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice is a vector at (2,3), dist=4, in range. Marksman is wounded at (2,5) but out of range at dist=6. Priority is to shoot Lattice with precision_shot (2dmg) since it's in range. I'm at (5,2) not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. After shooting Lattice, I should stay put or reposition - staying at (5,2) keeps good range. I'll shoot Lattice first, then wait.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (5,2), dist 4. I already have traps at (4,2) and (3,4). Deadeye will likely advance toward our backline. I'm at (2,3) with 4HP. I should place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (3,3) keeps me at medium range and positions me better. From (3,3) I can place a trap at (4,3) or (3,2) to cover Deadeye's approach routes. (3,2) is a good chokepoint between the existing traps. Let me move to (3,3) then trap (4,3) to create a trap corridor with the existing (4,2) trap.
  State: Marksman 2/4, Lattice 4/6, Deadeye 4/4 | Dead: Aegis, Ghost, Rampart

### Turn 9 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at dist=6, out of my range-3 (plus High Ground bonus would give range 4, still not enough). No enemies in range currently. Valid moves include (4,5) which gets me closer. Moving to (4,5) reduces distance to Deadeye at (5,2) to about 4 tiles — still out of range. Best I can do is reposition closer while maintaining distance from any threats. Moving to (3,5) or (4,5) keeps me safe. I'll move to (4,5) to close distance, then wait since I still won't be in range.
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Marksman is wounded and in range at (4,5). I'm at (5,2) with 4 range via High Ground passive (no adjacent enemies). Distance to Marksman is 4 tiles — just at range. I should use precision_shot on Marksman for 2 damage to finish them off. Lattice is 3 tiles away at (3,3) — I must not move adjacent to Lattice or I lose precision_shot. Staying at (5,2) keeps me safe and in range. Fire first, then wait or hold position.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,4) ✓ → trap(5,3) ✓
  💭 Deadeye is at (5,2) heading east, dist 3. I have traps at (4,2), (3,4), (4,3) already placed. I'm at 4HP so need to be careful. Deadeye is a striker at speed 2 - they could close in. I should move to a better position and place another trap to block approach paths. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to center while staying away from existing traps. Then I can place a trap at (5,3) to block Deadeye's movement north, or place at (4,2) but that's already trapped. Let me place a trap at (5,3) to catch Deadeye if they move north. Wait - I need to check if I'm adjacent to enemy - Deadeye is dist 3 so trap is not blocked. Move to (4,4) first, then trap (5,3) to create a corridor of traps.
  State: Lattice 4/6, Deadeye 4/4 | Dead: Aegis, Marksman, Ghost, Rampart

### Turn 10 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (4,4), dist=3, healthy. I'm at (5,2) with full HP. I have a clear shot at range 3. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to Lattice so no blocking. Fire precision_shot first, then wait.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, very low. Deadeye is at (5,2) distance 3, not in range. I have traps at (4,2),(3,4),(4,3),(5,3) already placed covering many approach paths. I need to survive - move away from danger while placing another trap to further deny approach. Moving to (3,5) gets me further from Deadeye while staying on the field. Then I can place a trap at (4,5) or (5,4) to cover more paths. Actually, (5,3) already has a trap. Deadeye would likely move toward me. Let me move to (3,5) to create distance, then trap (4,4) my current position to punish any advance.
  State: Lattice 2/6, Deadeye 4/4 | Dead: Aegis, Marksman, Ghost, Rampart

### Turn 11 — player
- **Deadeye** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 Lattice is at (3,5), dist=5, out of my range 3 (or 4 with high ground). I need to close distance. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer while maintaining high ground potential. From (4,3), dist to (3,5) would be sqrt(1+4)=~2.2, so dist=3 — just in range for precision_shot. Let me verify: |4-3|+|3-5|=1+2=3 Manhattan distance. That's exactly range 3, so in range. Move to (4,3) then precision_shot Lattice.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,5) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,5) with only 1HP - extremely vulnerable. Deadeye is at (4,3) distance 3, out of range. There are already traps at (3,4) and (4,4) blocking some paths. I need to survive. Moving to (2,5) or (1,5) gets me away from Deadeye. I can't trap adjacent to enemies (not adjacent now, so trap is fine). Let me move away first to (2,5) then place a trap on (3,5) to cover my retreat path - wait, traps go on empty tiles within range 2. After moving to (2,5), I can trap (3,4) - already trapped. Let me trap (3,5) after moving away. Actually trap range is ≤2 tiles from position. If I move to (1,5), I can trap (2,4) or (3,5) to slow pursuit. With 1HP I must prioritize survival - move away from Deadeye.
  State: Lattice 1/6, Deadeye 2/4 | Dead: Aegis, Marksman, Ghost, Rampart
