Moving to (3,5) keeps distance from Viper and lets me scan Doc at range 4 (dist from 3,5 to 2,4 = 1+1=2, well in range). Actually Doc is already scanned. Bolt is out of range. I could scan Viper again? No — already scanned. I need to stay alive at 1HP. Best play: move away to increase distance from Viper, then wait or scan. Moving to (2,5) puts me 3 tiles from Viper (safe). From (2,5), Doc at (2,4) is distance 1 — I can attack Doc for 1 damage to finish them (attack is adjacent only). That would eliminate the enemy medic! Move to (2,5), then attack Doc at (2,4).",
