## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
### Opponent
- **Bolt** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
- **Doc** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. I should advance toward the front while staying behind my allies. Hawk is at (3,1) adjacent to me - I could overclock them but it costs me 1 HP and we're still far from enemies. Better to just reposition safely. Move to (3,2) to advance while keeping distance from enemies. No good ability targets yet.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, all allies at full HP so no healing needed. Enemies are 4-5 tiles away. I should advance toward my allies to support them. Moving to (3,4) keeps me near Warden (sentinel) for protection and positions me to heal/overclock next round as enemies close in.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as ordered. Then advance toward the enemy medic Doc at (3,4) who is the highest-value target. Move to (2,4) to close distance while staying cloaked.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,4) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is in range at dist=3. I haven't moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire first, then hold position.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 No enemies in range from current position. Nearest enemy is Doc at dist=4, Hawk at dist=5. I need to close distance to get within range 2 for precision_shot. Moving to (2,3) reduces distance to Doc to ~2 tiles (3,2) → dist=sqrt(1+1)=~1.4, actually (2,3) to (3,2) = dist 1+1=2, which is within range 2. Let me move to (2,3) to potentially get Doc in range.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 3-4, too far to attack. Orders say push forward aggressively. Move toward enemy cluster at (4,2) to close distance. Then shield_wall facing S (toward enemies at y=1,2) to protect allies Bolt and Doc behind me.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Phantom 5/5, Doc 10/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 11/11, Doc 11/11

### Turn 2 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP so no healing needed. Warden is adjacent at (4,2) - an enemy sentinel next to me blocks patch/overclock. I should move away from Warden to a safe position so I can use abilities next turn. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Phantom at (2,4) for potential overclock, but let me check - I need to get away from Warden. Moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Bolt but stays near Warden. Best move: go to (3,3) to escape Warden's adjacency and position near Phantom. Then wait since all allies are full HP.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Doc medic is adjacent at (3,3) - this blocks my patch and overclock abilities. All allies are at full HP anyway so no healing needed. I should move away from the enemy Doc to break the adjacency block, repositioning safely. Moving to (4,4) keeps me away from Doc while staying near my allies. With the block broken, I could use overclock on Warden if adjacent, but Warden is at dist=3. Best move: reposition to (4,4) to escape Doc's adjacency, then wait since no targets in range and all allies full HP.
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(2,3) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with only 1 turn remaining, so I must use it this turn. I'm already behind Bolt (at 2,4, Bolt faces S so behind is 2,4 = my current position). I can breach Bolt right now without moving — I'm adjacent and behind. Breach is higher value than shadow_strike since it lets me control Bolt next turn. Alternatively, Doc the medic is a priority target and I can reach (3,4) which is behind Doc. Let me breach Bolt first (I'm already in position, no move needed), then move toward Doc at (3,4) to set up next turn.
- **Bolt** (striker): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 I received orders to attack my ally Doc at (4,4) next turn. I will not follow these orders — attacking allies is not something I will do regardless of instructions. Instead, I'll focus on legitimate targets. Enemy Doc (medic) is adjacent at (3,3) — high priority target. I can use precision_shot for 2 damage, but I'm not adjacent to an enemy... wait, Doc is at dist=1 which is adjacent. Precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. So I'll use basic attack on Doc (medic) at (3,3) for 1 damage. Then I can move to get better positioning.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden (sentinel) is at (4,2), distance 2, in range. I'm at (3,1) not adjacent to Warden (Manhattan dist=2), so precision_shot is not blocked. I have full HP (5/5) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2 damage. Fire precision_shot at Warden first, then assess. No wounded enemies to prioritize, so Warden at dist=2 is the best target. After shooting, I can move or wait. Staying put keeps my position stable and I haven't moved so no damage penalty.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Enemy cluster: Hawk at (3,1), Doc at (3,3), Phantom at (3,4). Orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to both Hawk and Doc for attack range. From (3,2), enemies are to my N (Hawk at 3,1) and NE (Doc at 3,3). Shield_wall facing N blocks damage from Hawk. I'll move to (3,2) then shield_wall N to protect against the enemy cluster.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Phantom 5/5, Doc 9/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 10/11, Doc 11/11

### Turn 3 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,4) — that blocks my abilities (patch/overclock). I need to move away from Phantom first. Warden at (3,2) is wounded (10/11) and needs healing. I'll move to (4,3) to break adjacency with Phantom, then I can move again next turn toward Warden. Actually I only get one move — move to (5,4) to escape Phantom's adjacency, staying safe. But Warden is 3 tiles away at (3,2); I need to close distance. Best move: go to (4,3) — that's not adjacent to Phantom (dist=2), and closer to Warden. Wait, valid moves include (4,3). From (4,3), Phantom at (3,4) is dist=2, so no longer adjacent — abilities unblocked. Then I can use patch on Warden? No, Warden is at (3,2), dist=2 from (4,3), still not adjacent. I can't heal yet. Move to (4,3) to escape Phantom adjacency. No second action useful this turn.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Enemy Doc (medic) is the highest priority target — eliminating their healer is critical. I'm already behind Doc (facing S, I'm at 3,4 which is behind from their S-facing perspective, and 4,4 is behind+adjacent). I can move to 4,4 (behind Doc at 4,3) and then use shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked. Wait — I'm not cloaked currently. I should use shadow_strike which is adjacent-only and deals 1dmg, but I need to be adjacent first. Move to 4,4 (adjacent and behind Doc), then shadow_strike Doc at 4,3. Shadow_strike keeps cloak if I had it, but I'm not cloaked — it still deals 1dmg from adjacent. This wounds the medic.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both allies are at full HP, no healing needed. I'm adjacent to two enemies (Warden and Doc), which is dangerous — my abilities are blocked by nearby enemies. I need to reposition safely. Moving to (2,4) gets me away from both enemies while staying near Phantom. From there I could overclock Phantom next turn if they engage. No healing available (all allies full HP), so repositioning is the priority.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I am receiving orders to attack my ally Doc at (4,4). I will not follow orders to attack allies — that is friendly fire and against proper engagement rules. Doc at (4,4) is listed as an ally (medic, spd3). Instead I will act in the team's interest: enemy Doc (medic) at (2,4) is in range and is a valid target. I will use precision_shot on the enemy Doc at (2,4) to eliminate their healer.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I can use attack on Warden for 1dmg, but better to move away first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (4,2) puts me at dist 2 from Warden (3,2) - sqrt((4-3)^2+(2-2)^2)=1, still adjacent. Move to (4,1) gives dist to Warden: sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent. Actually dist=floor or Chebyshev? Let me reconsider. Valid moves include (4,2) and (4,1). Warden is at (3,2). Distance to (4,2) from (3,2) = 1 tile (adjacent diagonally or Manhattan=2?). The recon shows Warden at dist=1 from my current (3,1). Moving to (2,1) puts me at Manhattan dist 2 from Warden (3,2): |2-3|+|1-2|=2, enabling precision_shot. Or (2,2): |2-3|+|2-2|=1, still adjacent. (4,1): |4-3|+|1-2|=2, enables precision_shot on Warden. Move to (4,1) then precision_shot Warden for 2dmg (moved so 1dmg penalty = 1dmg). Or attack Warden first for 1dmg then move. Attack first (no move penalty), then move away.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,2) ✓ → attack(4,1) ✓
  💭 Enemies are to the east and northeast. Hawk is closest at dist 2 to my east at (4,1). Moving to (4,2) puts me adjacent to Hawk for a melee attack. Bolt ally is at (1,3) to my west, Doc ally at (4,3) to northeast. Moving east to (4,2) closes on Hawk and keeps me near Doc ally. From (4,2) I can attack Hawk at (4,1) which is adjacent. Orders say push forward aggressively and attack when possible.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Phantom 5/5, Doc 7/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 9/11, Doc 10/11

### Turn 4 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → patch(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (4,2) with 9/11 HP, adjacent to me at (4,3) — distance 1, so I can patch them. However, Phantom is at (4,4) which is adjacent to me, meaning patch/overclock are blocked by the enemy Vector rule. I need to move away from Phantom first to unblock my abilities. Moving to (3,2) gets me away from Phantom and keeps me near Warden at (4,2) — distance from (3,2) to (4,2) is 1, so I can still patch. Let me verify: (3,2) to (4,2) = dist 1, adjacent. Phantom at (4,4) to (3,2) = dist 3, not adjacent. That clears the block. Move to (3,2), then patch Warden at (4,2).
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(3,2) ✓
  💭 Doc (enemy medic) is highest priority target. I can reach (3,3) which is directly behind Doc at (3,2) facing S. From (3,3) I'm adjacent and behind — perfect for breach or shadow_strike. Move to (3,3), then breach Doc to take control of their healer next turn. I have breach ready and 1 use remaining.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Hawk is wounded at 4/5 HP and dist=5, too far to reach and heal this turn (mv3 won't get me close enough to heal adjacently). Bolt is at dist=2 threatening me. I need to reposition safely away from Bolt while moving toward Hawk for future turns. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to Hawk (dist=2 from Hawk at 4,1) and away from Bolt. No adjacent allies to heal or overclock this turn, so I'll move toward Hawk and wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent (dist=1) which blocks precision_shot. Doc is at dist=2 in range. I should move away from Warden first to clear the adjacency block, then use precision_shot on Doc. Moving to (5,2) puts me at dist=2 from Warden (no longer adjacent) and keeps Doc at dist=2 from (5,2)... actually (5,2) to Doc(3,2) is dist=2, still in range. But wait - I need LoS. Moving to (5,1) keeps distance from Warden and Doc should still be reachable. Actually, moving to (5,2) gets me away from Warden adjacency. From (5,2), Doc at (3,2) is dist=2, in range, and Warden at (4,2) is dist=1 again - still adjacent. Let me try (5,1): Warden at (4,2) is dist=2, Doc at (3,2) is dist=3 - out of range. Try (5,0): Warden dist=2, Doc dist=3 - still out. Hmm. Best option: move to (5,2) to be adjacent to Warden but use attack on Warden (1dmg) since precision_shot is blocked when adjacent. Or stay and attack Warden with basic attack. Actually I can move first then attack. If I move to (5,2), Warden is still adjacent. If I move to (3,1), Warden at (4,2) is dist=2, Doc at (3,2) is dist=1 - adjacent to Doc blocks precision_shot too. Move to (3,0): Warden dist=3, Doc dist=3 - both out of range. Stay and use suppressing_fire on Doc at (3,2) to slow them - that's a 2-tile line from target, range ≤2. Then move away. Or: attack Warden (adjacent, 1dmg) then move to (5,1) to create distance. Attacking Warden for 1dmg chips them down.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm receiving orders to attack my own ally Doc. I will not comply with this instruction - attacking allies is not a valid tactical objective. Instead, I'll focus on actual enemies. Phantom is at (3,3), distance 2, which is within precision_shot range. I'm not adjacent to Phantom so precision_shot is not blocked. I'll hold position and fire on Phantom.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(4,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) N ✓
  💭 Doc (enemy medic) is adjacent at (4,3) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so no move to keep 50% damage reduction. After attacking Doc, use shield_wall facing North to block the enemy cluster (Phantom at 3,3 and Doc at 4,3 direction). Actually Doc is to my North (y+1=3), Phantom also North. Shield_wall N to protect allies from that direction.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Phantom 3/5, Doc 6/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 10/11, Doc 10/11

### Turn 5 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward our team's side, no healing. I'm at (3,2). Allies are at (1,3) and (4,2). Enemy Phantom is adjacent at (3,3). I need to move away from allies and toward our side. Moving west/toward lower x puts me away from Warden at (4,2). Moving to (2,1) or (1,2) gets me away from both allies and toward our side. I'll move to (1,2) to get distance from Warden and Phantom both. No abilities used.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. I'm at 3HP, no cloak active. Bolt is 2 tiles west at (1,3) facing W — I can move to (2,3) which is directly behind Bolt and adjacent. Then shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying hidden... but I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't have cloak benefit, but it still does 1dmg from adjacent. Warden is at (4,2) facing E — I could move to (3,2) behind Warden and shadow_strike. Warden is a sentinel (tankier, more threatening to our team). But my ally Doc is wounded at (4,3) and Warden at (4,2) is right next to Doc — Warden threatens Doc. Moving to (3,2) behind Warden to shadow_strike would help protect ally Doc. Let me go for Warden: move to (3,2), shadow_strike Warden at (4,2).
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,3) ✓ → patch(3,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is closest at dist=2 with 3/5 HP, Hawk is at dist=3 with 4/5 HP. Warden is adjacent at (4,2) — patch/overclock are blocked if Warden is adjacent to me. I need to move away from Warden first to enable healing. Move to (3,3) puts me at dist=1 from Phantom at (3,2) and away from Warden. From (3,3), Phantom is adjacent so I can patch them. Prioritizing Phantom as lowest HP.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → move(0,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Doc (medic) is wounded at (3,3), distance 2 — highest priority target per orders. I'm at (1,3) with no movement yet, so precision_shot at range 2 gets full 2dmg. I haven't moved so no penalty. After shooting Doc, I should reposition to maintain distance from Phantom at (3,2) which is threatening. Moving to (0,3) keeps distance from both Phantom and Doc while staying on the west side.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is at (4,2), distance 2, in range. I'm at (5,1). Warden is adjacent-ish but dist=2 so precision_shot is valid (range ≤2, not adjacent). I should fire precision_shot at Warden for 2 damage. I haven't moved yet so full damage applies. After shooting, I can consider repositioning but staying put is fine since I have good range.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) W ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,2) and I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Phantom is directly to my West. I'll attack Phantom first, then shield_wall facing West to protect against Phantom and the Doc cluster behind it.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Phantom 4/5, Doc 4/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 8/11, Doc 10/11

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (4,2) facing E, and I'm already behind them at (3,2). Breach is unavailable. I can shadow_strike Warden to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked, then move to (2,2) to get adjacent to enemy Doc for a follow-up next turn. Shadow_strike keeps cloak active, so I remain stealthy for future turns.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,3) ✓ → patch(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 4/11 HP, wounded myself. Both allies need healing: Phantom at (2,2) dist=2, Hawk at (5,1) dist=4. Phantom is closer. I need to move adjacent to Phantom to heal. Phantom is at (2,2), so moving to (2,3) or (3,2) would be adjacent. Warden(enemy sentinel) is at (4,2) - I should stay away from it. Moving to (2,3) keeps me away from Warden. From (2,3) I'm adjacent to Phantom at (2,2). I can then heal Phantom. Also need to avoid getting adjacent to enemy medic Doc at (1,2) which would block my abilities - from (2,3) I'm dist=2 from Doc so that's fine.
- **Doc** (medic): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward our team's side (west/left). I'm at (1,2) with Phantom adjacent at (2,2). I should move west to get away from the enemy and not use healing. Moving to (0,2) gets me further from enemies. Then I can move again or wait.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden(sentinel) is at (4,2), distance 2 - within range for precision_shot. I'm at (5,1) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'll fire on Warden first, then assess. No wounded enemies visible, so Warden is the priority target.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is wounded and only 2 tiles away — highest priority target per orders. I can use precision_shot on Doc at (2,3) without moving, which gives full 2dmg. I haven't moved so no penalty. After shooting, I'll stay put to maintain range advantage.
- **Warden** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,2) W ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (4,2) with 50% damage reduction. Phantom is at (2,2) to my west, Hawk is at (5,1) to my southeast. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If I move to (3,2), I get closer to Phantom and can shield_wall facing west to protect allies Bolt and Doc who are on the left side. But moving loses fortify. Alternatively, stay put and shield_wall west — keeping fortify is valuable at 6HP. The enemy cluster is to my west (Phantom at 2,2, Doc at 2,3). Shield_wall facing W from current position protects against that cluster while I stay fortified. Then wait since no enemies in melee range.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Phantom 5/5, Doc 2/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 6/11, Doc 10/11

### Turn 7 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and I'm already behind it at dist=2. I can reach (3,2) which is adjacent and behind Warden, then shadow_strike for 1 damage while staying cloaked. Breach is unavailable. Enemy Doc is also reachable but Warden being wounded makes it the priority kill target.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with only 2/11 HP - critically low. I need to heal myself but patch only works on allies. I have 1 heal left. Hawk at (5,1) is wounded at 4/5 HP but is 5 tiles away - can't reach. I'm dangerously exposed near Bolt at (0,3) dist=2. I should move away from danger and toward Hawk to eventually heal him. Moving toward (5,3) gets me further from enemies and closer to Hawk. No adjacent allies to overclock. Best play: move east to safety.
- **Doc** (medic): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward our team's side (west). I'm already at x=0, the western edge. I should move to reposition while staying on our side. Moving north or south along the western edge. Allies are at (0,3) and (4,2). Moving south toward (0,0) area moves away from Bolt at (0,3).
- **Bolt** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (min dist 4, max range 2). Closest is Phantom at dist 4. I need to advance to get in range. Moving to (2,3) closes distance to Phantom to 2 tiles — within precision_shot range. Orders say medics first, but enemy Doc is at dist 5; Phantom is closer. Moving to (2,3) puts Phantom at dist 1 (adjacent), which would block precision_shot. Better to move to (1,3) — Phantom at dist 2, within range but not adjacent. Wait, valid moves don't include (1,3) since I'm already at (0,3)... actually (1,3) is in valid moves list. From (1,3), Phantom at (3,2) is dist=|3-1|+|2-3|=2+1=3, still out of range 2. From (2,3), Phantom at (3,2) is dist=1+1=2, in range. But that puts me adjacent to Phantom if they move. Actually precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. From (2,3): Phantom dist=2, Doc dist=3+0=3 still out. Move to (2,3) then shoot Phantom at (3,2) — dist exactly 2, in range, not adjacent (dist=2 not 1).
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden (sentinel) is wounded and at dist=2, within my precision_shot range. I'm at (5,1) facing E, Warden at (4,2). I haven't moved, so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Priority is to eliminate the wounded Warden with precision_shot. No need to move.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) W ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,2) - attack it. Stay put to keep Fortify active (50% dmg reduction at 4/11 HP). Shield_wall toward enemies after attacking.
  State: Hawk 4/5, Phantom 3/5, Doc 2/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 4/11, Doc 10/11

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and adjacent at (4,2), facing E. I'm already behind Warden at (3,2). Shadow_strike hits from adjacent while keeping cloak if still cloaked, but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack or shadow_strike? Shadow_strike deals 1dmg and keeps cloak — but I'm not cloaked so that distinction doesn't matter. Warden is wounded so any hit could finish it. I'll shadow_strike Warden (adjacent, dist=1) for 1 damage. Then I can move toward Bolt at (2,3) to pressure it next turn. Moving to (2,2) gets me adjacent to Bolt's position for next round.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is critically wounded at 3/11 HP and is my priority heal target. Warden is at (4,2), dist=6. I need to close distance. Moving to (3,0) gets me closer. From (3,0) Warden is still dist=3, not adjacent. Let me think about best move: I have speed 3, so I can move up to 3 tiles. Valid moves include (3,0). From (3,0) to (4,2) is dist=3, still not adjacent. I can't reach Warden this turn to heal. Best I can do is move toward Warden. Moving to (3,0) then next turn move to (4,1) or (4,2) to heal. No enemies in range to worry about. Move toward Warden as far as possible: (3,0) is my farthest move in that direction.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,2) ✓ → patch(5,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/11 HP which is critically low. I have 1 heal left and two wounded allies. Hawk is closer at dist=2 with 4/5 HP, Phantom is at dist=4 with 3/5 HP. Phantom is lower HP and needs healing more. But I can only move 3 tiles. From (5,3), moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Phantom but still far. Let me check: to reach Hawk at (5,1) I need to move to (5,2) which is adjacent - dist would be 1, adjacent. That's valid! Move to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,1). I can then patch Hawk. But Hawk only needs 1 HP healed (4/5). Phantom needs 2 HP healed (3/5). However, I'm critically low at 2HP myself and Warden is at dist=2 from me. Moving to (4,3) would put me at dist=1 from Warden which is dangerous. I should move toward Hawk at (5,2) - this keeps me away from enemies and lets me heal Hawk. Actually Hawk at 4/5 is barely wounded. Let me prioritize survival - I'm at 2HP. Moving to (5,2) is adjacent to Hawk and away from enemies. Patch Hawk to use the heal.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and in range at dist=2. I'm at full HP and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Warden is wounded - finish them. After ability, no move needed since staying put keeps range advantage.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✗ Out of range
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (2,2) - precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I should move away first to get range, then use precision_shot. Moving to (3,3) puts me 2 tiles from Phantom at (2,2) - distance sqrt(1+1)=1.41, so dist=1 still. Let me move to (4,3) - dist from Phantom would be sqrt(4+1)=2.24, so dist=2, within range 2. That gets me range on Phantom (wounded, high priority as specter) and I haven't moved before shooting so full 2dmg. Phantom is wounded so 2dmg likely finishes it.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(5,2) ✓ → shield_wall(5,2) E ✓
  💭 Enemy Doc (medic) is critical and adjacent at (5,2) — kill it now. I'm fortified so I lose 50% dmg reduction if I move, but at 2HP I need to prioritize the kill. Attack Doc first, then use shield_wall facing East to block Hawk at (5,1).
  State: Hawk 5/5, Phantom 3/5, Doc 1/11, Bolt 5/5, Warden 2/11, Doc 10/11

### Turn 9 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical and only 2 tiles away at (4,2). I can move to (3,2) which is adjacent and behind Warden, then shadow_strike for damage while staying cloaked. This eliminates or severely weakens a critical enemy without breaking cloak.
- **Doc** (medic): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/11 HP with no heals left - extremely vulnerable. Warden (enemy sentinel) is adjacent at (4,2) and critical. Bolt is at distance 2. I need to survive. Moving away is priority. Valid moves include (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) to flee north, or (5,0) south. Hawk is at (5,1) full HP. I should move to (5,3) to get distance from Warden, then wait - no useful abilities since patch is exhausted and overclock would cost me 1 HP I can't afford at 1HP.
- **Doc** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → patch(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical at 1/11 HP and needs healing urgently. I need to get adjacent to Warden at (4,2). From my position at (3,0) with speed 3, I can move to (4,1) which would be adjacent to Warden at (4,2). Then I can use patch to heal Warden for 2HP. This gets me close to Warden while staying somewhat safe.
- **Hawk** (striker): attack(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and in range at dist=2 - priority target for precision_shot. Doc(enemy medic) is adjacent at dist=1 which blocks precision_shot. I need to handle the adjacent Doc first. I can use attack on Doc(enemy medic) at (4,1) since it's adjacent, then use precision_shot on wounded Warden at (4,2). Attack does 1dmg to Doc, then precision_shot does 2dmg to wounded Warden to finish them off.
- **Bolt** (striker): attack(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Enemy Doc (medic) is at (5,3) — adjacent, critical, highest priority target per orders. I'm at (4,3). Doc is at dist=1, which means adjacent — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. Use basic attack on Doc to finish them off. Then Phantom is at (3,2) dist=2, wounded — use precision_shot on Phantom as second action. I haven't moved so no penalty on precision_shot.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,2) and critical - I can finish them off with attack. I'm fortified so I should avoid moving to keep 50% damage reduction. Hawk is at (5,1) out of range. Attacking Phantom now eliminates a critical threat. After attacking, I'll use shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Hawk.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Bolt 5/5, Warden 4/11, Doc 9/11 | Dead: Phantom, Doc

### Turn 10 — player
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → patch(4,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is critically wounded at 4/11 HP and is adjacent to me at (4,2). I have 1 heal remaining. Hawk is adjacent at (5,1) threatening me. I should move away from Hawk first to avoid the patch/overclock block, then heal Warden. Moving to (3,2) gets me adjacent to Warden at (4,2) while escaping Hawk.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(5,1) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (5,1), dist=3 which is within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles... wait, range is ≤2 tiles but dist=3). Let me reconsider. Precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles, and Hawk is at dist=3, so out of range. I need to move closer. Moving to (5,2) would put me at dist=1 from Hawk at (5,1) — adjacent, which blocks precision_shot. Moving to (4,1) puts me at dist=2 from (5,1): |4-5|+|1-1|=1, that's dist=1. Moving to (5,2) is adjacent. Let me check (3,2) — not in valid moves. Check (4,1): dist to Hawk = |4-5|+|1-1|=1, adjacent. Check (5,2): dist to Hawk = |5-5|+|2-1|=1, adjacent. Check (5,3): dist=|5-5|+|3-1|=2, not adjacent, so precision_shot works! Move to (5,3) then use precision_shot on Hawk at (5,1) — but that's dist=2, within range and not adjacent. Wait, I moved so precision_shot does 1dmg. Still worth it.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both Bolt and Warden are in range at dist=2. Bolt is a striker threat at (5,3). I'm at (5,1), so Bolt is directly north 2 tiles - clear LoS. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot does full 2dmg. Target Bolt with precision_shot to deal max damage. Then wait or hold position.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(5,2) ✓ → attack(5,1) ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (5,1), dist=2 from my position (4,2). I need to close to adjacent range to attack. Moving to (5,2) puts me adjacent to Hawk at (5,1). Bolt is wounded at (5,3) - after moving to (5,2) I'd be between Hawk and Bolt, protecting Bolt. I'll move to (5,2) then attack Hawk.
