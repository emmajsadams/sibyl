The reconnaissance data shows Pulse is 'outRange' for scan from (5,5) — dist 4 but inRange is false, meaning scan requires strictly less than 4 tiles or the boundary condition excludes exactly 4. I need to move closer. Moving to (4,4) puts me at distance sqrt((4-3)^2+(4-3)^2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41 tiles from Pulse — well within scan range. Actually let me recalculate from (4,4) to (3,3): dist = |4-3|+|4-3| = 2 (Manhattan) or Chebyshev = 1. Either way easily within 4. But I already know Pulse's prompt from prior scan. No other enemies visible to scan. I should move to a better position and wait — moving to (4,4) maintains tactical positioning. Since Pulse's prompt is already known and no other enemies need scanning, I'll move closer but not adjacent, and wait.",
