## Squads
### Player
- **Longshot** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Ghost** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Lifeline** (medic): "Keep your frontliner alive with patch. Stay behind them for cover. Overclock your striker or specter when no healing is needed."
### Opponent
- **Shade** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use foresight early to give your team intel. Target enemy specters with mind_spike to break cloak. Stay safe at range behind your front line."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Shade** (specter): cloak(1,4) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, should cloak first. Then move forward toward enemy lines to get in position for future shadow_strikes and breach opportunities.
- **Ghost** (specter): cloak ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1: cloak immediately as ordered. Move forward toward enemies to close distance for future breach/shadow_strike opportunities.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies out of scan range (4). Move to (4,4) to close distance toward Longshot while staying behind Bolt. Next turn can scan.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,2) ✗ Position occupied → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1: All allies at full HP. Move up to support Ghost (frontliner) and position for future heals. Moving to (1,2) gets closer to Ghost while staying behind.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 Bolt is in range at (5,4), 3 tiles away. I can precision_shot for 2dmg without moving first. Prophet is also in range but Bolt is the closer threat and same class.
- **Bolt** (striker): precision_shot(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is in range at (5,0). I can use precision_shot for 2dmg without moving, or move first and deal 1dmg. Since I haven't moved yet this turn, I'll precision_shot for full 2dmg to eliminate the enemy striker threat.
  State: Ghost 5/5, Longshot 2/4, Lifeline 6/6, Shade 5/5, Prophet 8/8, Bolt 2/4

### Turn 2 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(0,0) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,1) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is close and vulnerable. Move to (0,0) behind her, then shadow_strike to deal damage while keeping cloak.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloaked, need to position behind enemies for breach. Prophet at (4,4) facing S - behind tile is (4,5). Move to (3,4) this turn, then next turn move to (4,5) for breach.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bolt is wounded and in range at distance 4. Can finish with precision_shot without moving for full 2dmg.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot is wounded (2/4 HP) but not adjacent. Ghost is full HP. Need to move toward Longshot to heal next turn. Moving to (1,1) advances toward striker while staying behind frontline.
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies out of scan range (4 tiles max). Longshot at (5,0) is 5 tiles away, Lifeline at (1,1) is 6 tiles away. Need to move closer to get either in range. Moving to (5,3) gets me within 3 tiles of Longshot, enabling scan next turn. Staying behind front line as ordered.
  State: Ghost 5/5, Longshot 2/4, Lifeline 4/6, Shade 5/5, Prophet 8/8 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 3 — player
- **Shade** (specter): move(0,1) ✓ → breach(1,1) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked and already behind Lifeline (medic). Moving to (0,1) puts me adjacent and behind her—perfect for breach. I'll breach her to turn the enemy medic against their team, then use my second action to move away if needed or wait.
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → breach(5,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is 3 tiles away. I can reach (5,4) which is directly behind Prophet (facing S). Move there (1 tile, still cloaked), then breach to sabotage this high-value target.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent, blocking my path to Prophet. Must move away from Shade first, then approach Prophet. Moving to (3,1) gets me closer to Prophet while staying out of Shade's immediate range.
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet at range 3 is healthy and vulnerable. Use precision_shot for 2dmg without moving to maintain accuracy. No need to reposition since I have clear LoS and High Ground passive is active (no adjacent enemies).
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(5,1) ✓ → attack(5,0) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move south and attack Longshot. Moving to (5,2) puts me 2 tiles from Longshot at (5,0). Then I can attack - but attack has range:adjacent only, so I'd need to be at (5,1) to hit Longshot. Moving to (5,1) instead, then attacking Longshot.
  State: Ghost 5/5, Longshot 1/4, Lifeline 4/6, Shade 5/5, Prophet 6/8 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 4 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(5,2) ✓ → breach(5,1) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Prophet is at (5,1) facing S. I can reach (5,2) which is behind Prophet and adjacent. Perfect breach opportunity to sabotage their support.
- **Shade** (specter): move(2,1) ✓ → breach(3,1) ✗ Breach on cooldown (1 turns remaining)
  💭 Lifeline is in range for breach setup. Move to (2,1) behind Lifeline, then breach to turn their medic against them.
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(5,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move south and attack Longshot. Longshot is at (5,0), I'm at (5,1). Moving south to (5,0) is invalid (occupied). I can attack Longshot from current position (adjacent, dist=1). Will attack first, then wait.
- **Lifeline** (medic): move(4,1) ✓ → attack(5,1) ✓
  💭 Prophet at (5,1) is priority target but out of range (dist=2). Move to (4,1) to get adjacent, then attack Prophet with healing beam.
  State: Ghost 5/5, Lifeline 4/6, Shade 5/5, Prophet 5/8 | Dead: Longshot, Bolt

### Turn 5 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): breach(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (5,1) and I'm already behind them. Perfect breach opportunity to flip their oracle for 2 turns of control.
- **Shade** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(4,1) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is in breach range at (4,1), facing E. I'm at (2,1) already behind them. Move to (3,1) to get adjacent and behind, then breach to turn them against their team.
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say focus Ghost at (5,2) but Ghost is my ally. Shade and Prophet are enemies adjacent to me. I'm at 4/6 HP but not critically wounded. I should attack an enemy - Prophet at (5,1) is adjacent.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(4,1) ✓ → move(4,0) ✓
  💭 Lifeline at (4,1) attacked me last turn and is adjacent. Ghost at (5,2) attempted breach but it's on cooldown. I need to scan Lifeline to reveal their prompt and help protect Shade per orders. Scan requires ≤4 tiles distance - Lifeline is dist=1, in range. Then move away from both enemies.
  State: Ghost 5/5, Lifeline 4/6, Shade 5/5, Prophet 4/8 | Dead: Longshot, Bolt

### Turn 6 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(3,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,1) ✓
  💭 Move to (3,2) to close distance toward enemies. Then shadow_strike Shade at (3,1) to deal 2dmg while maintaining cloak.
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(4,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Ghost at (3,2) is adjacent and healthy. Lifeline at (4,1) is adjacent and I'm already behind them (facing E). Shadow_strike Lifeline for 2dmg while keeping cloak, then move to (4,2) to get behind Ghost for next turn.
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Ghost is at (3,2) with full HP, no healing needed. Orders say focus fire on Ghost at (5,2) but no enemy there - likely meant Shade. Both enemies adjacent and wounded. Attack Shade to help eliminate threats.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(5,1) ✓
  💭 Shade is wounded at (4,2). Foresight shows Lifeline will attack next turn. I need to scan Ghost to reveal their prompt, then move adjacent to Lifeline to block future scans via Vector's passive.
  State: Ghost 5/5, Lifeline 2/6, Shade 2/5, Prophet 4/8 | Dead: Longshot, Bolt

### Turn 7 — player
- **Shade** (specter): shadow_strike(3,2) ✓ → attack(4,1) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent and facing away (W) - I'm already behind them. Lifeline is wounded and adjacent. Shadow_strike Ghost (keeps cloak if I had it, but I'm uncloaked), then attack Lifeline to finish them.
- **Ghost** (specter): shadow_strike(4,2) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Shade is adjacent and wounded - finish with shadow_strike to maintain cloak, then reposition away from Prophet's oracle beam range
- **Lifeline** (medic): attack(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded and adjacent at (5,1). I can finish them with melee attack. Ghost is wounded but 3 tiles away - I cannot reach to heal this turn. Eliminating the enemy threat takes priority.
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Lifeline is critical and adjacent - finish with attack. Then move away from Ghost's threat range to support Shade healing.
  State: Ghost 3/5, Prophet 3/8 | Dead: Longshot, Lifeline, Shade, Bolt

### Turn 8 — player
- **Ghost** (specter): move(4,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,2) ✓
  💭 Prophet is wounded at (4,2) facing N. I can move to (4,1) which is behind them and adjacent, then use shadow_strike to finish them off while keeping cloak intact.
- **Prophet** (oracle): attack(4,1) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Ghost is adjacent and wounded. I'm at 1HP - critically vulnerable. Must finish Ghost with attack (1dmg to wounded target should kill) then move to safety behind my team.
  State: Ghost 2/5, Prophet 1/8 | Dead: Longshot, Lifeline, Shade, Bolt
