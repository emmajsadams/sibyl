## Squads
### Player
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Pulse** (medic): "Prioritize healing the lowest HP ally. Position safely behind your sentinel. Use overclock on allies who can do the most with an extra action."
### Opponent
- **Seer** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Veil** (specter): "Stay cloaked and flank. Prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Use breach on sentinels to break their defensive posture. Recloak whenever it drops."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(5,4) ✓ → move(5,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — prime time to cloak. All enemies are 5+ tiles away, no adjacent threats. Cloak now to approach invisibly next turns. Move toward center to close distance on Phantom (the enemy damage dealer) while staying cloaked.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(4,0) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Both enemies are far away (dist 4 and 6), no enemies adjacent so cloak is available. After cloaking, advance toward Warden at (4,4) to get into position. Moving to (4,3) closes distance to 1 tile from Warden, setting up a shadow_strike next turn while cloaked.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,2) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 Pulse is at dist=4 which is exactly in scan range, but current position shows inRange=false. I need to move closer to bring Pulse into scan range. Moving to (3,2) would put me at dist=3 from Pulse at (3,1), well within scan range. Aegis is too far. I'll move south to close distance then scan Pulse.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Seer enemy oracle is adjacent at (3,2) - this blocks my patch/overclock abilities. All allies are at full HP so no healing needed anyway. I should move away from the Seer to a safer position behind or near Aegis at (2,0). Moving to (2,2) gets me away from Seer and closer to center. Actually, moving to (2,1) keeps me near Aegis and away from enemies. I can't use abilities this turn due to Seer adjacency, so I'll move to safety and wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) S ✓
  💭 No enemies adjacent. Nearest enemy is Pulse at dist 5 to SW. Move toward enemies to close distance. Valid moves include (3,3) which advances toward (2,1) Pulse. Use shield_wall facing S toward enemies after moving.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,0) facing N, with Pulse at (2,1) and Phantom at (4,3). Enemies are Seer at (3,2) and Warden at (3,3), both out of range. I need to move toward the front line to protect allies. Moving to (2,2) advances me toward the enemies while keeping me between Pulse and the enemy line. From there I can use shield_wall toward N (where enemies are) to protect Pulse behind me, or wait for enemies to close in.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Phantom 5/5, Pulse 9/10, Veil 5/5, Warden 12/12, Seer 6/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Warden is adjacent at (3,3) facing S, so I'm not behind them. The behind tile for Warden is (3,4). If I move to (3,4) I'll be directly behind Warden and can breach them - that's a high-value play since sentinel is dangerous. Seer at (3,2) is also facing S, meaning (3,3) is behind Seer, but that's occupied by Warden. Moving to (3,4) puts me behind Warden for breach. Let me move to (3,4) first, then breach Warden to make them obey me next turn - turning the enemy sentinel against their own team.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,2) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks my scan ability. I need to move away first. Phantom at (3,4) dist=2 is an unscanned specter — high priority target. Moving to (4,2) keeps distance from Aegis (dist=2) and Pulse, and puts Phantom at dist=2 still within scan range. From (4,2), Aegis moves to dist=2 so scan is unblocked. Scan Phantom to reveal their prompt.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,1) ✓ → breach(2,1) ✓
  💭 Pulse is the priority target (damage dealer/medic). I can reach (3,1) which is directly behind Pulse (facing W, so behind = East side). Move to (3,1) then breach Pulse — this puts them under my control next turn. Perfect setup.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(1,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from allies and toward the edge. I'm at (2,1). Allies are at (2,2) and (3,4). Enemy Veil is adjacent at (3,1). I should move away from allies - toward the edge. (0,1) moves me west toward the left edge and away from allies. Then (1,0) or (0,1) gets me to corner. Let me move to (0,1) first, then to (1,0) to reach bottom edge area, away from allies.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → attack(4,2) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward Seer at (3,2) and attack them. Seer is an ally at (4,2). Moving to (3,2) puts me adjacent to (4,2). Then I attack Seer at (4,2).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2). I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) and have full HP. Attack Warden now, then stay in place to maintain fortify next round. No need to move — attacking without moving keeps fortify active... wait, using ability doesn't break fortify, only moving does. I'll attack Warden, then wait to keep fortify.
  State: Aegis 12/12, Phantom 4/5, Pulse 9/10, Veil 5/5, Warden 11/12, Seer 5/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Breach cooldown is 1 turn remaining so I can't breach this turn. Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer — Pulse (medic) is the priority target. I can reach (1,1) which is behind Pulse and adjacent, setting up a breach next turn. Move to (1,1) to get behind Pulse for next turn's breach. No ability this turn since breach is on cooldown and shadow_strike requires adjacency to an enemy I'm not adjacent to.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,2) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (2,2) dist=2, already in scan range and not yet scanned. Pulse at (1,0) is out of range (dist=5). I should scan Aegis to reveal its prompt and deal 1 damage. No need to move first — Aegis is within scan range from current position (4,2). After scanning, I could move to maintain distance or reposition. Moving to (4,3) keeps me away from Aegis and Phantom while staying flexible.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is on cooldown. Seer at (4,3) faces N, so (4,2) is behind them and reachable in 1 step. I can move to (4,2) and shadow_strike Seer — stays cloaked, deals damage to a high-value oracle target. Priority: eliminate the Seer.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(0,0) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward the edge, do not heal. I'm at (1,0). Veil is adjacent at (1,1) - dangerous. Valid moves: [0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[2,1],[3,0]. Moving toward the edge means going to a corner/border. (0,0) is the corner edge and moves me away from allies (Aegis at 2,2, Phantom at 4,2). That's a good edge tile. Then I can wait or move again - but I only get one move action. After moving to (0,0), I'll wait as my second action since orders say don't heal.
- **Warden** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward Seer at (3,2) and attack them. I am already at (3,2), so no move needed. Seer is an ally at (4,3) - I should not attack allies. I will wait rather than attack a friendly unit.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) E ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Warden first, then use shield_wall facing East to block incoming threats from enemies on the right side. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
  State: Aegis 11/12, Phantom 4/5, Pulse 9/10, Veil 5/5, Warden 10/12, Seer 4/6

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,2) facing S. Seer is at (4,3) and I'm already behind them (they face N, I'm to their S). I can breach Seer right now from my current position — I'm adjacent and behind. Breach is ready and Seer is dangerous (oracle). After breaching Seer, I can shadow_strike Warden at (3,2) who is adjacent. This eliminates or controls the two most dangerous adjacent enemies in one turn.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,2) ✓
  💭 Orders: move away from Phantom and attack Warden. Phantom is at (4,2) adjacent to me and plans to shadow_strike me. I need to move away first. Valid moves away from Phantom: (4,4), (4,5), (3,3), (5,3), etc. Warden is my ally at (3,2) - wait, orders say attack Warden? That seems odd but I'll follow orders. After moving, I need to be adjacent to Warden at (3,2). Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Warden at (3,2) and is 2 tiles from Phantom at (4,2) - better distance. From (3,3) I can attack Warden at (3,2) which is adjacent. This gets me away from Phantom and lets me attack Warden as ordered.
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,0) ✓ → breach(0,0) ✓
  💭 Orders say prioritize assassinating the enemy damage dealer. Pulse (medic) is at (0,0) facing W — I'm behind them from (1,0). I can move to (1,0) which puts me behind Pulse and adjacent. Then breach Pulse to take control. Aegis is also reachable from behind at (2,1) but Pulse is the priority damage dealer support. Move to (1,0), then breach Pulse at (0,0).
- **Pulse** (medic): move(0,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team and toward the edge. I'm at (0,0) which is already a corner. Veil is adjacent at (1,0) so I'm blocked from moving east. Valid moves are (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Moving to (0,2) keeps me on the west edge and moves away from Veil. Then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward Seer at (3,2) and attack them. I am currently at (3,2) — I am already at Seer's position. Seer is at (3,3), not (3,2). I should move toward (3,3) to close distance, then attack. Moving to (3,4) or staying — wait, valid moves include (3,4). Seer is at (3,3), which is adjacent to my current position (3,2). I can attack Seer directly without moving. Attack Seer at (3,3) first, then wait. But orders say move toward them too — I'm already adjacent. I'll attack without moving to preserve Fortify bonus (50% dmg reduction if didn't move).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(1,2) E ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Best play: attack Warden first, then use shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Warden/Seer direction. Staying put preserves Fortify.
  State: Aegis 11/12, Phantom 4/5, Pulse 9/10, Veil 5/5, Warden 7/12, Seer 3/6

### Turn 5 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent and wounded — shadow_strike won't break cloak but I'm not cloaked. Seer is wounded and I'm already behind her from (4,3). Best play: move to (4,3) to get adjacent and behind Seer, then shadow_strike for damage while staying safe. Warden is adjacent but I'll prioritize the wounded Seer kill since I can reach her back.
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,2) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Priority is assassinating the enemy damage dealer — but Phantom is at dist 6, unreachable. Pulse (medic) at (0,2) is the support unit keeping enemies alive. I can reach (0,1) which is directly behind Pulse (facing N, so behind = south tile). Move to (0,1), then shadow_strike Pulse — stays cloaked, deals damage to the healer.
- **Seer** (oracle): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Orders: move away from Phantom and attack Warden. Phantom is at (4,3) to my E, so I should move W. Warden is at (3,2), adjacent to S. Attack is only adjacent range. If I move to (2,3), Warden at (3,2) is distance 2 — not adjacent. If I move to (3,4), Warden is distance 2 — not adjacent. I need to stay adjacent to Warden to attack. Warden is at (3,2), so adjacent tiles are (3,3),(2,2),(4,2),(3,1). I'm at (3,3) which is adjacent. Move first to get away from Phantom, but I need to remain adjacent to Warden. Moving to (2,3) puts me away from Phantom (dist 2) and Warden dist=2, can't attack. Moving to (4,2) keeps me near Warden (adjacent) but closer to Phantom. Best: move to (3,4) first — away from Phantom (dist 2), but then Warden at (3,2) is dist 2, can't attack. Foresight says Warden attacks (3,3) then waits — Warden won't move. I'm at (3,3), I'm adjacent to Warden. Orders say move away from Phantom AND attack Warden. I should attack Warden first (while adjacent), then move away from Phantom. Attack Warden at (3,2), then move W to (1,3) — valid move tile, dist from Phantom (4,3) = 3. Actually move to (2,3) is valid and dist from Phantom=2. (1,3) is valid and dist from Phantom=3. Move first order matters for adjacency. If I move first then Warden may no longer be adjacent. Do ability first: attack Warden at (3,2), then move away to (1,3).
- **Pulse** (medic): move(0,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team and toward the edge. I'm at (0,2). Valid moves include (0,0) and (0,4) which are edge tiles. Veil is at (0,1) so moving to (0,0) would bring me closer to an enemy. Moving to (0,4) takes me toward the top edge and away from most of the team. Then I can move further with second action - but (0,4) uses both movement steps already (distance 2). Wait as second action.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) and wounded — attack to finish or weaken. I'm fortified so staying put is optimal for damage reduction. Attack Warden first, then shield_wall East to block any incoming threat from that direction.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) W ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (2,2). I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Aegis first, then use shield_wall facing West where Aegis is, to protect allies from that direction.
  State: Aegis 10/12, Phantom 4/5, Pulse 8/10, Veil 5/5, Warden 5/12, Seer 2/6

### Turn 6 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders: move away from Phantom and attack Warden. Phantom is at (4,3), I'm at (1,3). Moving west/away. Warden is at (3,2) but attack range is adjacent only — I can't reach Warden from current position or most moves. Valid moves show (3,3) which puts me adjacent to Warden at (3,2) and Aegis at (2,2), but that's moving toward Phantom. Best interpretation: move away from Phantom to maximize distance, then attack is not possible (Warden not adjacent). Move to (0,3) — wait, not in valid tiles. Move to (0,2) or (0,5) to get away from Phantom at (4,3). (0,5) maximizes distance from Phantom. From (0,5) no enemies adjacent so attack impossible. Orders say attack Warden — Warden is at (3,2), I need to be adjacent. But moving toward Warden means moving toward Phantom. Compromise: move to (1,2) to get somewhat closer to Warden while slightly away from Phantom, but still not adjacent. Actually valid tiles include (3,3) which is adjacent to Warden at (3,2). Orders are explicit: move away from Phantom AND attack Warden. These conflict since Warden is toward Phantom. I'll prioritize the attack order — move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Warden, then attack Warden at (3,2). This moves away from Phantom slightly (Phantom at 4,3, I go to 3,3 — distance 1, actually closer). Re-reading: move away first. I'll move to (1,4) away from Phantom, cannot attack Warden. Follow orders as given — move to (1,4) away from Phantom, wait since Warden not adjacent.
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,4) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Pulse (medic) is at (0,4) facing N — I can reach (0,3) which is directly behind them and adjacent. Shadow_strike from there deals damage while keeping cloak. Move to (0,3) then shadow_strike Pulse to eliminate the enemy healer.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,2) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded and I can reach (3,3) which is directly behind them (facing S, so behind = N side). Move to (3,3) then shadow_strike Warden at (3,2) — shadow_strike works adjacent and keeps cloak. Priority target: wounded Warden.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(0,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders are to move away from team and toward the edge. I'm at (0,4). Valid moves: [0,2],[0,5],[1,3],[1,5],[2,4]. Moving to (0,5) takes me to the north edge and away from enemies at (0,3) and (1,4). Then wait.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) and wounded — attack to finish them off. Stay put to keep Fortify active for damage reduction. No move needed.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) W ✓
  💭 At 3HP with fortify active, I need to be careful. Two enemies adjacent: Aegis at (2,2) and Phantom at (3,3). Orders say attack adjacent enemy and use shield_wall. If I attack Phantom (specter, likely lower HP/defense than sentinel), that's good. But if I move I lose fortify. Stay put, attack Phantom who is adjacent at (3,3), then use shield_wall facing the direction with most enemies. Aegis is W, Phantom is N — two enemies, N has Phantom. Actually Aegis is at (2,2) which is SW direction, and Phantom is at (3,3) which is directly N. Shield_wall facing N covers Phantom's approach direction. But I should attack first then shield_wall. Attack Phantom at (3,3).
  State: Aegis 10/12, Phantom 3/5, Pulse 7/10, Veil 5/5, Warden 3/12, Seer 2/6

### Turn 7 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(0,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(0,5) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Priority target is Pulse (medic, healthy, dist=2). I can move to (0,4) which is directly behind Pulse (facing N, so south is behind). From (0,4) I'm adjacent to Pulse at (0,5) — I can shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. This eliminates their healer threat.
- **Phantom** (specter): attack(3,2) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical and adjacent at (3,2), facing S — I'm already behind them at (3,3). Shadow_strike deals 1 damage and keeps cloak if I'm cloaked, but I'm not cloaked. Regular attack deals 1 damage. Warden is critical so even 1 damage should finish them. Then I can move toward Seer who is wounded. I'm at 3HP so I need to be careful. Attack Warden first to eliminate them, then move to (1,3) to get behind Seer for next turn.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) with only 2HP — critically low. Phantom is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded — dangerous. Foresight shows Phantom moved to (3,3) last turn and struck Warden at (3,2). All three enemies already scanned, so no scan value there. Warden is critical at (3,2) and being attacked by both Phantom and Aegis. I should recalibrate Warden to help them survive, but Warden is at (3,2) — not adjacent to me. I can move to (2,3) to get adjacent to Warden, then recalibrate. But Phantom is at (1,3) — moving through or near there is risky. Move to (3,3) puts me 1 tile from Warden at (3,2) — that's adjacent. From (1,4) I can reach (3,3) with mv3 (distance = 2+1=3 — exactly in range). Then recalibrate Warden at (3,2). This gets me away from Phantom and helps our critical sentinel. Wait — Phantom was at (1,3) this turn. If I move to (3,3) that's away from Phantom. Recalibrate Warden to hold on and shield_wall effectively.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (0,4) - this blocks patch/overclock. I need to move away from Veil first. Valid moves: (0,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). Moving to (1,5) keeps distance from Veil while repositioning. Phantom at (1,3) has 3/5 HP and is dist=3 - I can't reach them this turn. After moving to (1,5), Veil is no longer adjacent (dist=2), so abilities are unblocked. But Phantom is still at dist=2 from (1,5) - not adjacent. I can't heal anyone this turn. Best move: get to (2,5) to close distance toward Phantom, but Veil would be at dist=3. Still can't reach Phantom. No ability targets in range after any move. Best play: move to (1,5) or (2,5) to position for next turn, then wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,2) ✓ → shield_wall(3,2) W ✓
  💭 I'm at critical HP (2/12) but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Aegis is adjacent to my west at (2,2). Orders say to attack adjacent enemies and use shield_wall facing E to block Aegis. Wait — Aegis is to my WEST (I'm at 3,2, Aegis at 2,2), so shield_wall should face W to block damage from Aegis. But orders specifically say face E. I'll follow orders and attack Aegis first since they're adjacent, then shield_wall facing E as ordered. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent and critical - attack to finish them off. I'm fortified so I should stay in place to keep 50% damage reduction. Seer is at distance 2, not adjacent yet. Attacking Warden is the priority.
  State: Aegis 9/12, Phantom 3/5, Pulse 6/10, Veil 5/5, Warden 1/12, Seer 2/6

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Seer is wounded and I can reach (2,3) which is directly behind them (they face E, so W side is behind). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage. Move to (2,3) then shadow_strike Seer at (3,3). This eliminates a wounded oracle efficiently.
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. Priority target is Phantom (wounded, enemy specter at 2,3 facing E). I can reach (1,3) which is behind Phantom and adjacent — perfect for shadow_strike which keeps cloak. Move to (1,3), then shadow_strike Phantom. This deals damage without breaking cloak, keeping me hidden for next round.
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(3,2) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely critical. Phantom is adjacent at (2,3) and will attack me next round. I must escape immediately. Move to (4,4) to get distance from Phantom and Aegis. From (4,4), Pulse at (2,5) is within scan range (dist ~2.8 ≤ 4) — but Pulse is already scanned. All enemies already scanned. Warden is critical at (3,2) — I should recalibrate to buff them. From (4,4), Warden at (3,2) is dist ~2.8, not adjacent. Best option: move to (4,3) — Warden at (3,2) is dist ~1.4, not adjacent either. I need to be adjacent to recalibrate. Warden is at (3,2), adjacent tiles are (2,2),(4,2),(3,1),(3,3). I'm at (3,3) which IS adjacent to (3,2)! So I can recalibrate Warden now before moving. But Phantom at (2,3) is adjacent — scan is blocked for vectors, not recalibrate. Recalibrate Warden first (adjacent at 3,2), then move away to safety at (4,4).
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is critically low at 2/5 HP and is 2 tiles away. I need to close the gap to heal them. Moving to (2,3) would put me adjacent to Phantom at (2,3) - wait, Phantom is AT (2,3), so moving to (2,4) puts me distance 1 from Phantom. From (2,4) I can patch Phantom. Veil is at (1,3) dist=3 from current, dist=2 from (2,4) - not adjacent, so patch won't be blocked. Let me move to (2,4) then patch Phantom at (2,3).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) W ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,2) and critical — attack to finish. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Veil is 2 tiles away at (1,3), threatening Phantom. Use shield_wall W to protect Phantom from Veil's direction.
  State: Aegis 9/12, Phantom 5/5, Pulse 6/10, Veil 5/5, Seer 1/6 | Dead: Warden

### Turn 9 — player
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(2,3) ✓ → move(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,3) facing S, and Phantom is at (2,3) facing E — I'm already behind Phantom (their west side). Breach is exhausted (2/2 used). I can use shadow_strike which deals 1 damage while keeping cloak. Phantom is healthy so this chips them down. I'm cloaked, adjacent, and behind — shadow_strike is the ideal play. After that, I can move to (2,5) to get behind Pulse for a future strike, or stay positioned. Actually, let me shadow_strike Phantom now, then move to (2,5) to get behind the wounded Pulse — setting up a kill next turn.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → scan(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically wounded. I have prompts on all enemies already. Veil is healthy, so no recalibrate needed there. I need to survive. Foresight shows Phantom moved to (2,3) and shadow_struck (3,3), so Phantom could threaten me. I should move away to safety while using my ability. I can scan Pulse (wounded, dist 2) to deal damage. Moving to (5,5) or (5,4) keeps me at range. Actually, I should move to maximize distance from enemies. Move to (5,5) first, then scan Pulse at (2,4) - distance from (5,5) would be 4 tiles (|5-2|+|5-4|=4), within range. This deals 1 damage to wounded Pulse. Stay alive, deal damage.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,5) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted (2/2). No enemies in range from current position. Veil is at dist=2 to the north, facing N — I'm behind them but can't reach adjacent for shadow_strike this turn without moving first. Move to (2,4) to get adjacent to Veil from behind, then shadow_strike — shadow_strike keeps cloak and I'm already cloaked. Pulse is at (2,4) though — wait, Pulse is at (2,4)? Let me check: Pulse @(2,4)→S wounded. I can't end on an ally. So (2,4) is occupied. I need another adjacent tile to Veil at (2,5): that would be (1,5), (3,5), or (2,4). (2,4) is occupied by Pulse. Can I reach (1,5) or (3,5)? Both are in valid moves list. From (1,5) or (3,5) I'd be adjacent to Veil at (2,5). Move to (3,5) then shadow_strike Veil.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,4) ✓ → patch(3,5) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (2,5) - I'm blocked from using patch/overclock due to adjacent enemy Vector. I need to reposition away from Veil to enable healing. Moving to (3,3) would put me at dist=2 from Veil (safe) and dist=2 from Aegis at (2,2). But I only have mv2. From (2,4), I can reach (3,3) in one move (dist=2, diagonal). Wait - valid moves include (3,3). From (3,3) I'd be adjacent to Aegis at (2,2)? No, dist from (3,3) to (2,2) = 2, not adjacent. Let me think differently. I need to get adjacent to a wounded ally. Phantom is at (3,5) HP:4/5, dist=2 from me. If I move to (3,4) - wait, (3,4) is in valid moves. From (3,4), Phantom at (3,5) would be adjacent (dist=1). And Veil at (2,5) would be dist=2, so not adjacent - patch would be unblocked! Move to (3,4), then patch Phantom at (3,5). But Phantom only needs 1HP... actually Aegis is more wounded (9/12, missing 3HP) vs Phantom (4/5, missing 1HP). Orders say prioritize lowest HP ally - Phantom at 4HP is lower. Move to (3,4) to get adjacent to Phantom, then patch Phantom.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,2) fortified with 50% damage reduction. Pulse is wounded at (3,4) and Veil is approaching from (2,5) at dist=3. I should move north toward (2,4) to get between Veil and my allies, protecting Pulse. Then use shield_wall facing North to block incoming damage from Veil.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,5) ✓
  💭 Seer is critical HP and I can reach (5,4) which is behind them — perfect shadow_strike opportunity. Move to (5,4) first, then shadow_strike Seer to finish them without breaking cloak. Veil is adjacent but I'll disengage toward Seer.
- **Veil** (specter): shadow_strike(2,4) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. I'm at (2,5) adjacent to Aegis at (2,4). Pulse is wounded at (3,4) — priority target. I can move to (4,4) which is behind Phantom, but Pulse is the wounded damage dealer. I'm currently behind Pulse (Pulse faces E, I'm at (2,5) which is to its west/behind). No reachable behind-Pulse positions listed, but I can shadow_strike Aegis for 1 damage while staying cloaked, then move toward Pulse. Actually, best play: shadow_strike Aegis (adjacent, keeps cloak, 1 dmg), then move to (4,4) to get behind Phantom for next turn. Wait — orders say prioritize the enemy damage dealer. Pulse is wounded and closer. I should shadow_strike Aegis now (free damage, keeps cloak), then move to (3,3) or (3,5) to set up on Pulse next turn. (3,3) puts me 1 tile south of Pulse for a shadow_strike next turn. Let me shadow_strike Aegis first (adjacent, keeps cloak), then move to (3,3) to flank Pulse.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(2,5) ✓ → patch(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with Veil adjacent at (3,3) — patch/overclock are blocked by adjacent enemy. I need to move away from Veil first to enable healing, then patch Aegis who is wounded at (2,4). Moving to (2,5) puts me adjacent to Aegis at (2,4) and away from Veil. From (2,5) I can patch Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is at (3,3), distance 2 — not adjacent so I can't attack. Pulse (medic) is at (2,5) wounded and needs protection. I'm currently fortified at (2,4). Moving to (3,4) closes on Veil and keeps me between enemies and allies, but loses fortify. Better to move to (3,3) would be dist 0 but Veil is there. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Veil at (3,3) — distance 1 diagonally, but attack requires adjacent only (N/S/E/W). Veil is SE of me. Moving to (3,4) puts Veil at (3,3) which is directly south — adjacent! I can then attack. This also keeps me between Veil and Pulse. Let's move to (3,4) then attack Veil at (3,3).

### Turn 11 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is at (3,3) facing S, wounded, dist=3. Breach is unavailable. No enemies in range for shadow_strike. I need to close in. Moving to (4,3) puts me at dist=1 from Veil — adjacent — allowing shadow_strike next turn. Valid moves include (4,3). Let me move there to set up a shadow_strike on Veil.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP, cloaked. Breach is unavailable. Priority is assassinating Phantom (enemy damage dealer/specter). Phantom is at (4,3) facing S - I can move to (4,4) to get behind them, then use shadow_strike to deal 1dmg while staying cloaked. Shadow_strike keeps cloak so I remain hidden. Aegis is adjacent at (3,4) but I should focus on Phantom as ordered.
- **Pulse** (medic): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch is unavailable (0 uses left). Aegis is wounded at (3,4) dist=2, not adjacent. Phantom is wounded at (4,3) dist=4, not adjacent. Veil enemy at (4,4) dist=3. I should move toward Aegis to potentially overclock them next turn, positioning safely. Moving to (3,5) gets me closer to Aegis at dist=1, adjacent next turn for overclock. That's the best play.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (4,4) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Veil to finish them off, then hold position to maintain fortify bonus next turn.
