## Squads
### Player
- **Doc** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Advance toward the nearest enemy. Use shield_wall facing the direction with the most enemies. If an enemy is adjacent, attack them."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
### Opponent
- **Marksman** (striker): "Stay at maximum range. Use precision_shot on the most wounded enemy to secure kills. If no one is wounded, target the enemy medic. Never move adjacent to enemies."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(1,1) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move north to close distance on Lens (closest enemy at dist 4). Max movement toward (1,4) gets me closer while staying cloaked.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is in scan range at dist=3. I'll scan to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. Doc is out of range at dist=5. No need to move — current position is safe and optimal for scanning Rampart.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at dist=5, out of my range-2 precision_shot. Orders say target the medic (Doc) when no one is wounded. I need to close to range 2. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer - dist to Doc@(3,0) becomes 3, still out of range. Moving to (3,3) gets dist to Doc = |3-3|+|3-0|=3, still out. Best I can do is move 2 tiles toward enemies. From (4,4), moving to (4,2): dist to Doc@(3,0) = 1+2=3, still out of range-2. Moving to (3,3): dist to Doc = 0+3=3. Moving to (3,4) then... wait, let me check (4,2): dist to Rampart@(2,1) = 2+1=3, out. No enemies in range after any move either. I'll advance toward Doc (the medic priority target) while staying safe. Move to (3,3) to advance, then wait.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,1) ✓ → patch(2,1) ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded at (2,1) with 11/12 HP, dist=2 from me at (3,0). I need to get adjacent to heal. Moving to (3,1) puts me at dist=1 from Rampart at (2,1) — adjacent. Then I can patch Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) N ✓
  💭 Nearest enemies are Lens at (2,4) dist=3 and Marksman at (3,3) dist=3. Orders say advance toward nearest enemy and use shield_wall facing direction with most enemies. Moving to (2,3) closes distance to both Lens and Marksman. Enemies are generally to the North, so shield_wall facing N makes sense to protect myself and Doc at (3,1).
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,3) N ✓
  💭 Pushing forward aggressively per orders. Move to (3,4) to close distance with Rampart at (2,3). Then shield_wall facing North toward the enemy cluster to protect allies Lens and Marksman who are nearby.
  State: Phantom 5/5, Rampart 12/12, Doc 9/9, Bastion 12/12, Lens 6/6, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(3,1) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) - scan is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector. Wait, Rampart is a sentinel not a Vector, so scan should work. But Rampart is already scanned. Doc at (3,1) is dist=4, exactly at scan range and not yet scanned - priority target. However, Rampart is adjacent which means I'm in danger. I should move away from Rampart first to avoid melee, then scan Doc. Moving to (1,4) keeps distance from Rampart while staying in range of Doc at (3,1) - dist from (1,4) to (3,1) = 2+3=5, too far. Moving to (1,5) - dist to Doc (3,1) = 2+4=6, too far. Moving to (4,4) - dist to Doc (3,1) = 1+3=4, in range. That works and moves away from Rampart. Actually Rampart is a sentinel not a Vector, checking: scan blocked by adjacent enemy Vector. Rampart is sentinel, not Vector class. So scan isn't blocked. But Rampart is adjacent and could attack. I should move away and scan Doc. Move to (4,4) first, then scan Doc at (3,1) from dist=4.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Bastion is at (3,4) facing S, and the tile behind them is (3,5) which is reachable. Moving to (3,5) puts me behind Bastion and adjacent for breach or shadow_strike next turn. I can reach (3,5) in one move (dist=1 from there, and it's in my valid moves list). Let me move to (3,5) to get behind Bastion — perfect position for breach next turn since breach must be from behind. Shadow_strike doesn't break cloak so I could also shadow_strike from there.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Marksman is closest enemy at dist=2. I should move closer to Rampart (sentinel ally at 2,3) to stay adjacent to a frontline ally, then use overclock on Rampart to boost our damage dealer/tank. Moving to (2,2) puts me adjacent to Rampart at (2,3) and closer to the action.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. No enemies are wounded, so I should target the medic Doc per orders. I need to move away from Rampart first to enable precision_shot, and stay at max range. Moving to (4,3) keeps distance from Rampart and maintains range 2 to Doc at (2,2). After moving, I can fire precision_shot at Doc (dist=2 from new position, but moved so only 1dmg). Better: move to (5,3) to maximize distance from Rampart, then Doc is at dist=3 which is out of range 2. Let me check: from (4,3), Doc at (2,2) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, tile dist=|4-2|+|3-2|=3. From (4,2), Doc at (2,2) is dist=|4-2|+|2-2|=2, in range. And Rampart at (2,3) is dist=2, not adjacent. So move to (4,2): not adjacent to Rampart, Doc at dist=2 in range. Precision_shot after moving = 1dmg (moved penalty). That's still damage on the medic per orders.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,3) with fortify active. Nearest enemy is Bastion at (3,4), dist 2. I should advance toward Bastion to get adjacent for an attack. Moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (3,4). Then I can attack Bastion. Enemies are mostly to the E/NE, so shield_wall facing E would protect allies. But with OVERCLOCKED I have 2 ability uses — I'll move to (3,3) first, then attack Bastion who will be adjacent to my N, then use shield_wall facing E for the second ability use.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) S ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent to the south at (3,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I can attack Rampart directly, then use shield_wall facing south to protect allies from the enemy cluster direction. Staying in place preserves fortify bonus.
  State: Phantom 5/5, Rampart 10/12, Doc 7/9, Bastion 10/12, Lens 6/6, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(3,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned — prompts known. Phantom is at (3,5) and will shadow_strike (3,4) where Bastion is. I should recalibrate Bastion to warn about incoming strike. Rampart will attack (3,4) too — Bastion is in danger. Recalibrate Bastion at (3,4) with addendum about the incoming threats. I'm at (4,4), Bastion is at (3,4) which is adjacent — recalibrate is range:adjacent. After recalibrate, I can move to safety or wait.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Bastion (facing S, I'm at 3,5 which is behind them). Cloak has 1 turn remaining — I should use shadow_strike now to deal damage while staying cloaked. Then move to (4,4) to get behind Lens for a breach or shadow_strike next turn. Lens is the most dangerous (oracle) so positioning behind them is high priority.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 No enemies are wounded, so orders say to target the enemy medic (Doc). Doc is at (2,2), distance 2 from my position (4,2). I have LoS and am not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is valid. I'll stay put and fire precision_shot at Doc for 2 damage.
- **Doc** (medic): move(3,2) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart (sentinel) is wounded at (3,3) with 10/12 HP, distance 2. I need to move adjacent to heal. Valid moves include (3,2) which would put me adjacent to Rampart at (3,3). Move to (3,2) then patch Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4). Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'm fortified so I want to stay put and keep 50% damage reduction. I'll attack Bastion first, then use shield_wall. Enemies are mostly to the North/East of me — Bastion is directly North at (3,4), Marksman at (4,2) is SE, Lens at (5,4) is NE. Most enemies are to my North, so shield_wall facing N protects against Bastion. I'll stay in place (no move) to keep Fortify active.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) E ✓
  💭 Phantom at (4,4) and Rampart at (3,3) are both adjacent. Warning says both will attack me. I'm fortified (50% DR) and facing S. If I stay and use shield_wall facing E toward Phantom, I can block incoming hits from that direction while attacking Rampart. But orders say attack when possible. Best play: attack Rampart (dist=1), then shield_wall facing E to block Phantom's shadow_strike. This keeps me fortified (no move), maximizes damage output, and reduces incoming damage.
  State: Phantom 5/5, Rampart 11/12, Doc 4/9, Bastion 8/12, Lens 6/6, Marksman 5/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(5,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Lens (oracle) at (5,4) since I'm at (4,4) and Lens faces E. I can use breach on Lens right now — I'm adjacent and behind. Lens is the highest-priority target (oracle = high threat). Save shadow_strike for after breach forces Lens to act for me. Actually, breach makes them obey me next turn which is powerful. Use breach on Lens now, then shadow_strike Bastion since I'm also adjacent to it.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,2) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally lines and away from combat. Phantom is adjacent at (4,4) and dangerous — I need to disengage. Scan is blocked when adjacent to enemy Vector, but Phantom is a specter not a Vector, so scan should work. However, orders say move away. I should move to (5,5) to get distance from Phantom, then scan Doc at (3,2) dist=4 to deal 1dmg and reveal — but wait, after moving to (5,5), Doc would be at dist=4 still (|5-3|+|5-2|=2+3=5, out of range). Better to scan first from (5,4) while Doc is exactly at dist=4, then move to (5,5) to retreat from Phantom.
- **Doc** (medic): move(2,2) ✓ → patch(3,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 I'm at (3,2) with 3/9 HP, facing Marksman adjacent at (4,2). Rampart is wounded at (3,3) — adjacent to me, needs heal. I have 1 patch use left. Priority: patch Rampart first. But patch is blocked if adjacent to enemy — Marksman is at (4,2), distance 1, so I'm adjacent to an enemy. I need to move away from Marksman first, then patch Rampart. Moving to (2,2) gets me away from Marksman and keeps me adjacent to Rampart at (3,3) — dist=1 from (2,2) to (3,3) is 1, so still adjacent. Then I can patch Rampart.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Doc (medic) is wounded and at distance 2 — perfect precision_shot target. Eliminating the medic prevents healing and secures a kill. I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Stay at current position to maintain range 2.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,4) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Marksman is at (4,2) dist=2, Lens at (5,5) dist=4. Most enemies are to my north/east. After attacking Bastion, use shield_wall facing N to cover Phantom at (4,4) from Bastion's direction.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,4) E ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 50% damage reduction active. Both Phantom and Rampart are adjacent and will attack me this round. Moving would lose my Fortify passive, which is valuable given incoming hits. Better to stay fortified, absorb the damage, and attack Rampart (the sentinel tanking for their team). Shield_wall facing East covers Phantom's direction and protects any nearby allies.
  State: Phantom 5/5, Rampart 10/12, Bastion 6/12, Lens 6/6, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Doc

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 Orders are to move toward ally lines and away from combat. I'm at (5,5), allies are at (3,4) and (4,2). Phantom is at (4,4) and used shadow_strike on Bastion last turn. Moving to (4,5) keeps me near allies while retreating from Phantom. Then scan Phantom to deal 1 damage and reveal their prompt - they're in range at dist=2.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Bastion is wounded and adjacent — shadow_strike it to finish it off while staying cloaked. Then move to (5,5) to get behind Lens for a potential breach next turn when cooldown expires.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is in range at distance 2 and is healthy. Phantom is out of range at distance 4. Orders say to target the enemy medic if no one is wounded — sentinel is not a medic, but Rampart is the only target in range. I'm currently at (4,2), not adjacent to Rampart at (3,3) — distance is 2 so precision_shot is valid. I should fire precision_shot on Rampart without moving to maintain maximum range.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,3) S ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,4) with 50% damage reduction. Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) to my south. Phantom will shadow_strike me and Rampart will attack — I should stay put to keep Fortify active and use shield_wall facing south to reduce incoming damage, then attack Rampart who is in range.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so I should stay put to keep 50% damage reduction. After attacking, use shield_wall facing North to block Bastion and any threat from that direction.
  State: Phantom 4/5, Rampart 7/12, Bastion 4/12, Lens 6/6, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Doc

### Turn 6 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(4,5) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Lens is adjacent at (4,5) and I'm already behind them (facing W, I'm at (5,5) which is east/behind). Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals damage — perfect target. After striking Lens, I can move to (3,5) which puts me behind Bastion (wounded) for a potential breach next turn.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move toward ally lines and away from combat. Phantom is adjacent at (3,5) which is dangerous — scan is blocked when adjacent to an enemy Vector, and I'm at risk. Foresight shows Phantom will shadow_strike Bastion at (3,4) and then move to (5,5). I should move away from Phantom. Best move is (5,4) to retreat east and away from the dangerous specter, staying near Marksman at (4,2). No ability needed — scan blocked by adjacent Phantom anyway.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded and in range at dist=2. I'm not adjacent to Rampart (dist=2), so precision_shot is valid. Fire precision_shot on Rampart to secure the kill. No need to move.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,5) N ✓ → attack(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, flanked by Phantom (N at 3,5) and Rampart (S at 3,3). Both will attack me this round. I should keep fortify active by not moving, and use shield_wall to mitigate incoming damage. Phantom is the bigger threat as a specter with shadow_strike. I'll shield_wall facing North to block Phantom's incoming attack, then attack Rampart who is wounded and easier to finish off.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) N ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack adjacent enemies. I'll attack Bastion first, then use shield_wall facing North (toward Bastion/enemy cluster) to protect against further damage while staying fortified.
  State: Phantom 4/5, Rampart 4/12, Bastion 3/12, Lens 5/6, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Doc

### Turn 7 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Bastion is critical and adjacent to Phantom at (3,5) — Phantom is about to shadow_strike (4,5) then move to (3,5). Rampart attacked Bastion last turn. Bastion needs recalibrate to help it survive. I'm at (5,4), Bastion is at (3,4) — that's 2 tiles away, not adjacent. I need to move closer to recalibrate Bastion. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Bastion at (3,4). Then recalibrate Bastion to buff them against the incoming threat.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(3,4) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Bastion (critical) at distance 1, and breach is ready. Bastion is critical so I could finish it with shadow_strike, but breach is more valuable on a dangerous enemy. Lens (oracle) is the most dangerous - healthy and already acted this round. I can breach Bastion to make it obey me, but that wastes breach on a critical unit. Better to shadow_strike Bastion first to finish it (it's critical, so likely 1HP left), then move toward Lens for next round. Shadow_strike keeps my cloak if I have it active. Actually I'm not cloaked currently. I'll use shadow_strike on Bastion (adjacent, behind) to finish it, then move to (5,4) to get behind Lens for next turn's breach.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded and in range at distance 2. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2 damage. Target Rampart to secure the kill. Stay at current position to maintain range and avoid adjacency.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) E ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent at (3,4) and critical — attack to eliminate. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Lens and Marksman are both to the east/northeast, so shield_wall facing N (toward Bastion) or E makes sense, but attacking Bastion takes priority. After attacking Bastion, use shield_wall facing E to cover against Lens and Marksman.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely critical. Rampart is adjacent at (3,3) and will attack me. Phantom will shadow_strike my position then move to (3,5). I need to eliminate Rampart first (it's critical health) to remove one threat, then reposition away from (3,5). Attack Rampart at (3,3) first, then move south to (3,5)... wait, Phantom moves to (3,5) so I shouldn't go there. Move to (2,4) instead to escape Phantom's projected position and get away from Rampart's range too.
  State: Phantom 4/5, Rampart 1/12, Bastion 1/12, Lens 5/6, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Doc

### Turn 8 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Lens (oracle) at (5,4) facing W. Lens is adjacent at (4,4) and I'm behind them. Breach is ready and Lens is healthy — breaching them would make them obey me next turn, neutralizing a dangerous oracle. Then I can shadow_strike for damage. Breach first, then shadow_strike to stay safe.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward grid edge, then wait. I'm at (4,4). Allies are at (2,4) and (4,2). Moving toward grid edge means going north or east. Phantom is at (5,4) adjacent to me — moving east would put me next to the edge but also toward Phantom. Moving north to (4,5) gets me to the top edge and away from allies at (2,4) and (4,2). (4,5) is in my valid moves list. Then wait.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at critical HP and only 2 tiles away - priority target for a kill. I'm at (4,2), Rampart is at (3,3), distance 2 which is within precision_shot range. I haven't moved yet so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Rampart is critical so 2dmg should finish them. Stay put to preserve full precision_shot damage.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,5) N ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP with fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Phantom will shadow_strike my position and move to (3,5). I need to avoid (3,5) and survive. Moving south to (2,3) gets me away from (3,5) danger zone while keeping fortify... but moving will lose fortify. At 1HP, I'll die to almost any hit regardless. Best play: stay fortified (don't move) to maximize damage reduction from incoming hits, and use shield_wall facing North to protect against Phantom coming from that direction. Actually Phantom is at (5,4) moving to (3,5) - that's north of me. Shield_wall N could block damage to adjacent allies. But I have 1HP and will likely die - I should try to be useful. Wait and use shield_wall facing N toward where Phantom will be.
  State: Phantom 4/5, Bastion 1/12, Lens 4/6, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Rampart, Doc

### Turn 9 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,5) ✓
  💭 Breach is exhausted. I'm at (5,4) facing E, 4HP. Lens is at (4,5) and I'm already behind it — (4,4) is the tile behind Lens and it's adjacent+reachable in 1 move. Move to (4,4) then shadow_strike Lens at (4,5) for 1 damage while staying cloaked if I have it, or just attack. Shadow_strike is the best choice — 1dmg, keeps cloak, range adjacent. Lens is healthy and dangerous, priority target.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward grid edge, then wait. I'm at (4,5) facing N. Phantom is adjacent at (4,4) — dangerous, especially since Foresight shows it used breach+shadow_strike last turn, meaning it may strike again. I need to move away. Valid moves include (5,5) which is a corner/edge and away from Phantom. Moving to (5,5) puts distance and gets me to the edge.
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is at (4,4), distance 2 from my position (4,2). I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is available. Phantom is healthy but it's the only enemy in range. Orders say to use precision_shot on most wounded enemy, or if none wounded, target enemy medic. No medic visible, so I'll fire precision_shot at Phantom. I haven't moved, so full 2dmg applies. Stay put to maintain range.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): wait ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/12 HP and fortified — moving will break fortify and I'll be extremely vulnerable. Phantom is at dist=2 and will shadow_strike me. With 1 HP, any hit kills me. I should stay fortified (50% damage reduction) and not move, preserving the damage reduction. No enemies in melee range so I can't attack. I'll wait to keep fortify active and hope the 50% reduction lets me survive the incoming hits.
  State: Phantom 1/5, Bastion 1/12, Lens 3/6, Marksman 5/5 | Dead: Rampart, Doc
