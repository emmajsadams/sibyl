## Squads
### Player
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Lattice** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
### Opponent
- **Lattice** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."
- **Bastion** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Hawk** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 5-7). Need to advance to get precision_shot range (≤2 tiles). Move north toward center to close distance while maintaining sight lines. Best advance tile is (2,2) which gets me closer without overextending.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are at distance 5, out of my range 2. I need to advance to get into firing position. Moving to (4,3) brings me 2 tiles closer while keeping me away from the center. Enemies are at dist 5 so no shots available this turn - advance and wait.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): move(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Enemies are at (3,1) and (2,2) — roughly south of me (I'm facing S at 3,4). I should advance toward them. Moving to (3,2) closes distance maximally. From there I can shield_wall facing S to protect allies behind me from the enemy cluster. Hawk ally is at (4,3) — adjacent after my move to (3,2), so shield_wall S would block damage coming from the enemy direction.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion enemy is adjacent at (3,2). I can attack it directly. If I stay put (don't move), Fortify gives me 50% damage reduction. Best play: attack the adjacent enemy Bastion, then wait to keep Fortify active.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, all enemies are distant. Hawk at (2,2) is closest at dist=3, likely moving north toward me. I should advance and place a trap on a tile in Hawk's likely path. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer and lets me trap (2,2) or nearby tiles that enemies must cross. From (2,3) I can trap tiles at range ≤2. The enemy Hawk at (2,2) will likely move north, so trapping (2,3) directly or (2,2) makes sense. I'll move to (2,3) first, then trap (2,2) which is the tile the enemy Hawk currently occupies - wait, can't trap occupied tiles. I'll trap (1,2) or (2,1) as likely approach routes. Enemy Hawk moving north from (2,2) might go to (2,3) or (2,4) - but I'll be at (2,3). Let me trap (1,2) as a flanking intercept, or trap (3,2) near the ally Bastion to catch enemies approaching that cluster. Actually, trapping (2,2) after enemy Hawk leaves it is ideal - trap the tile they just vacated as they advance. I'll move to (2,3) and trap (2,2) anticipating Hawk will move off it.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,1) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies advancing from north. Enemy Hawk is at (4,3) directly above me, enemy Bastion at (3,2). I should move forward and place a trap on a tile enemies are likely to pass through. Enemy Hawk at (4,3) moving south will likely pass through (4,2) or (4,1). I'll move to (4,1) to get closer and place a trap at (4,2) - a tile the enemy Hawk would naturally advance through.
  State: Bastion 12/12, Hawk 5/5, Lattice 7/7, Bastion 11/12, Lattice 7/7, Hawk 5/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → suppressing_fire(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Lattice at (2,3) which is blocking my precision_shot. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone to use precision_shot effectively. Moving to (1,2) gets me away from Lattice and out of denial zone, giving me range 2 to Bastion at (3,2) for a clean precision_shot. Bastion is at dist=1 currently but after moving to (1,2) it becomes dist=2, still in range. I won't have moved this turn if I move first then shoot — wait, moving first means I moved, so precision_shot does 1dmg. Better to shoot first but I'm in denial zone. So: move first to escape denial, then use basic attack or suppressing_fire. From (1,2), Bastion at (3,2) is dist=2, in range for precision_shot but I moved so it does 1dmg. Alternatively suppressing_fire on Bastion to slow it. Actually suppressing_fire does 1dmg in a 2-tile line — targeting Bastion at (3,2) from (1,2) would fire east hitting (3,2) and (4,2) which has a trap. That's risky. Move to (1,2), then suppressing_fire at Bastion: 1dmg and slows it.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(4,1) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Enemy Lattice(vector) is at (4,1), dist=2, in range for precision_shot. I'm at (4,3) and haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Lattice is healthy but 2dmg is significant. I should fire precision_shot at Lattice first before any move to keep full damage. Then I can reposition — moving to (5,3) or (5,4) to maintain distance from enemy Bastion at (3,1) and keep sight lines. Avoid moving adjacent to ally Lattice at (2,3). Enemy Lattice(vector) is the priority target as it denies my abilities if adjacent.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) S ✓
  💭 Bastion is adjacent to the south at (3,1). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction and suppressed (move 1). Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Enemy cluster is to the south (Bastion at 3,1, Lattice at 4,1). I'll attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing S to protect against the southern cluster. Staying put preserves Fortify bonus.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(5,1) ✓ → trap(5,2) ✓
  💭 There's already a trap at (4,2). Enemy Bastion is at (3,2) and could move toward us. Enemy Hawk is at (5,3) and might push toward (5,2) or (5,1). I can't place a trap at my current position or adjacent to enemies. Moving to (5,1) puts me in a good flanking position and lets me place a trap at (5,2) to catch Hawk moving down. Alternatively, move to (4,3) to place trap on a key corridor. Let me move to (5,1) then place trap at (5,2) to intercept Hawk.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,1) with Bastion adjacent to the north at (3,2). I can attack Bastion for 1 damage. If I don't move, I keep Fortify active (50% damage reduction). I should stay put and attack the adjacent enemy Bastion, then use shield_wall to protect allies if needed. Lattice ally is wounded at (5,1) — enemy Hawk is at (5,3) threatening them. I'll attack Bastion and hold position to maintain Fortify.
- **Lattice** (vector): trap(2,2) ✓ → attack(1,2) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Enemy Hawk (striker) is at (1,2), distance 2 - in attack range. Enemy Bastion is at (3,1) and likely to advance north toward our position. I should place a trap on a tile the enemy Hawk or Bastion might move through. Tile (2,2) is between me and both threats - good trap placement. Then attack Hawk with pulse isn't worth it (only 1 enemy adjacent). I'll trap (2,2) to deny movement, then attack Hawk directly since they're in range.
  State: Bastion 11/12, Hawk 5/5, Lattice 4/7, Bastion 9/12, Lattice 7/7, Hawk 5/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) with 5HP. Enemies: Bastion(sentinel) at (3,2) dist=2, Lattice(vector) at (2,3) dist=2. Both in range for precision_shot. Lattice(vector) is the bigger threat - it blocks my abilities if adjacent. I'm not adjacent to enemy Lattice now (dist=2), so precision_shot is available. Lattice at (2,3) is dist=2, healthy. Bastion at (3,2) is dist=2, healthy. Neither is wounded so no priority kill target. I should NOT move adjacent to enemy Lattice. Best play: use precision_shot on enemy Lattice at (2,3) to start whittling them down (they're the denial threat). If I stay put, no movement penalty on precision_shot so full 2dmg. Then wait or position.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(5,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice(vector) is wounded and at (5,1) — exactly 2 tiles away, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved so precision_shot deals full 2dmg, which should finish off the wounded vector. I'm not adjacent to enemy Lattice(vector) so precision_shot is not blocked. Shoot first, then decide on repositioning if needed.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with Bastion adjacent to my south at (3,1). Orders say push forward aggressively and attack when possible. Bastion is in melee range — attack first. If I attack without moving, I keep fortify for defense. Then use shield_wall facing South to block Bastion's attacks on allies. But wait — orders say push forward. However, moving would lose fortify and I'm at 9/12 HP. Bastion is right there at dist=1, so I should attack. If I move south to (3,0) I'd be adjacent to Bastion and lose fortify. Better to stay and attack Bastion, then shield_wall facing south toward the enemy cluster.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion enemy is adjacent at (3,2) — attack it. I'm fortified so staying in place preserves 50% damage reduction. No need to move.
- **Lattice** (vector): attack(1,2) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Hawk(striker) is adjacent at dist=2 and in range. There's already a trap at (2,2). Enemy Hawk is at (1,2) moving toward us likely. I can't place a trap adjacent to an enemy Vector (Lattice is far away at dist=5, so no denial issue). I should attack Hawk with my ranged attack (rng2), then move to avoid being cornered. Enemy Bastion is at (3,1) dist=3 — not immediate threat. Priority: attack Hawk, then reposition to place trap on likely enemy path or maintain distance.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(4,0) ✓ → trap(5,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,1) with only 1HP - critically low. Enemy Hawk is at (5,3), distance 2, directly north. Traps already at (4,2) and (5,2) blocking some paths. I need to survive. Valid moves include (4,0), (4,1), (5,0) - moving away from Hawk. I can't use trap since enemy Hawk is within range 2 and... wait, denial only blocks when adjacent. Hawk is at dist 2, not adjacent. But I'm at 1HP so I should retreat. Move to (4,0) to get away from Hawk who is north at (5,3). Then place a trap on (5,0) or (4,1) to deny pursuit paths. Actually Hawk could move to (5,1) where I am or (4,2) which is already trapped. Let me move to (4,0) to escape, then trap (5,0) to block pursuit.
  State: Bastion 10/12, Hawk 5/5, Lattice 1/7, Bastion 8/12, Lattice 4/7, Hawk 5/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(2,1) ✓ → precision_shot(1,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm adjacent to enemy Lattice (vector) at (1,3) which blocks my precision_shot. I need to move away from Lattice's denial zone first, then use precision_shot on the wounded Lattice. Moving to (0,2) puts me at dist=1 from Lattice but I need to check if that breaks adjacency... actually I need to move further. Moving to (2,1) gets me away from Lattice at (1,3) - dist would be sqrt(1+4)~2.2, not adjacent. From (2,1) I can target Lattice at (1,3) with precision_shot (dist=2, within range). This kills the wounded Lattice.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 4-5, my range is 2). I need to close distance on Lattice (critical HP, dist=4) to get a kill. Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to Lattice at (4,0) - that would put me dist=2, in range for precision_shot next turn. Avoid (2,2) trap. Moving to (4,2) is safe and positions me for a kill shot on critical Lattice next round.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,2) ✓ → trap(1,1) ✓
  💭 Enemies: Hawk at (2,1) is closest at dist 3, moving north likely toward me. Enemy Bastion at (3,1) also threatening. There's already a trap at (2,2). I should place a trap on a tile enemies will move through. Hawk at (2,1) moving north would step through (2,2) - already trapped! They might go (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1) area. I can move to (1,2) to get closer and place a trap at (1,1) which is a likely path for Hawk moving north, or place at (2,2) - already has trap. Let me move to (2,3) to be within trap range of (2,2) area and place trap at (1,2) or stay and place trap at (2,2) - but it's already trapped. I'll move to (1,2) and place trap at (2,1) - but that's where Hawk is currently (can't trap occupied tile). Place trap at (1,1) as Hawk might move there. Current position (1,3), move to (1,2) gets me closer. From (1,2) I can trap at (1,1) or (2,2) - (2,2) already has trap. Place trap at (1,1) to cover Hawk's likely northward path.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,1) N ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,1) with 50% damage reduction. Bastion enemy is adjacent at (3,2). I should attack Bastion to deal damage while maintaining my fortified position. After attacking, I'll use shield_wall facing North to protect allies from Bastion's threat. Staying in place preserves Fortify passive.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(3,1) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with Bastion enemy adjacent at (3,1). I should attack Bastion since it's in range. Moving would break my Fortify passive, so I'll stay put and attack, then use shield_wall facing south to protect allies if needed. Actually, enemy Bastion is to my south (3,1) and enemy Hawk is at (2,1). Orders say push forward and shield_wall toward enemy cluster. If I attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing S toward the enemy cluster, that maximizes damage and protection. But wait — Bastion is at (3,1) which is SOUTH of me at (3,2). Attack it, then shield_wall S to protect against further threats.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(3,0) ✓ → trap(4,1) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - critically low. Enemy Hawk is at (4,2), dist 2, directly north - in range for attack. I need to survive. Moving away from Hawk is priority. Trap at (5,2) already covers east flank. I can place a trap at (3,0) to block approach from enemy Bastion at (3,2) who might push south. Then move to (5,1) to get distance from Hawk while staying near (5,2) trap zone. Actually, at 1HP I should move first to (5,1) to escape Hawk's adjacency threat, then place trap at (5,0) - wait, (5,0) already has a trap. Move to (3,0) to get behind friendly lines near ally Bastion at (3,1), then trap (4,1) to block Hawk's advance south.
  State: Bastion 9/12, Hawk 5/5, Lattice 1/7, Bastion 7/12, Lattice 4/7, Hawk 4/5

### Turn 5 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(1,2) ✓ → suppressing_fire(3,2) ✓
  💭 Both Bastion(sentinel) and Lattice(vector) are wounded and in range at dist=2. I'm not adjacent to enemy Lattice(vector) at (1,2) — I'm at (2,1), that's diagonal distance sqrt(2), not adjacent. So precision_shot should not be blocked. Priority: kill a wounded enemy. Lattice(vector) at (1,2) is wounded and closer threat. But wait — my ally Lattice(vector) is at (3,0) critical, and enemy Lattice is at (1,2). I should finish off a wounded enemy. Enemy Lattice(vector) at (1,2) is dist=2 from me at (2,1) — that's valid range for precision_shot. I haven't moved so full 2dmg. That should finish a wounded enemy. Then I can use suppressing_fire or stay put. Actually let me target enemy Bastion(sentinel) at (3,2) wounded — also dist=2. Either works. I'll target enemy Lattice(vector) at (1,2) since it poses denial risk. No movement needed — stay at (2,1) for full precision_shot damage.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Lattice (vector) is critical and at dist 3 — out of range. Hawk is at dist 3 — out of range for precision_shot (range ≤2). Bastion (sentinel) is at (3,1), dist 2, healthy — within precision_shot range. I'm at (4,2), not adjacent to enemy vector Lattice (dist 3, safe). No move needed to engage Bastion. Fire precision_shot at Bastion for 2dmg since I haven't moved. Then wait or hold position.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(0,3) ✓ → trap(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) with 1HP - critically low. Enemy Hawk is at (2,1) distance 2, in range for trap. There's already a trap at (1,1) and (2,2). I need to survive. Moving away from danger while placing a trap on likely enemy movement paths. Hawk at (2,1) is healthy and close - likely to move toward me or my allies. If I move to (0,3) I get distance from Hawk. I can place a trap at (1,1) - wait, that's already trapped. I can trap (0,2) or enemy approach paths. Actually I should trap (2,2) - already trapped too. Let me trap (1,3) or (0,1) to cover retreat paths, or better - trap (2,1) where Hawk currently stands... but traps go on empty tiles. Hawk is on (2,1) so can't trap there. Best play: move to (0,3) to flee danger, then trap (1,2) my current position as a defensive measure - enemies may move through it chasing me.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → shield_wall(4,1) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, adjacent to wounded enemy Bastion at (3,2). Lattice ally is critical at (3,0) behind me. Enemy Hawk is at (4,2) threatening our flank. Best play: attack the wounded Bastion to finish it, then use shield_wall facing North to protect Lattice from the enemy Bastion if it survives, or face East to cover against enemy Hawk. Since Bastion is wounded, attacking it is priority. After attacking, I should shield_wall facing East to block Hawk's approach toward our allies.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(4,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,2) with 50% damage reduction, suppressed so movement is limited to 1 tile. Bastion enemy is adjacent at (3,1) — wounded, prime target for attack. Moving to (2,2) would hit a trap, (3,3) moves me away from the enemy cluster. Best to stay fortified and attack Bastion while using shield_wall facing S to protect against Hawk at (2,1). Actually, orders say push forward and shield_wall facing enemy cluster — enemies are to my south. I'll attack wounded Bastion first, then shield_wall facing S to cover against Hawk and Lattice below.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,0) ✓ → trap(4,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/7 HP — critically low, one hit from death. Enemy Hawk is healthy at (4,2), enemy Bastion is wounded at (3,2). My valid moves include (4,1) but there's a trap there. I need to avoid getting killed. Moving west to (1,0) gets me away from the enemy cluster. I can place a trap at (4,0) or (5,0) to threaten enemy movement paths. The enemy Hawk at (4,2) might move south toward (4,1) or (4,0) — placing a trap at (4,0) could catch them. I should move away first to survive, then trap a likely enemy path.
  State: Bastion 6/12, Hawk 5/5, Lattice 1/7, Bastion 5/12, Lattice 1/7, Hawk 4/5

### Turn 6 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion at (3,1) is wounded and in range at dist=2. I'm at (4,2) and haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. No adjacent enemies blocking precision_shot. Firing on wounded Bastion for likely kill. No need to move first.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bastion (sentinel, wounded) is at distance 2 — precision_shot can finish it. I'm at (2,1), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg applies. Bastion is wounded so 2dmg should kill or critically wound. After shooting, I'll wait to preserve position.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(1,1) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/7 HP — critically wounded and need to avoid death. No enemies in range. Traps are already at (4,0), (4,1), (5,0), (5,2). Enemy Hawk is healthy at (4,2) and likely to move toward our allies. I should place a trap in the path between enemies and our cluster. Moving to (3,0) puts me closer to allies and lets me place a trap at (4,0) area — but (4,0) is already trapped. I can move to (1,1) to stay safer and place a trap at (2,2) to intercept the enemy Bastion's approach path. At 1 HP I must prioritize survival — stay away from enemies and contribute via trap placement.
- **Lattice** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 I'm at critical HP (1/7) so survival is priority. Enemies are approaching from the south - Hawk at (2,1) and Bastion at (3,1). There are already traps at (2,2) and (1,2). I should move closer to allies while placing a trap on a likely enemy path. Moving to (2,3) brings me closer to ally Hawk at (4,2) and Bastion at (3,2), and I can place a trap at (2,2)... wait, (2,2) already has a trap. Let me place at (1,2)... also has a trap. Move to (2,3) and place trap at a new location. From (2,3) I can place at tiles within 2 range. Enemy Hawk at (2,1) might move north toward (2,2) trap - good. I could place at (3,2) or (2,3) area to cover enemy advance. Move to (2,3), then place trap at (3,2) to intercept enemy Bastion moving north.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,1) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) S ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,2) facing S with 3/12 HP, fortified. Enemy Bastion is adjacent at (3,1) wounded — I can attack for 1 damage, and with fortify active I take reduced damage. I should attack the wounded Bastion to try to finish it off. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I'll attack Bastion first, then shield_wall facing S to protect against the enemy Hawk at (2,1) and block incoming damage. Staying in place preserves fortify.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): attack(3,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/12 HP (critical) but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Enemy Bastion is adjacent at (3,2) and critical too. I should attack it to potentially finish it off, then stay put to keep fortify active. Moving would lose fortify, which is crucial at low HP. Attack the adjacent Bastion, then wait to maintain fortify.
  State: Bastion 3/12, Hawk 5/5, Bastion 2/12, Lattice 1/7, Hawk 4/5 | Dead: Lattice

### Turn 7 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Enemy Bastion at (3,1) is critical and distance 2 - perfect for precision_shot (2dmg, range≤2). I haven't moved yet so no damage penalty. I'm not adjacent to enemy Vector so precision_shot isn't blocked. Fire on critical Bastion to finish it, then wait or reposition. No need to move first.
- **Hawk** (striker): precision_shot(3,2) ✓ → suppressing_fire(2,3) ✓
  💭 Two critical enemies in range from current position: Bastion(sentinel) at (3,2) dist=2 and Lattice(vector) at (2,3) dist=2. I have not moved this turn, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Lattice is a vector — if I move adjacent I lose abilities, so must stay cautious. From (2,1) I can fire precision_shot at Bastion at (3,2) for 2dmg — that should finish a critical target. Lattice at (2,3) is also critical and dist=2, but it's a vector so I want to be careful. After killing Bastion, I can use suppressing_fire on Lattice to slow it. However, precision_shot requires LoS and I haven't moved — Bastion is highest priority kill. Trap at (2,2) blocks that move tile. I'll stay put, precision_shot Bastion to finish it, then suppressing_fire Lattice to slow its advance.
- **Bastion** (sentinel): shield_wall(3,1) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1/12 HP — critically low. Fortified gives 50% damage reduction while stationary, which is my best survival tool. Enemy Hawk is at (4,2), dist=2, not yet adjacent. Ally Hawk is at (2,1). I should stay put to keep Fortify active, and use shield_wall toward the enemy (East direction) to protect myself and the front line. No adjacent enemies to attack.
  State: Bastion 1/12, Hawk 5/5, Hawk 4/5 | Dead: Lattice, Bastion, Lattice

### Turn 8 — player
- **Hawk** (striker): move(3,2) ✓ → suppressing_fire(4,2) E ✓
  💭 Hawk is at (4,2), dist=3, which is outside my precision_shot range of ≤2. I need to close distance. Moving to (3,2) puts me at dist=2 from Hawk (|4-3|+|2-2|=1... wait, (3,2) to (4,2) is dist=1). Actually from (3,2) Hawk is adjacent... no, (3,2) to (4,2) is 1 tile apart. Let me recalculate: dist from (2,1) to (4,2) = |4-2|+|2-1|=3. Moving to (3,2) gives dist=|4-3|+|2-2|=1, but that's adjacent which blocks precision_shot. Moving to (2,2) is a trap. Moving to (3,0): dist to Hawk=(|4-3|+|2-0|)=3, still out of range. Best approach: move to (3,2) is adjacent-ish. Actually (3,2) to (4,2) is dist=1 (adjacent), precision_shot blocked. Try (2,3): dist to Hawk = |4-2|+|2-3|=3, still out. The only tile within range 2 of Hawk that isn't adjacent: dist must be exactly 2. From (4,2), tiles at dist=2: (2,2)trap, (3,0),(4,0)trap,(4,4),(5,2)trap,(6,2)OOB,(3,4),(2,2)trap. Valid non-trap dist=2 tiles I can reach: (3,0) is reachable (in valid moves). From (3,0) to Hawk(4,2): |4-3|+|2-0|=3. That's dist=3. Hmm. Let me reconsider range: precision_shot range≤2 tiles. Tile (3,1) not in valid moves. Wait, valid moves include [3,2] and [3,0]. From (3,2): dist to (4,2)=1 (adjacent, blocks precision_shot). From (2,2): trap. No good firing position reachable this turn. I'll move to (3,2) and use suppressing_fire on Hawk to slow them, keeping pressure while Bastion is critical.
- **Hawk** (striker): move(4,1) ✓ → precision_shot(3,1) ✓
  💭 Bastion is critical at dist=2, precision_shot deals 2dmg which would finish them. I'm suppressed so movement is limited to 1 tile. Hawk is adjacent at dist=1, which blocks precision_shot. I need to move away from Hawk first to clear the precision_shot restriction, then shoot Bastion. Moving to (4,1) puts me dist=2 from Hawk (no longer adjacent), and Bastion is still at dist=2 from (4,1) - still in range. Then fire precision_shot at Bastion to finish them.
  State: Hawk 5/5, Hawk 2/5 | Dead: Bastion, Lattice, Bastion, Lattice
