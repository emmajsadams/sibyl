## Squads
### Player
- **Watcher** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Longshot** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Aegis** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan early to give your team intel on enemy prompts. Target enemy specters with scan to track them after cloak. Use recalibrate on allies who need tactical adjustments. Stay safe at range behind your front line."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(3,1) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is exactly at dist=4 from my current position (3,0) — within scan range. Moving north to (3,1) keeps Lens at dist=3, still in range, and gets me closer for future turns while staying behind allies. I'll move first then scan Lens to reveal their strategy and deal 1 damage.
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are far (5-7 tiles). Veil is the closest enemy at (0,0) facing N, directly below me. I should cloak then move toward center to advance on enemy lines while invisible. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer to the action while staying mobile.
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(3,1) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher (enemy oracle) is within scan range at dist=3. Scanning them early reveals their prompt and deals 1 damage - high priority. Longshot is just out of range at dist=4. After scanning Watcher, I can move to reposition or wait. Staying at current position keeps me safe behind front line. I'll scan Watcher first, then move slightly to stay in range of enemies while remaining safe.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(0,0) ✓ → move(1,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and advance toward enemies. Both targets are at distance 7, out of range. Cloak now to stay invisible while closing in. Move toward center to approach Lens at (3,4) which has a behind tile at (3,5).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(2,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are at distance 4, out of my range-2 precision_shot. I need to advance to get into range. Moving to (2,3) closes distance to Lens at (3,4) to dist=2, putting them in range. I'll move first, then fire precision_shot at Lens (oracle - high value target).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(1,4) S ✓
  💭 Longshot is at (2,3), dist 2 — close threat. Orders say push forward aggressively. I can move to (2,4) to close on Longshot, then use shield_wall facing S (toward enemy side) to protect Phantom at (1,3). Moving to (2,4) puts me adjacent to Longshot's position next turn and screens my allies.
  State: Watcher 5/6, Longshot 4/4, Veil 4/4, Aegis 8/8, Phantom 4/4, Lens 4/6

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): scan(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Longshot targeted me with precision_shot last turn and is at (2,3) dist=2 — I should scan them to reveal their prompt and deal 1 damage. Watcher already scanned. Veil is cloaked and unknown position. I'm at 4/6 HP after taking a hit. Stay at range, scan Longshot first. No need to move — current position is safe with Aegis and Phantom nearby as frontline.
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,2) ✓ → recalibrate(2,3) ✓
  💭 Lens already scanned — prompt known. Foresight shows Phantom cloaked and moved to (1,3), adjacent to Veil. Aegis at (2,4) dist=4, just out of scan range. Longshot is my damage dealer at (2,3). I should recalibrate Longshot to boost effectiveness against enemies. Then scan Lens again isn't needed. Move north to (3,2) to get Aegis in scan range (dist=3), then recalibrate Longshot at (2,3) — dist from (3,2) to (2,3) is adjacent? No, dist=√2≈1.4, that's diagonal=not adjacent for recalibrate (adjacent means dist=1 orthogonally). From (3,2): Longshot at (2,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. From (3,2) Aegis at (2,4) dist=√(1+4)>2. Better: stay at (3,1), recalibrate is range adjacent only. Longshot at (2,3) — from (3,1) dist=√(1+4)>1, not adjacent. Veil at (1,2) from (3,1) dist=√(4+1)>1, not adjacent. No allies are adjacent. I can scan Lens at (3,4) dist=3 from current position — that's useful intel even if already scanned (1 dmg). Or move to get adjacent to an ally for recalibrate. Move to (2,2) — Longshot at (2,3) is then adjacent (dist=1), then recalibrate Longshot with tactical addendum.
- **Veil** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Neither enemy is reachable for breach/shadow_strike from current position. Aegis is at (2,4) facing S — behind tile is (2,5) which is unreachable this turn. Best move: advance toward Aegis to get adjacent next turn. Move to (1,4) to close distance while staying cloaked. No ability available this turn.
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(1,4) ✓ → move(2,1) ✓
  💭 I'm already behind Veil (enemy specter) at my current position (1,3) — the recon confirms I'm behind them and adjacent. I can use shadow_strike on Veil to deal damage while maintaining cloak. This is ideal since shadow_strike doesn't break cloak. After the strike, I could move toward (2,1) to get behind Watcher for a potential breach next turn. Cloak has 1 turn remaining so I need to act smart. Shadow_strike Veil first, then move toward Watcher's behind tile.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(3,3) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Lens is the priority target (oracle/scanner). I'm at (2,3), Aegis is adjacent at (2,4) which blocks precision_shot (adjacent enemy). I need to move first to get range on Lens without being adjacent to an enemy. Moving to (3,3) gives me distance 2 from Lens at (3,4) and puts me away from Aegis. From (3,3) I'm not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot works. Lens at (3,4) is 1 tile away from (3,3) — that's range ≤2. I haven't moved yet when shooting... wait, I'm moving first then shooting, so precision_shot deals 1dmg (moved). Still worth it to neutralize Lens.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(1,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (1,4) — attack immediately. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Lens (ally) is at (3,4) wounded; I can shield_wall facing West to block Veil's potential follow-up, but attacking Veil first is higher priority. After attacking Veil, shield_wall facing W to protect against Veil or threats from that direction.
  State: Watcher 5/6, Longshot 3/4, Veil 2/4, Aegis 8/8, Phantom 4/4, Lens 3/6

### Turn 3 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (2,1) — scan is blocked by adjacent enemies only for Vector class, and Phantom is a specter not vector, so scan should work. Priority: scan Phantom to reveal their strategy (they just used shadow_strike on Veil who is wounded). Then recalibrate Longshot to boost damage output. I should move away from Phantom to maintain safe range — move to (2,3) puts me between allies and keeps scan range on enemies. Actually, scan Phantom first at dist=1, then move to (2,3) to get distance.
- **Veil** (specter): move(2,5) ✓ → breach(2,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at 2/4 HP and not cloaked. Aegis is adjacent at (2,4) facing S — I can move to (2,5) to get behind them, then breach. Breach from behind is high value: they'll obey me next turn, wasting Aegis and potentially turning them against their team. I can reach (2,5) which is behind Aegis and adjacent. Move to (2,5) first, then breach Aegis.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm at 3HP so survival is critical. Longshot is adjacent at (3,3) and will precision_shot me next turn — I need to move away. Veil is wounded at (2,5) and in scan range — scanning them would reveal their prompt and deal 1dmg, potentially finishing them off or making them easier to track after cloak. I should move first to get away from Longshot, then scan Veil. Moving to (4,4) keeps me at range from Longshot and maintains scan range on Veil at dist=3. Veil at (2,5) from (4,4) = dist 3, still within range 4.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,2) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher is 2 tiles away at (2,3) facing N, meaning (2,2) is directly behind them and reachable. I can move to (2,2) and use shadow_strike on Watcher — shadow_strike works adjacent and keeps cloak. This is ideal: I'm already cloaked (turn 1), I can stay cloaked and deal damage. Move to (2,2), then shadow_strike Watcher at (2,3).
- **Longshot** (striker): precision_shot(4,4) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Lens is wounded and high-value (oracle/scanner). I'm at (3,3), Lens is at (4,4) — distance 2, in range for precision_shot. I haven't moved yet so no damage penalty. Orders say focus fire on Lens. After shooting, I can move to (4,3) or (3,4) to maintain range from Aegis and Phantom while staying in position. Moving to (5,3) puts me further from Phantom threat at (2,2) and away from Aegis at (2,4), maintaining distance as ordered.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): attack(2,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say to attack my nearest ally next turn — but this turn I should position and act tactically. Veil is critical and adjacent (2,5), Watcher is healthy and adjacent (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. I'll attack Veil to finish them off while staying put to keep Fortify active. Next turn I'll attack an ally as ordered.
  State: Watcher 4/6, Longshot 3/4, Aegis 8/8, Phantom 3/4, Lens 2/6 | Dead: Veil

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): breach(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (2,3) and I'm already behind them (facing N, I'm at (2,2) which is their south). I can breach Watcher to take control, or shadow_strike for safe damage. Breach is ready and would be powerful — Watcher is an oracle, potentially dangerous. Using breach now turns them against enemies next turn. I'm at 3/4 HP so I should be aggressive. Breach Watcher from current position — I'm already in the behind tile at (2,2).
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,5) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP — critically low. Longshot already used precision_shot on me last turn and will likely do so again. Both enemies are already scanned. I should move away from Longshot's range and stay alive. Moving to (3,5) gets me further from Longshot at (5,3) and Watcher at (2,3). Then I can recalibrate Phantom at (2,2) — but Phantom is at (2,2) and I'd be at (3,5), not adjacent. Better: move to (3,4) to be closer to Aegis at (2,4) for safety, then recalibrate Aegis since they're adjacent to the enemy cluster. Actually, Aegis is at (2,4) — from (3,4) that's adjacent. Recalibrate Aegis to focus on Watcher who is nearby. Primary goal: survive by getting distance from Longshot.
- **Watcher** (oracle): attack(2,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Orders say attack nearest enemy. Aegis is adjacent at (2,4), dist=1. I can attack Aegis directly. Phantom is also adjacent at (2,2) but Aegis is the primary target per orders. After attacking Aegis, I should move away from Phantom who shadow_struck me last turn (Foresight shows Phantom moved to (2,2) and shadow_struck (2,3) — that's my position). Moving to (1,3) puts distance between me and Phantom while staying in play.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,5) ✓
  💭 All enemies are at distance 4, out of my range 2. I need to close to range 2 to use precision_shot. Lens is wounded and highest priority. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Lens at (3,5) — distance would be 2, bringing them in range. From (4,4) I can precision_shot Lens.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(3,5) ✓
  💭 Orders say to attack my nearest ally next turn. My allies are Phantom @(2,2) dist=2 and Lens @(3,5) dist=2. Lens is critical (low HP), making them the priority target per orders. I need to get adjacent to attack. Lens is at (3,5) — I can move to (3,4) to get adjacent, then attack. However, I'm currently fortified. Moving will lose fortify, but orders require attacking an ally. Move to (3,4) then attack Lens at (3,5).
  State: Watcher 4/6, Longshot 3/4, Aegis 7/8, Phantom 3/4 | Dead: Veil, Lens

### Turn 5 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,2) ✓
  💭 Orders say attack nearest enemy. Phantom is at (2,2) dist=2, Aegis at (3,4) dist=3. Phantom is closer. However, attack range is adjacent only (1 tile). Neither enemy is adjacent. I need to move closer to attack. Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Phantom at (2,2) — but Foresight shows Phantom used breach to (2,3) last turn, so Phantom may have moved. Current position shown is (2,2). If I move to (2,3) I'd be adjacent to Phantom and can attack. But wait — if I'm adjacent to Phantom (a Vector-class? No, Phantom is specter), scan is only blocked by adjacent Vector. Moving to (2,3) gets me adjacent to Phantom at (2,2) to attack. But Phantom moved via breach last turn to (2,3) — the current stated position is (2,2) so they're at (2,2) now. I'll move to (2,3) and attack Phantom at (2,2).
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(2,3) ✓
  💭 Watcher is adjacent at (2,3). I'm at (2,2) facing N, so Watcher is directly in front of me. Behind Watcher is (1,3) - I can reach that in 1 move. Breach cooldown is 1 turn so I can't use it. Shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Best play: move to (1,3) to get behind Watcher, then shadow_strike for 1 damage without breaking cloak. Wait - I'm not cloaked so shadow_strike won't help with cloak preservation. At 2HP I need to be careful. Watcher is healthy and adjacent. If I shadow_strike from current position it deals 1 damage. Or move to (1,3) behind Watcher then shadow_strike. Moving behind first is better positioning. Let me move to (1,3) then shadow_strike Watcher at (2,3).
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is adjacent at (3,4), which blocks precision_shot (adjacent enemy Vector rule). I need to move away first to enable precision_shot. Moving to (5,4) puts distance=2 from Aegis, enabling precision_shot. Then fire precision_shot on Aegis — didn't move before shooting but did move this turn, so 1dmg applies. Actually, the rule is 1dmg if moved this turn. Still worth it to deal damage and maintain range. Phantom is cloaked at dist=4, not immediate threat.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Orders say attack nearest ally next turn. My nearest ally is Phantom at (1,3). I need to get adjacent to Phantom to attack. From (3,4), I can move to (2,4) which puts me adjacent to Phantom at (1,3). Then I can attack Phantom. Moving will break fortify but orders require attacking an ally.
  State: Watcher 3/6, Longshot 3/4, Aegis 6/8, Phantom 2/4 | Dead: Veil, Lens

### Turn 6 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): attack(1,3) ✓ → move(3,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is wounded and adjacent at (1,3) — priority target. Attack Phantom to potentially finish it off. I'm adjacent to Aegis which blocks scan, but attack works fine. Phantom is wounded so attack could be decisive. After attacking Phantom, I could move away to avoid being adjacent to both enemies next turn, but orders say attack nearest enemy. Both are dist=1. Phantom is wounded so attack it first.
- **Phantom** (specter): move(2,3) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Watcher is wounded and I'm already behind them (west side, they face E). I can move to (2,3) which is adjacent and behind Watcher, then use breach to take control of them. This is the perfect setup: breach from behind while they're wounded, then their own actions can damage their allies or waste turns. Alternatively, shadow_strike keeps cloak but I'm not cloaked. Breach from (2,3) is the high-value play — wounded Watcher under my control is devastating. Move to (2,3), then breach Watcher.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Aegis is at (2,4) dist=3, in range for precision_shot (range≤2 tiles means max 2? wait, dist=3 is out of precision_shot range). Checking: precision_shot range≤2 tiles, Aegis is dist=3 — out of range. Orders mention focus fire on Lens at (3,4) but I see no Lens in current data. Phantom is critical but cloaked and out of range at dist=4. I should move closer to get Aegis or Phantom in precision_shot range (≤2). Moving to (4,4) puts me at dist=2 from Aegis (2,4) — that's exactly range 2, within precision_shot range. But Aegis has shield_wall facing S — I'm at (4,4) which is E of Aegis, so shield doesn't block me. No adjacent enemies after move so precision_shot not blocked. I haven't moved yet so full 2dmg. Best move: go to (4,4) then precision_shot Aegis.
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (2,4) with 5/8 HP, fortified. Phantom is critical at (2,3). Watcher and Longshot are both at dist=2, not adjacent. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (3,4) closes distance to both enemies and puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,4). After moving I lose fortify, but I can attack Longshot if I end up adjacent. Wait - (3,4) is in valid moves and Longshot is at (4,4), that's dist=1, so I can attack. I should move to (3,4) then attack Longshot. Also need to protect Phantom who is critical - shield_wall facing E could help but I need to be adjacent to Phantom first. Moving to (3,4) puts me away from Phantom. Alternatively move to (2,3)... not in valid moves list. Let me move to (3,4) and attack Longshot at (4,4) - aggressive push as ordered.
  State: Watcher 3/6, Longshot 2/4, Aegis 5/8, Phantom 1/4 | Dead: Veil, Lens

### Turn 7 — player
- **Watcher** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → attack(4,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 3HP, adjacent to both Aegis (3,4) and Phantom (2,3). Phantom is critical and already scanned. Aegis is healthy. Orders say move away from allies toward Longshot or attack if adjacent. Longshot is at (4,4). I can attack Aegis who is between me and Longshot, or move toward Longshot. Moving to (4,3) gets me closer to Longshot and away from Phantom. But first I should attack Phantom (critical) to potentially finish them off — they're a threat with breach ability that targeted me last turn. Actually orders say move toward Longshot/attack Longshot if adjacent. Longshot is at (4,4), not adjacent to me. I should move toward (4,4). Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Longshot at (4,4). Then I can attack Longshot. But wait — I'm an Oracle following enemy orders that say attack Longshot. Let me follow: move to (4,3), then attack Longshot at (4,4).
- **Phantom** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP - extremely vulnerable. Breach is exhausted. Watcher is wounded at (4,3) facing E - I'm already behind them. I can move to (3,3) which is directly behind Watcher (adjacent), then use shadow_strike to deal 1 damage while staying cloaked. Watcher is wounded so this could finish them. Moving to (3,3) first, then shadow_strike.
- **Longshot** (striker): move(5,4) ✓ → precision_shot(3,3) ✗ Out of range
  💭 I'm at 1HP — one hit kills me. Aegis is adjacent at (3,4), which blocks precision_shot (adjacent enemy Vector rule doesn't apply here — Aegis is a sentinel not Vector, but being adjacent means I can't use precision_shot safely). Phantom is critical at (3,3) — killing it is high value. I need to move away from Aegis first to get range, then use precision_shot on Phantom. Moving to (5,4) puts me at dist 2 from Phantom (3,3) — sqrt((5-3)^2+(4-3)^2)=sqrt(5)~2.2, actually dist=2 tiles away. Wait, dist is Chebyshev: max(|5-3|,|4-3|)=max(2,1)=2. So Phantom at (3,3) would be at dist 2 from (5,4). Aegis at (3,4) would be at dist 2 from (5,4) — no longer adjacent. Precision_shot at range ≤2 works. But I moved, so it does 1dmg. Phantom is critical — even 1dmg should finish it. Move to (5,4) first, then precision_shot Phantom at (3,3).
- **Aegis** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → attack(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,4) with 5/8 HP, fortified. Both enemies are at distance 2 — Watcher at (4,3) and Longshot at (5,4). If I move to (4,4), I'll be adjacent to both Watcher and Longshot. Phantom is critical at (3,3) and needs protection. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Watcher for an attack, and I can shield_wall East to cover Phantom from Longshot's direction. Let me move to (4,4) then attack Watcher.
