## Squads
### Player
- **Lens** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Snare** (vector): "Control chokepoints with traps. Place them between enemy positions and your allies. Use denial to block adjacent enemy abilities. Pulse groups when possible."
### Opponent
- **Wraith** (specter): "Cloak immediately on turn 1. Move toward the enemy medic or weakest target. Use shadow_strike when adjacent while cloaked. Use breach to sabotage high-value targets."
- **Viper** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Warden** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(2,1) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately per orders and tip. All enemies are far (dist 4-6), no threats adjacent. After cloaking, advance toward enemy lines. Warden at (2,5) is straight north, dist 4. Move to (2,4) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(2,3) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of scan range. I need to advance north to get within 4 tiles of enemies. Moving to (2,3) gets me closest while staying behind Veil at (2,4). From (2,3), Warden at (2,5) is dist=2, Viper at (4,4) is dist=3, Wraith at (0,5) is dist=4 — all in scan range. I'll move north then scan the highest-priority target, Viper (vector), to deny its info.
- **Wraith** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(2,4) ✗ Specter can move through but not end on occupied tile
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then move toward Lens (oracle) at (2,3) to close distance. Best move tile toward Lens is (1,4) or (2,4), getting me closer for next turn strike.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✗ Position occupied → attack(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Lens is only 2 tiles away at (2,3). I need to push forward to engage. Moving to (2,4) gets me adjacent to Lens at (2,3) — that puts them in melee range for an attack. Orders say push aggressively and attack when possible. I'll move to (2,4) then attack Lens directly.
- **Snare** (vector): move(1,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are far away. I should advance toward the center and place a trap on a chokepoint between enemy positions and my allies. Moving to (1,3) puts me closer to the action while (2,2) or (1,2) would be a good trap location to block enemy approach paths. I'll move to (1,3) first, then place a trap at (2,2) which is a natural chokepoint enemies might cross to reach allies at (2,3)-(2,4).
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies are out of range. Lens is at (2,3) dist=3, Snare at (1,3) dist=4. I should advance toward center to threaten with pulse/trap while staying at medium range. Moving to (3,3) puts me dist=2 from Lens (in range) and dist=3 from Snare. Then I can place a trap at (3,2) to cover the approach path between the two enemies and toward my backline.
  State: Snare 7/7, Veil 4/4, Lens 10/10, Warden 12/12, Wraith 4/4, Viper 4/7

### Turn 2 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,4) ✓ → scan(2,5) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper (vector) which means my scan is BLOCKED by DENIAL. I cannot scan effectively from here. Priority: move away from Viper's denial zone first, then scan Warden (sentinel) who is healthy and unknown. Moving to (3,4) gets me away from Viper and keeps Warden in scan range (dist would be ~2). Actually, let me check: from (3,4), Warden at (2,5) is dist=2, still in range. Viper at (3,3) would be dist=1 from (3,4) — still adjacent. Better to move to (4,4) — Viper at (3,3) is dist=2, no longer adjacent. Warden at (2,5) from (4,4) is dist=3, still in scan range (≤4). That breaks denial and lets me scan Warden.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,3) ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded and I'm already behind them from (3,4). Move to (3,4) to get behind Viper, then shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked. Warden is adjacent but facing S so not behind — skip for now. Viper is the priority target: wounded, behind position reachable, and shadow_strike keeps cloak.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining at (0,5). No enemies in reach this turn. Snare is at (1,3) facing N — behind tile is (1,2), not reachable this turn. I need to close distance while staying cloaked. Moving to (1,4) gets me closer to Snare while keeping cloak active. Next turn I can move to (1,2) to get behind Snare for breach or shadow_strike. Must stay at least 2 tiles from Snare to avoid Vector denial zone blocking abilities.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (3,3) with 3/7 HP, so I need to be careful. Snare (enemy vector) is at (1,3) distance 2 — if I move adjacent, my trap ability gets blocked. Lens (oracle) is at (4,4) distance 2. I should attack Snare or Lens while staying at range 2. Pulse hits all within 1 tile — no clustering right now. Best play: attack Lens at (4,4) since I have 2 enemies in range. Then consider moving to (4,3) to maintain pressure or reposition. Actually, let me attack Snare first to whittle down the enemy vector who is threatening my area. Then move to (4,3) to stay at range from Snare while being adjacent to where Lens was. Wait — Lens is at (4,4), if I move to (4,3) I'd be adjacent to Lens (dist=1), bringing Lens into denial range which is good. Let me attack Lens first (2 range), then move to (4,3) to put Lens in my denial zone.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 I need to place traps to control chokepoints. There's already a trap at (2,2). Warden is at (2,5) moving south, Viper at (4,3) moving east. I should move toward the center to intercept and place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer to both enemies while staying out of Viper's denial range (3 tiles away is safe). From (2,3) I can place a trap at (2,4) which is between Warden at (2,5) and my allies - a likely chokepoint on their approach path.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(3,4) ✗ Position occupied → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,5) with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Snare is at (2,3) distance 2 — moving to (2,4) would put me adjacent to Snare, which is dangerous (denial range). Instead I can move to (3,4) to advance toward Lens at (4,4) while staying out of Snare's denial range. From (3,4) I'm still not in melee range of enemies. Better to shield_wall first while fortified, facing S toward the enemy cluster (Snare is south of me at (2,3)), then advance. Actually: shield_wall requires an adjacent ally target. Wraith is at (1,4) — adjacent to my position (2,5)? Distance is sqrt(1+1)=1.41, not adjacent (adjacent means directly N/S/E/W). So Wraith at (1,4) is diagonal — not adjacent. No adjacent allies for shield_wall. I should move to (3,4) to push forward toward Lens, avoiding Snare's adjacency denial. From (3,4) I lose fortify but get closer. No ability targets in range from new position either. Move to (3,4) then wait to maintain pressure.
  State: Snare 7/7, Veil 4/4, Lens 10/10, Warden 10/12, Wraith 4/4, Viper 3/7

### Turn 3 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,3) ✓ → breach(4,3) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Viper is wounded and I can reach position (3,3) which is directly behind them. Move there and use breach to take control of the dangerous Vector unit.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,4) ✓ → scan(1,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper (4,3) which blocks my scan ability. Priority: escape the denial zone first, then scan Wraith who is unscanned. Move to (5,4) to break adjacency with Viper while staying in range of enemies. From (5,4) I can scan Wraith at (1,4) — distance is 4, exactly at range limit. Wait, Wraith is at (1,4), dist from (5,4) = |5-1|+|4-4| = 4, exactly in range. Scan Wraith to reveal their strategy.
- **Wraith** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → breach(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,4) cloaked with 1 turn of cloak remaining and only 1HP. I need to act carefully. Cloak expires after this turn so I must use it now. Snare is a vector that blocks my abilities if adjacent — I must stay at dist≥2 from it. Veil is another specter at (3,3) facing S, with behind tile at (3,4) which is reachable. Moving to (3,4) puts me behind Veil, adjacent for shadow_strike or breach. Veil is healthy but breaching them would be valuable — they'd obey me next turn. However I'm at 1HP so I need to be careful. Shadow_strike keeps cloak and deals 1dmg. Actually cloak expires end of this turn anyway. Let me breach Veil: move to (3,4) then breach Veil — but wait, Snare is at (2,3) and (3,4) is dist 2 from Snare, not adjacent, so no blocking. (3,4) to Snare at (2,3): dist = |3-2|+|4-3| = 2, safe. Breach Veil from (3,4) — I'd be behind them (Veil faces S, behind is N side... wait, behind means I'm on the tile they're facing away from. Veil faces S, so behind is to the N? No — behind means behind their back. If facing S, their back is to the N, so behind tile is (3,4) which is south of them... actually the data says behind tile for Veil is (3,4) and Veil is at (3,3) facing S. Facing S means looking south, back is north — but (3,4) is north of (3,3) in this coord system where y increases upward. Yes, (3,4) is behind Veil. This works. Breach Veil to make them obey me next turn — high value. I'll move to (3,4) then breach Veil at (3,3).
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(2,4) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) S ✓
  💭 Currently fortified at (2,5) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in melee range. Orders say push forward aggressively. Moving to (2,4) advances toward the enemy cluster (Snare at (2,3), Veil at (3,3)) while keeping me 1 tile from Snare's denial zone. After moving, I lose fortify but can set up shield_wall facing South to protect against the enemy cluster. Wraith is critical at (3,4) — shield_wall facing S or E could help. Moving to (2,4) then shield_wall S covers the approach from Snare at (2,3).
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(4,3) ✓ → move(5,3) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at (3,3) - perfect pulse target. Snare is at dist=2 so not adjacent, won't block abilities. Pulse hits all within 1 tile: Veil at (3,3) is 1 tile away. After pulsing, I should move to (5,3) to stay at range from enemies and potentially threaten Lens while keeping distance from Snare.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Wraith is at critical HP at (3,4) — pulse from current position (2,3) hits all units within 1 tile. Wraith is 2 tiles away so pulse won't reach. Attack Wraith at range 2 to finish it. Warden is adjacent at (2,4), denial is active against them. After attacking Wraith, move to (1,3) to avoid clustering and maintain trap at (2,2) as a barrier.
  State: Snare 7/7, Veil 3/4, Lens 10/10, Warden 9/12, Wraith 1/4, Viper 3/7

### Turn 4 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,5) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper (5,3) which blocks my scan ability via Denial. I need to move away first. Moving to (4,5) gets me out of Viper's denial zone and keeps me at range. From (4,5), Wraith at (3,4) is distance 2 — within scan range of 4. Wraith is critical health, already scanned. Better to scan Warden — already scanned too. All enemies already scanned. Priority then: move away from Viper's Denial zone, then recalibrate Veil (specter) at (3,3) — but (3,3) is not adjacent to (4,5). From (4,4), Veil at (3,3) would be distance ~1.4 — not adjacent (diagonal). From (4,4), Veil at (3,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. Recalibrate is adjacent only (orthogonal?). Let me reconsider. Move to (4,4): Veil is at (3,3) — diagonal, likely not adjacent for recalibrate. Move to (4,5): no allies adjacent. Move to (5,5): escapes denial. From (5,5), can I scan? Wraith at (3,4) dist = sqrt(4+1)=~2.2, in range. Scan Wraith — already scanned. Scan is still useful for damage (1dmg). Wraith is critical — 1 more dmg could finish them. Move to (5,5) to escape denial, then scan Wraith at (3,4) for 1 damage to potentially eliminate critical target.
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Orders say move away from allies and toward Lens (at 5,5), exposing myself. I'm at (3,3). Viper is at (5,3) facing E — I'm already behind it. I could breach Viper from (4,3) which is reachable and behind. But orders say to move toward Lens and expose myself. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Lens at (5,5) and away from ally Snare at (1,3). I should avoid (4,3) since that's adjacent to Viper and would block abilities. Let me move toward Lens — (4,4) is a valid move tile, closer to (5,5). Then wait as second action since I'm just repositioning per orders.
- **Snare** (vector): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(2,4) ✓
  💭 Warden (sentinel) is at (2,4), distance 2 - in range. I'm at (1,3). I should move to (2,3) to get adjacent to Warden, enabling denial to block sentinel abilities. Then I can attack for 1 damage. Alternatively, place a trap at (2,2) to catch movement toward my allies - but there's already a trap at (2,2). Moving to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Warden, denying their abilities (like shield_wall direction choices won't matter but scan/breach blocked). Attack from (2,3) is adjacent. Let me move to (2,3) first, then attack Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (2,3) and has DENIAL active blocking my abilities. I can still basic attack. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I'll attack Snare with basic attack (only thing that works in denial zone). I want to stay fortified so I shouldn't move — but if I don't move, fortify stays active giving 50% dmg reduction. Attack Snare, then wait to keep fortify.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,2) ✓ → pulse(5,4) ✓
  💭 I'm at (5,3) with 3HP. Veil(specter) is at (4,4) dist=2 and Lens(oracle) is at (5,5) dist=2 - both in range. Veil and Lens are adjacent to each other, making pulse ideal to hit both simultaneously. I should pulse at a tile between them or use my current position's AoE. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile, so if I pulse at (4,4) or (5,4), I can catch both. From (5,3), pulse range is 1 tile - I can pulse at (5,4) which is adjacent to both (4,4) Veil and (5,5) Lens. Wait - pulse targets a tile and hits all within 1 tile of THAT tile. If I pulse at (5,4): Veil@(4,4) is 1 tile away, Lens@(5,5) is 1 tile away - hits both! After pulse, I should move to safety or place a trap. With 3HP I'm fragile. Move to (5,2) to maintain distance, then pulse at (5,4) to hit Veil and Lens for 1dmg each.
  State: Snare 6/7, Veil 3/4, Lens 10/10, Warden 8/12, Viper 3/7 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 5 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → recalibrate(4,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Viper is wounded at (5,2), 3 tiles away — not adjacent so scan isn't blocked. Warden is healthy at (2,4). Foresight shows Viper will pulse toward (5,4) this turn, which is near my position. I should move away from (5,4) to avoid the pulse. Move to (4,5) to stay safe and maintain range. Then recalibrate Veil (specter) at (4,4) — adjacent from (4,5) — to boost their effectiveness against the wounded Viper.
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,3) ✓ → shadow_strike(5,2) ✓
  💭 Viper is wounded and priority target. I can reach (5,3) which is behind Viper at (5,2) — perfect for breach or shadow_strike. Move to (5,3) first, then shadow_strike Viper for 1dmg (keeps cloak if active, adjacent). This finishes or severely damages Viper. Viper is 3 tiles away so no denial blocking my abilities from current position, and (5,3) is adjacent to Viper.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(2,4) ✓ → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (2,4) - I'm denying their abilities already. I have a trap at (2,2). I should attack Warden for 1 damage since they're adjacent, and consider positioning. Moving to (3,3) keeps distance from Warden while maintaining denial pressure, and I can place a trap on a chokepoint. Actually, Warden is healthy and adjacent - attacking is good. I'll attack Warden then move to (3,4) to maintain pressure and block their path toward allies at (4,5) and (5,3).
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(5,2) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Veil (specter) is adjacent at (5,3) - extremely dangerous at dist=1. I'm at 2HP, critical danger. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile - that would hit Veil for 1dmg. But I need to survive. Moving away from Veil is priority. Valid moves: (5,4) gets me closer to Veil, (4,2) puts distance. Let me move to (4,2) to escape Veil, then pulse won't reach. Actually, Veil is at (5,3) dist=1 right now - I can pulse first to deal 1dmg to Veil, then move away to (4,2) or (4,1) to create distance. Pulse range is 1-tile AoE from current position, hits Veil. Then move to (4,1) to escape and reposition.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,4) with Snare adjacent at (3,4). Orders say push forward and attack when possible. Snare's denial zone blocks abilities but not basic attack. I should attack Snare first, then consider position. Moving would break fortify, but orders say push forward aggressively. Attack Snare now while fortified, then move toward the enemy cluster to maintain pressure.
  State: Snare 5/7, Veil 2/4, Lens 10/10, Warden 7/12, Viper 2/7 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 6 — player
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → breach(4,1) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 Viper is wounded at (4,1) facing S — behind tile is (4,2) which is reachable. I can move to (4,2) to get behind Viper, then use breach to take control of them. That's a high-value play: breach a wounded Vector, make them act against their own team. Move to (4,2) first, then breach Viper.
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(4,2) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Warden is adjacent at (3,5) — scan is blocked anyway when adjacent to vectors, but Warden is a sentinel. Key concern: I'm adjacent to Warden which is dangerous. Viper at (4,1) is at dist 4, within scan range but already scanned. My orders say recalibrate on damage dealer and stay behind allies. Veil is my specter damage dealer at (4,2), wounded. I should move away from Warden to safety, then recalibrate Veil to boost their effectiveness. Moving to (5,5) puts me at dist 2 from Warden (safe) and dist 3 from Veil at (4,2) — adjacent range only for recalibrate so I need to be next to Veil. Veil is at (4,2). To recalibrate I need to be adjacent. From (5,3) I'd be adjacent to Veil's predicted position (5,2) after their move. Foresight shows Veil moves to (5,3) then shadow_strikes (5,2). So Veil will end at (5,2) after their action. I should move to (5,3) — adjacent to where Veil will be at (5,2). But turn order: Veil acts before me (spd3 tied, Veil already checked). So Veil has already moved to (5,3) and struck (5,2). Veil's final position after their turn = (5,3) (they move there first). Wait — Foresight shows last turn's actions. This round Veil may act differently. Regardless, I need to get adjacent to Veil at (4,2) current pos. (5,3) is adjacent to (4,2)? dist = sqrt(1+1)=1.4, not adjacent (only cardinal). (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2) — yes! Move to (4,3), then recalibrate Veil at (4,2). That gets me away from Warden and adjacent to Veil.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(4,2) ✓ → move(5,0) ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,1) with 2HP - critically low. Veil (wounded specter) is adjacent at (4,2) and Lens (oracle) is at (4,3). Both are in range. Pulse hits ALL units within 1 tile - that would hit Veil at dist=1 and potentially hurt me more since I'm already at 2HP. Better to attack Veil directly for 1 dmg (they're wounded, might finish them). Then move away to survive. Actually, pulse hits Veil AND Lens if I position right - but it also hits allies in range. At 2HP I need to be careful. Let me attack Veil (wounded, adjacent) to try to finish them, then move to (5,0) to get distance from Lens and Snare. Alternatively, place a trap on (4,2) to block Veil... but Veil is already there. I should attack Veil first (they're wounded and adjacent), then move to safety at (5,0).
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,5) ✓ → trap(2,5) ✓
  💭 Warden (sentinel) is adjacent at (3,5), wounded. My denial passive already blocks some of their abilities. I can attack Warden for 1dmg to potentially finish them off, and I'm not adjacent to an enemy Vector so I can place a trap. Place trap at (2,5) to block flanking routes toward allies, then attack Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Snare is adjacent at (3,4) to my north, with DENIAL active blocking my shield_wall. I can still use basic attack. Orders say attack when possible. I'm fortified (50% dmg reduction) but moved last turn at speed 1 so fortify may have dropped — status shows fortified though. Attack Snare directly since it's in range. After attacking, I'll wait to keep fortify for next round rather than moving into a worse position.
  State: Snare 4/7, Veil 1/4, Lens 10/10, Warden 6/12, Viper 2/7 | Dead: Wraith

### Turn 7 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(4,2) ✓ → move(5,4) ✓
  💭 Both enemies already scanned. Veil is critical at (4,2) and Viper attacked her last turn — she needs support. I should recalibrate Veil to boost her effectiveness, but she's at (4,2) which is adjacent to me at (4,3). I can recalibrate her in place. Then I need to stay safe — Warden is at (3,5) distance 3, Viper at (5,0) distance 4. No new scan targets needed since both enemies are already known. Recalibrate Veil (critical damage dealer) to help her, then wait or reposition. Moving to (5,4) would keep me at range and away from Viper.
- **Veil** (specter): move(5,1) ✓ → breach(5,0) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at 1HP — extremely fragile. Warden is the priority target but is 4 tiles away and I can't reach them this turn. Viper is wounded at (5,0) facing S, and (5,1) is directly behind them — I can reach it and use breach to take control of Viper (a wounded vector). That's a high-value play: breach a wounded enemy to neutralize them and potentially use them against Warden. Move to (5,1) then breach Viper — I'm behind them at adjacent range, breach should work. I'll order Viper to move away or attack Warden.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(5,1) ✓ → move(4,1) ✓
  💭 Veil is critical and adjacent at (5,1) - attack to finish. Then move to (4,1) to reposition and maintain denial pressure on Snare approaching from (3,4).
- **Snare** (vector): attack(3,5) ✓ → move(2,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (3,5) and wounded. I'm at (3,4) with 4HP. I can attack Warden for 1dmg, and there's already a trap at (2,5). Warden is wounded so finishing it off is priority. Attack first, then consider positioning. If Warden survives, I need to stay adjacent to maintain denial. Moving to (2,4) would keep me near the chokepoint and let me place a trap on the path between Viper and our position. But first, attack the adjacent wounded Warden.
- **Warden** (sentinel): move(4,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (3,5) with 50% damage reduction. Snare is 2 tiles away at (2,4) — I must not move adjacent or my abilities get blocked. Lens is at (5,4). Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. Moving to (3,4) gets me closer to Snare (adjacent would be bad, but (3,4) is diagonal to (2,4) — dist=1 diagonally but game uses Chebyshev? Let me check: (3,4) to (2,4) = dist 1, that's adjacent. Better to move to (4,4) — dist from (4,4) to (2,4) = 2, safe. From (4,4) I can shield_wall facing W toward the enemy cluster (Snare at (2,4), Lens at (5,4)). Actually Lens is to my E at (5,4) from (4,4). The enemy cluster: Snare is W, Lens is E. Shield_wall facing W protects from Snare direction. Moving loses fortify but orders say push forward aggressively.
  State: Snare 4/7, Lens 10/10, Warden 5/12, Viper 2/7 | Dead: Veil, Wraith

### Turn 8 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(5,3) ✓ → scan(4,1) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (4,4) — scan is not blocked by vectors when adjacent (that's only Vector's denial). Both enemies are in range. Warden is already scanned, Viper already scanned. Priority: move away from Warden who is adjacent and dangerous, then recalibrate Snare to boost damage output. I should move to (5,3) to gain distance from Warden, then recalibrate Snare at (2,4) — but Snare is not adjacent to my destination. Actually recalibrate range is adjacent only, so I need to be next to Snare at (2,4) which is too far. Better to move away from Warden first to (5,3) or (4,5), then scan Viper again isn't needed. I could scan Warden for 1 damage since both are already known. Move to (5,3) to step back from Warden, then scan Viper at distance 4+1=5 from (5,3)... Viper at (4,1): dist from (5,3) = |5-4|+|3-1|=3, in range. Scan Viper for 1 damage. That's useful — deals damage and Viper is wounded.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(4,4) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(3,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is wounded at (4,4), distance 2 - in attack range. I already have traps at (2,2) and (2,5). I should attack Warden to finish it off while it's wounded. My denial passive blocks adjacent enemy abilities, but Warden is at dist 2. I can move to (3,4) to get adjacent and apply denial, then attack. Or attack now from (2,4) at range 2, then move closer. Attacking from current position first, then moving to (3,4) to apply denial and potentially finish next round if still alive.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Snare in a DENIAL zone, so only basic attack and movement work. Snare is wounded and right next to me at (3,4). I should attack Snare to finish them off. I'm fortified so I have 50% damage reduction, which is good. After attacking, I'll hold position to maintain fortify for next round or move toward Lens.

### Turn 9 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(4,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is already scanned — prompt known. No new scan needed there. Snare is wounded and adjacent to Warden — it needs help. I should recalibrate Snare to boost its effectiveness against Warden. Snare is at (3,4), I'm at (5,3). Not adjacent. I need to move closer to recalibrate. Moving to (4,3) puts me adjacent to Snare at (3,4) — distance 1, so recalibrate works. That also keeps me away from Warden at (4,4) — I'd be diagonal, distance ~1.4, not adjacent. Safe. Then recalibrate Snare with addendum about Warden's aggressive shield_wall tactic.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(4,4) ✓ → pulse(4,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is adjacent at (4,4), wounded. I'm at 3HP so need to be careful. My Denial passive already blocks some of Warden's abilities. I should attack Warden directly since it's adjacent and wounded - could finish it off. Lens is also nearby at (4,3) so Warden is caught between us. Attack first, then if Warden survives, pulse to hit it (pulse hits all within 1 tile, range 1 AoE - Warden is at dist 1 so it would be hit). Actually pulse targets a tile and hits all within 1 tile of that tile - need to check. Attack is simpler and guaranteed. After attacking, I can pulse targeting (4,4) or move to safety.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(4,3) S ✓
  💭 I'm at 3/12 HP, fortified with 50% damage reduction. Two enemies adjacent: Snare (wounded vector) at (3,4) and Lens (oracle) at (4,3). I'm in Snare's denial zone so only basic attack/movement work against it. Priority: attack Snare to finish off the wounded unit. If I move I lose fortify, so staying put is better. I can attack Snare with basic attack (it's adjacent), then use shield_wall facing West or South to cover the enemy cluster. Actually, since I'm in denial zone, I should just attack Snare first. Shield_wall should face toward Lens (South from my position? Lens is at (4,3) which is directly south of me at (4,4), so direction S). Attack Snare, then shield_wall facing S toward Lens.

### Turn 10 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): move(3,3) ✓ → recalibrate(3,4) ✓
  💭 Warden is critical and adjacent (4,4). I already know its prompt. Snare attacked and pulsed Warden last turn — it may be nearly dead. I need to stay safe and support. I'm adjacent to Warden which blocks scan. I should move away to maintain range advantage, then recalibrate Snare to boost their damage output. Move to (3,3) to get distance from Warden, then recalibrate Snare at (3,4) which will be adjacent.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at (4,4) with 3HP, fortified, adjacent to Snare (wounded vector) in denial zone. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. Snare is at (3,4) distance 1 — in melee range. However, denial zone blocks abilities except basic attack/movement. I can attack Snare with basic attack (that works in denial zone). If I stay put (no move), I keep fortify passive for 50% damage reduction which is critical at 3HP. Attack Snare first, then wait to maintain fortify.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(4,4) ✓ → trap(4,3) ✓
  💭 Warden is at (4,4), distance 1, critical HP. I'm at 1HP so I need to finish this fast. Attack Warden to eliminate it. Then place a trap at a chokepoint for future control.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Lens** (oracle): recalibrate(3,4) ✓ → move(2,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Warden will attack (3,4) where Snare is — critical ally. Snare will attack Warden and step into trap at (4,3). Warden is already scanned, prompt known. I should recalibrate Snare to boost their attack on the critical Warden, then stay safe. Snare is at (3,4) — adjacent to me, so recalibrate is valid. After recalibrating, I can move to maintain positioning away from the frontline.
- **Snare** (vector): attack(4,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Warden is critical at (4,4), distance 1. I'm at 1HP so I need to finish this now. Attack Warden to eliminate them. Then I can place a trap or wait.
- **Warden** (sentinel): attack(3,4) ✓ → shield_wall(3,4) W ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP critical but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Snare is adjacent at (3,4) and in denial zone. I can still basic attack. Snare is critical so one hit might finish it. I should attack Snare first (basic attack works in denial zone), then shield_wall facing west to block Lens. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
