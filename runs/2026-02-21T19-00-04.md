## Squads
### Player
- **Viper** (vector): "Trap the paths enemies must take to reach your backline. Stay at medium range. Use pulse on clustered enemies. Denial blocks adjacent threats."
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): "Push forward aggressively. Shield_wall facing the enemy cluster. If flanked, turn to face the biggest threat. Attack when possible."
- **Marksman** (striker): "Maintain distance. Use precision_shot on high-value targets — medics first, then damage dealers. Use suppressing_fire if enemies close in."
### Opponent
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Patch** (medic): "Stay adjacent to the most threatened ally. Use patch on the most wounded teammate. If all healthy, use overclock on your damage dealer."
- **Phantom** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): cloak(0,5) ✓ → move(1,4) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. All enemies are far away (dist 6+). After cloaking, move toward center to advance behind enemy lines next turn. Moving to (1,4) gets me closer while staying safe.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(2,2) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is in range at dist=3 from current position (2,1). Orders say medics first. precision_shot has range≤2, so dist=3 is out of range. I need to move closer. Moving to (2,3) puts me at dist=1 from Patch at (2,4) — adjacent, which blocks precision_shot. Moving to (2,2) puts me at dist=2 from Patch — within range and not adjacent, so precision_shot works. But I need LoS and must not be adjacent. (2,2) to (2,4) is dist=2, not adjacent — precision_shot fires for 2dmg (no movement penalty if I shoot after moving... wait, 1dmg if moved). I moved, so it's 1dmg. Still worth it to hit the medic. Let me move to (2,2) then use precision_shot on Patch at (2,4).
- **Patch** (medic): overclock(1,4) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 All allies are at full HP, so no healing needed. Marksman is closest enemy at dist=2, threatening my allies. Orders say to use overclock on damage dealer if all healthy. Phantom (specter, spd3) is my damage dealer. Phantom is at (1,4), I'm at (2,4) - adjacent. I'll use overclock on Phantom to boost their next turn damage output. Then move toward the threat to stay positioned.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) N ✓
  💭 Push forward toward the enemy cluster. Patch is at (1,3), dist 3 — move to (1,2) to close distance. Then shield_wall facing North to protect allies from the enemy cluster ahead.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, no enemies in range yet. Move forward to (2,3) to close distance and position between allies and enemies. Patch is at (1,3) and Phantom at (1,4) — I should anchor the front line. From (2,3) I'll be closer to Marksman at (2,2) and can threaten next turn. No adjacent enemies so no attack possible; I'll wait as second action.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(2,3) ✗ Position occupied
  💭 Round 1, enemies are at distance 4-5. I should move forward to get into position and lay a trap on a chokepoint they'll likely cross. Rampart at (2,3) and Patch at (1,3) will likely advance south. Moving to (3,2) puts me closer while staying out of immediate danger. Then I'll trap (2,2) — a tile my allies occupy now but enemies will pass through, or better (3,3) to block the central approach corridor.
  State: Bulwark 12/12, Viper 7/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 12/12, Patch 9/10, Phantom 4/5

### Turn 2 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(1,1) ✓ → shadow_strike(1,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining and overclocked (2 ability uses). Bulwark is at (1,2) facing N, and I can reach the tile behind them at (1,1) which is adjacent and valid for breach/shadow_strike. Moving to (1,1) puts me directly behind Bulwark. With overclocked I can use two abilities — shadow_strike keeps cloak, so I'll shadow_strike Bulwark first, then breach them to take control next turn. This is optimal: damage + control on the most threatening nearby enemy while staying cloaked.
- **Patch** (medic): move(0,2) ✓ → overclock(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent
  💭 Phantom is wounded at 4/5 HP and is 2 tiles away at (1,1). I need to move closer to heal. Moving to (1,2) would be adjacent to Bulwark enemy — risky. Moving to (0,2) gets me 1 tile from Phantom at (1,1) — adjacent. But Bulwark is at (1,2) so (0,2) is not adjacent to Bulwark. From (0,2), Phantom at (1,1) is distance 2 — not adjacent. I need to be adjacent to Phantom to use patch. Phantom is at (1,1). Adjacent tiles: (0,1),(2,1),(1,0),(1,2). I can reach (1,2) but that's where Bulwark is. I can reach (0,2) in mv2 from (1,3). From (0,2) to (1,1) is dist=sqrt(1+1)=1.41 — not adjacent in grid terms (need same row/col or diagonal? No, this is grid — manhattan dist=2). Actually adjacent means dist=1 manhattan. (0,2) to (1,1): |0-1|+|2-1|=2. Not adjacent. What about moving to (0,3) then... no, one move. Can I reach any tile adjacent to Phantom (1,1)? Adjacent to (1,1): (0,1),(2,1),(1,0),(1,2). From (1,3) with mv=2: to (0,1)=|1-0|+|3-1|=3 too far. To (2,1)=|1-2|+|3-1|=3 too far. To (1,0)=3 too far. To (1,2)=1 — yes reachable but Bulwark is there. Can't move to occupied tile. So I cannot reach Phantom this turn to heal. Best option: move toward Phantom to set up next turn heal. Move to (0,2) gets closer. Viper is at (3,2) dist=3, safe. No heal possible this turn. Maybe overclock Rampart who is adjacent at (2,3)? But orders say patch most wounded. Can't reach Phantom. Move to (1,4) or (0,2) to reposition. Actually, let me check (0,2): from (1,3), dist=|1-0|+|3-2|=2, reachable. From (0,2), Phantom at (1,1) dist=|0-1|+|2-1|=2, still not adjacent. Hmm. Bulwark is blocking (1,2). No path to get adjacent to Phantom this turn. Move toward Phantom, then next turn heal. Move to (0,2), and wait or overclock Rampart (adjacent at (2,3), dist=|1-2|+|3-3|=1 — adjacent). Overclock on Rampart could help. But orders prioritize patch on wounded. Since I can't patch Phantom this turn, overclock Rampart as fallback.
- **Marksman** (striker): suppressing_fire(2,3) ✓ → move(4,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent (dist=1), which blocks precision_shot. Priority target is Patch (medic, dist=2). I need to move away from Rampart first to enable precision_shot, then shoot Patch. Moving to (2,4) increases distance from Rampart and keeps Patch in range at dist~2. From (2,4), Patch at (0,2) is dist=sqrt(4+4)≈2.8 — likely out of range 2. Better: move to (3,3) — Patch at (0,2) dist=sqrt(9+1)≈3.2, also out. Move to (2,1) — Patch at (0,2) dist=sqrt(4+1)≈2.2, out of range 2. Move to (3,1) — Patch at (0,2) dist=sqrt(9+1)≈3.2, out. Actually Patch is at dist=2 from current (2,2), so Manhattan dist=2. From (2,4): Rampart at (2,3) dist=1 still adjacent. From (3,3): Rampart at (2,3) dist=sqrt(1+0)=1, still adjacent. From (1,3): Rampart at (2,3) dist=1. From (4,2): Rampart dist=2, Patch at (0,2) dist=4, out of range. I need to escape Rampart and still hit Patch. Patch priority is highest. Use suppressing_fire on Rampart to slow them, then I can reposition next turn. Current pos: Rampart adjacent blocks precision_shot. Use suppressing_fire targeting Rampart at (2,3) — 1dmg in 2-tile line, slows movement. Then move to (4,2) to escape adjacency.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at dist=2, within my Denial passive range if I move closer. I can place a trap on a tile Rampart or Patch must cross to reach our backline. Tile (2,2) is a choke point between enemies and our allies. Move to (3,3) to maintain medium range, then trap (2,2) to deny that approach path. This keeps me out of Rampart's melee while setting up area denial.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(3,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm adjacent to Viper (denial zone) so only basic attack/movement work. Viper is at (3,3), distance 1 — I can attack. I'm fortified (50% DR) and suppressed (mv1). Staying put preserves fortify bonus. Attack Viper to apply pressure and deny their denial zone next turn.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(0,2) ✓ → shield_wall(2,2) E ✓
  💭 Patch is adjacent at (0,2) — attack for immediate value. I'm fortified so staying in place preserves 50% damage reduction. After attacking Patch, use shield_wall facing East toward Rampart at (2,3) to protect allies Viper and Marksman from that direction.
  State: Bulwark 11/12, Viper 6/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 11/12, Patch 8/10, Phantom 4/5

### Turn 3 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): shadow_strike(1,2) ✓ → move(3,2) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 1 turn remaining and already behind Bulwark at (1,2). I can shadow_strike Bulwark from my current position (1,1) since I'm adjacent and behind — shadow_strike preserves cloak. Then I should move toward (3,2) to get behind both Viper and Marksman for a breach next turn. Shadow_strike first, then move to (3,2) which is behind Viper.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,2) ✓ → precision_shot(3,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (3,2), which blocks precision_shot. Orders say maintain distance. I should move away to (5,2) or (5,3) to create range, then use precision_shot on Phantom. Moving to (5,2) keeps me at dist 2 from Phantom, enabling precision_shot. Patch is the priority but out of range at dist 4. Phantom is the closest threat and in range after repositioning.
- **Patch** (medic): move(1,3) ✓ → patch(2,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is critically wounded at 3HP (3/5), but not adjacent. Bulwark is adjacent and threatening. I need to reposition to reach a wounded ally. Moving to (1,3) gets me closer to Rampart at (2,3) - dist 1 - and lets me heal them next turn, while escaping Bulwark's adjacency. Actually, let me check: (1,3) is a valid move tile and dist to Rampart@(2,3) would be 1 (adjacent). I can't reach Phantom (dist 3 away). Rampart is wounded (11/12) and I can reach them. Move to (1,3) to be adjacent to Rampart, then patch Rampart.
- **Viper** (vector): pulse(3,3) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent (dist=1) to my west, Phantom is adjacent (dist=1) to my south - both in denial range. Pulse hits all units within 1 tile, which would hit both Rampart (1,2→no wait at 2,3) and Phantom (3,2). Phantom is already wounded - pulse could pressure them both. After pulse, I should move to maintain area denial and avoid being sandwiched. Moving to (4,3) gets me away from the cluster while keeping range on enemies.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) N ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is adjacent at (1,3) — prime target for melee attack. After attacking, I can shield_wall North to protect against Rampart at (2,3) and the enemy cluster. Staying in place preserves Fortify if I don't move.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(1,3) S ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies are adjacent so I can't attack. Bulwark is at (1,2) dist=2, Viper at (4,3) dist=2. Patch is at (1,3) to my west. I should hold position to keep fortify active and use shield_wall to protect Patch from Bulwark which is to Patch's south. Staying put preserves fortify bonus and lets me shield_wall toward the south to cover Patch against Bulwark.
  State: Bulwark 10/12, Viper 6/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 11/12, Patch 7/10, Phantom 2/5

### Turn 4 — player
- **Phantom** (specter): move(4,2) ✓ → breach(5,2) ✗ Cannot use breach — adjacent to enemy Vector (Denial)
  💭 I'm at 2HP so I need to be careful. Viper at (4,3) is 2 tiles away and blocks cloaking/breach if adjacent. Marksman at (5,2) is dangerous and I'm behind them. I can move to (4,2) which is behind Marksman and adjacent - then use breach to take control of Marksman, turning their firepower against the enemy team. Breach is ready and this is the perfect opportunity - Marksman is isolated, I'm behind them, and controlling them for a turn could be devastating. Viper is 2 tiles from (4,2) so I won't be adjacent to Viper.
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → precision_shot(4,2) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,2) — precision_shot is blocked when adjacent to enemy. I can move away first to create distance, then shoot. Moving to (5,3) puts me 2 tiles from Phantom at (4,2), enabling precision_shot. Phantom is wounded so this could finish them off.
- **Patch** (medic): move(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Phantom is critically wounded at 1/5 HP but is 4 tiles away — out of reach. Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) with 11/12 HP — barely wounded, low priority. Bulwark is adjacent at (1,2), threatening. I have 2 heals left. Phantom desperately needs healing but I can't reach them this turn. Best play: move toward Phantom to close distance, but I need to stay away from Viper. Moving to (2,4) keeps me adjacent to Rampart and moves me slightly toward Phantom without getting closer to Viper. Actually, Rampart only needs 1 HP healed — not worth a patch use. I should move toward Phantom. Moving to (3,3) gets me dist=2 from Phantom. But Viper is at (4,3) — moving to (3,3) puts me 1 tile from Viper, which would block my abilities. Avoid that. Move to (2,4) — dist to Phantom becomes 3, dist to Viper stays safe. Then I can attack Bulwark or wait. Actually with Bulwark adjacent, I could attack it. But saving actions to heal Phantom next turn is priority. Move to (2,4), then attack Bulwark is not worth it vs healing priority. Wait as second action.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(4,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 Phantom is adjacent at (4,2) and critical - attack to finish them off. Rampart is at distance 2, in range. After killing Phantom, I can use pulse to hit Rampart if they're adjacent, but Rampart is at (2,3) which is distance 2 - pulse only hits within 1 tile. Better to attack Phantom to eliminate the critical threat, then trap a key path to slow Patch/Rampart approach.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): shield_wall(2,4) E ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. No enemies in attack range. Bulwark is at (1,2) dist=2, Viper at (4,3) dist=2. Patch is at (2,4) behind me. Moving to (1,3) closes distance on Bulwark and keeps me between allies and enemies. From (1,3) I can shield_wall toward Viper (E direction) to protect against ranged threats, or I can move to (3,3) to get between Viper and allies. However, moving will break fortify. Best play: stay fortified, use shield_wall toward east to block Viper/Marksman threats on Patch.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → attack(2,3) ✓
  💭 I'm at (1,2) fortified with 50% damage reduction. Rampart is at (2,3) distance 2, Patch at (2,4) distance 3. Orders say push forward aggressively and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. If I move to (2,2) I get adjacent to Rampart at (2,3) and can attack. But (2,2) is a trap tile - avoid that. Moving to (1,3) puts me closer without the trap, then I can shield_wall N to protect allies from the enemy cluster. Actually, moving to (2,1) avoids the trap and stays safe. Let me move to (1,3) - that's distance 1 from Rampart at (2,3) diagonally, but melee requires adjacent. Better: move to (2,2) is a trap. Move to (1,3) gets me adjacent to Rampart? Rampart is at (2,3), (1,3) is distance 1 away - yes adjacent! I can attack after moving there.
  State: Bulwark 10/12, Viper 6/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 10/12, Patch 7/10 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 5 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,4) ✓ → precision_shot(2,4) ✓
  💭 Patch (medic) is highest priority but out of range at dist=4. Rampart (sentinel) is in range at dist=3. Orders say medics first, but Patch is out of range. I should move closer to get Patch in range while staying safe. Moving to (4,4) gets me closer to Patch at (2,4) — dist would be 2, bringing Patch in range. From (4,4) I can precision_shot Patch. Check trap at (3,3) — avoid it. (4,4) is safe. Move to (4,4) then precision_shot Patch at (2,4), dist=2, no movement penalty since I moved before shooting... wait, precision_shot deals 1dmg if moved. Still worth hitting the medic for 1dmg. Actually let me reconsider: move to (3,3) is a trap. (4,2) gives dist=2 to Patch at (2,4)? No, dist from (4,2) to (2,4) = |4-2|+|2-4|=2+2=4. (4,4) to (2,4) = |4-2|+|4-4|=2, in range. Moving to (4,4) then precision_shot Patch for 1dmg (moved penalty). Good trade — medic is high value.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded at 10/12 HP and adjacent to me at (2,3). I'm currently at (2,4) facing north. I need to patch Rampart. I'm already adjacent to Rampart, so I can use patch directly without moving. Patch heals an adjacent ally 2HP. After patching, I'll wait or stay in position to protect Rampart.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) E ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with Bulwark adjacent to my west. Patch is wounded behind me at (2,4). Priority: attack Bulwark since it's adjacent, then use shield_wall to protect Patch from eastern threats (Viper at (4,3), Marksman at (4,4)). Staying put keeps fortify active. Attack first, then shield_wall east to protect against Viper/Marksman.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → trap(3,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3), distance 2 - in range for attack. There's already a trap at (3,3). I should place a trap to block enemy advance paths while maintaining pressure. Patch is wounded at (2,4) but out of range. Rampart is healthy and close. I can attack Rampart now for 1 damage, then consider positioning. Alternatively, place a trap at (3,2) or (3,4) to catch movement. Since (3,3) already has a trap, placing one at (3,4) would create a trap corridor. But I can attack Rampart who is in range at dist 2. Let me attack Rampart and then place a trap to cut off paths.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Rampart first, then use shield_wall facing East to protect allies Viper at (4,3) from Rampart's direction. Moving would lose fortify bonus, so stay put.
  State: Bulwark 9/12, Viper 6/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 11/12, Patch 6/10 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 6 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Patch (medic, wounded) is at dist=2 — priority target. I'm at (4,4), Patch at (2,4). I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals 2dmg. Patch is wounded so this may finish them. Rampart is healthy sentinel, lower priority. Stay in place to avoid moving penalty on precision_shot.
- **Patch** (medic): patch(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) with 11/12 HP — wounded and needs heal. I'm at (2,4), Rampart is directly south at (2,3), so we're already adjacent. I have 1 patch use remaining. Patch Rampart now. Viper is 3 tiles away so no ability block. After patching, I can stay put or reposition — staying at (2,4) keeps me adjacent to Rampart.
- **Viper** (vector): move(5,3) ✓ → trap(4,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3) dist=2, in range. Patch is wounded at (2,4) dist=3, out of range. I have traps at (2,2), (3,3), (3,4). I should place a trap on a path enemies will use. Tile (3,2) is a valid move and not trapped - I could move there to block approach. But better: I can attack Rampart from current position (dist=2, within range=2). Actually my attack is adjacent only (range:adjacent). Pulse hits all within 1 tile. Rampart is at dist=2, so pulse won't reach. I can place a trap - but I'm not adjacent to an enemy Vector, so trap is available. Tile (3,3) is already trapped. I should trap (2,2) - wait, already trapped. Key paths: Rampart at (2,3) moving toward backline might go through (3,3) which is trapped. I should move to (3,2) to position between enemies and backline, then place trap at (2,2)... already trapped. Place trap at (3,2) after moving there? No - I'd be standing on it. Move to (5,3) to maintain range and safety, then trap a forward tile like (3,3)... already trapped. Trap (4,2) to block southern approach. I'll move to (5,3) staying safe at range, then trap (4,2) to block a corridor.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent to my east at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. I can attack Rampart now, then shield_wall facing E to block incoming from that direction while staying fortified. If I don't move, I keep fortify bonus — so I'll use ability first (attack Rampart), then shield_wall facing E to protect the line.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,4) W ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction active. Best play: attack Bulwark while fortified, then use shield_wall facing West to protect against further Bulwark attacks. Patch is behind me at (2,4) and needs protection. Staying put preserves fortify bonus.
  State: Bulwark 8/12, Viper 6/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 11/12, Patch 3/10 | Dead: Phantom

### Turn 7 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,4) ✓ → move(5,5) ✓
  💭 Patch (medic, wounded) is at (2,4), distance 2 — priority target per orders. I'm at (4,4) and haven't moved yet, so precision_shot will deal full 2dmg. I can shoot Patch first, then move to maintain distance. After shooting, I'll move to (5,5) to stay at range and keep distance from Rampart approaching from (2,3).
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,3) ✓ → trap(3,2) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3) distance 3, moving south toward our backline. I have traps at (2,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2) already placed. Rampart approaching from west - if they move east they'll hit (3,3) trap. I should move to (4,3) to get closer for denial range and pulse opportunities, then place a trap at (3,3)... wait, (3,3) already has a trap. Valid moves include (4,3). From (4,3) Rampart would be at dist 2, still not in my attack range (adjacent only). Let me move to (4,3) to apply Denial pressure and prepare, then place a trap at (3,2) to cover the corridor between existing traps - blocking the path from (2,3) eastward at y=2/3 level. (3,2) is reachable from (4,3) within trap range of 2.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → shield_wall(1,3) W ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction, so staying put is good. Attack Bulwark, then use shield_wall facing West to block Viper's threat vector for allies.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy cluster. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing East to block damage from Rampart's direction and protect allies.
  State: Bulwark 7/12, Viper 6/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 10/12 | Dead: Patch, Phantom

### Turn 8 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(5,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at distance 5, out of my range 2. No enemies in range from current position. Moving to (5,3) closes distance to Rampart to 3 — still out of range 2. Moving to (4,4) gets me to dist ~3. Best option is move to (5,3) to close gap slightly while maintaining elevated position, then wait since no targets are in range even after moving. Orders say maintain distance, so I should hold and not overextend toward a sentinel. I'll move to (4,4) to reposition closer but keep safe distance, then wait.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say push forward and attack when possible. Attack Rampart, then shield_wall facing East to protect allies from Rampart's direction.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3), dist 2, directly in range. I can attack for 1dmg. There are already traps at (3,3) and (3,2) blocking some paths. I should place a trap at a key approach path to protect backline - (3,4) already trapped. Rampart is healthy and close. I'll attack Rampart for damage, then move to (4,4) to maintain medium range and stay away from adjacency (which would block my trap ability).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Best move: attack Bulwark to press the advantage while staying put to maintain Fortify. No need to move.
  State: Bulwark 6/12, Viper 6/7, Marksman 5/5, Rampart 9/12 | Dead: Patch, Phantom

### Turn 9 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3), dist=3, in range for precision_shot. I'm at (5,3) and haven't moved yet, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. No need to move — maintain distance and fire.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing East to block any damage from Rampart's counterattack while protecting allies behind me.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded — attack to finish or weaken. I'm fortified so staying put preserves 50% damage reduction. Attack Bulwark, then wait to keep fortify.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(2,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3) dist=3, out of range. Heavy trap coverage already exists around center. My traps are at (2,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,2),(3,2) — good central coverage. Rampart approaching from west side. I should place a trap on a likely approach path. Moving to (3,5) or (4,5) to cover northern routes, then trap (2,4) or (2,5) to block Rampart's northern advance. Actually, let me move to (4,3) to get closer to deny Rampart's abilities if they close, and trap (2,4) — a tile Rampart might step through. But (2,4) is 3 tiles from (4,3), within trap range≤2? No, trap range is ≤2 tiles. From (4,4), (2,4) is dist=2, just in range. Place trap at (2,4) first, then move to maintain position.

- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is at distance 3, within my range 2? Wait - range 2 means ≤2 tiles. Rampart is at dist 3, which is out of precision_shot range. I need to close to distance 2 to use precision_shot. Moving to (4,3) would put me at dist 2 from Rampart at (2,3). But (3,3) is a trap. Moving to (4,3) - Viper is already there. Valid moves show (4,2) and (4,4) available. From (4,2): dist to (2,3) = |4-2|+|2-3| = 2+1 = 3, still out of range. From (5,2): dist to (2,3) = 3+1 = 4, worse. From (5,4): same. I can't reach range 2 of Rampart this turn with valid moves. Wait - recon says Rampart IS in range from current position (5,3). The range check says inRange:true for dist 3. Maybe range 2 means 2-tile range including diagonals? Or maybe it's Chebyshev distance? Chebyshev from (5,3) to (2,3): max(|5-2|,|3-3|) = max(3,0) = 3. Still 3. The recon explicitly says inRange:true, so I should trust it. Fire precision_shot at Rampart. Since I haven't moved, I get full 2dmg. Stay in position to maintain distance.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(2,3) ✗ Must be adjacent → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3), distance 2 - in range. I have 6 traps already placed. I can attack Rampart from current position. Moving to (3,3) would put me adjacent to Rampart, enabling Denial passive to block their abilities, but (3,3) already has a trap. I'll stay and attack Rampart from range 2, then move to (4,4) to maintain medium range and avoid clustering.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → shield_wall(2,3) E ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Orders say attack when possible and shield_wall facing enemy. I'll attack Rampart first, then shield_wall facing East to protect against Rampart's next attack while keeping fortify if I don't move.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded - attack it. I should not move to preserve fortify bonus. Viper is 3 tiles away so no denial risk from current position.

### Turn 11 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded at (2,3), distance 3, within precision_shot range (≤2 tiles means range 2... wait, dist=3 but inRange=true per recon data). I'm at (5,3), not adjacent to any enemy, so precision_shot is not blocked. I haven't moved yet so I get full 2dmg. Fire precision_shot on Rampart to eliminate or heavily damage the wounded sentinel. No need to move — current position is safe with distance maintained.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3), wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction at 4HP. Attack Rampart to finish them off — staying put preserves fortify. No need to move.
- **Viper** (vector): move(4,5) ✓ → trap(4,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3) wounded and dist=3. No enemies in range. The trap field is extensive already. I should look to place a trap on a path Rampart might use to advance, or reposition for better denial coverage. Valid moves include (3,4) and (3,3) - moving to (3,4) keeps me at medium range and activates Denial against Rampart if they push forward. From (3,4) I can place a trap. Looking at trap coverage: (3,3) already trapped. Rampart at (2,3) might move to (3,3) - already covered. They could go to (2,2) - trapped. Or (2,4) - trapped. Actually trap coverage is dense around Rampart. I should move to (4,5) to stay safe and place a trap on an uncovered approach tile like (4,4) or (5,3) near Marksman's position.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) and wounded. I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction active. Attacking Bulwark could finish them off or weaken further. I should stay put to keep fortify bonus and attack the adjacent wounded enemy.

### Turn 12 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded and in range at dist=3. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. Fire first, then wait or reposition. No need to move — maintaining distance is good at (5,3).
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent at (1,3) and critical — finish it with attack. I'm fortified so I should not move to keep 50% damage reduction active. Stay at (2,3) and attack Bulwark.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP but fortified (50% dmg reduction). Rampart is adjacent and wounded. I should attack to finish them off while keeping my fortified status by not moving. Staying put maximizes my survivability.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(2,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is at (2,3) wounded, dist=4. My traps are dense around (2-4, 2-4). Valid moves include (3,4) and (4,4) but those have traps already. I can move to (3,5) to reposition closer, then place a trap. Looking at trap coverage: (2,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,2),(3,2),(2,4),(4,4) already placed. The path from Rampart at (2,3) northward toward my backline - tiles (2,5),(3,5) are uncovered. Move to (3,5) to get closer, then trap (2,5) to block the northern approach route.

### Turn 13 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): precision_shot(2,3) ✗ Out of range → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded and in range at distance 3. I haven't moved, so precision_shot deals full 2dmg. I'm not adjacent to an enemy, so no blocking. Fire precision_shot on Rampart first, then hold position or reposition to maintain distance.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Bulwark is adjacent and critical - attack to finish them. I'm fortified so staying put maintains 50% damage reduction. No need to move.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 1HP but fortified with 50% damage reduction. Rampart is adjacent and wounded. I should attack to finish them off. Stay in place to keep fortify active, then attack Rampart at (2,3).
- **Viper** (vector): move(1,5) ✓ → trap(1,4) ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded at (2,3), dist=3, not in range. Bulwark is critical at (1,3). I have tons of traps already placed. The area around (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4) is well-covered. I should look for uncovered paths. Rampart at (2,3) might move toward our backline. Tile (1,4) or (1,5) could be approach vectors not yet trapped. I can move to (2,5) which is listed as valid but already has a trap - wait, (2,5) is a trap location so I shouldn't move there. Let me move to (4,5) to get better positioning, then place a trap on an uncovered tile. From (4,5) I could trap (3,5) or other tiles. Actually, looking at uncovered tiles near enemy paths: (1,4) seems uncovered. I can move to (2,5)... wait that has a trap. Move to (1,5) to be closer to Bulwark and deny approaches, then trap (1,4) to cover that corridor. But (1,5) is valid. From (1,5), trap range is ≤2 tiles so I can reach (1,4), (1,3) area. Place trap at (1,4) to protect Bulwark's flank.

### Turn 14 — player
- **Marksman** (striker): move(4,3) ✓ → precision_shot(2,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is wounded at (2,3), distance 3, within my range of 2... wait, dist=3 exceeds rng2. I haven't moved yet. If I move to (4,3), Rampart would be at dist=2, in range. I didn't move so precision_shot gets full 2dmg. Bulwark is critical at (1,3) adjacent to Rampart — taking out Rampart would relieve pressure. Move to (4,3) then precision_shot Rampart.
- **Bulwark** (sentinel): attack(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) and critical — one hit should finish them. I'm at 1HP so staying fortified is critical for survival. Attack Rampart first to eliminate the threat, then wait to keep fortify active.
- **Viper** (vector): trap(0,4) ✓ → move(3,5) ✓
  💭 Rampart is critical at (2,3) and dist=3. I'm at (1,5). Many traps already placed. (2,5) and (1,4) are already trapped. Valid moves include (3,5) which would bring me closer to range. Rampart is at (2,3) - I need range 2 to attack. Moving to (3,5) puts me at dist 2 from Rampart (|3-2|+|5-3|=3, still out). Move to (2,5) - already trapped. Move to (2,4) - already trapped. I can move to (0,4) or (0,5) but that retreats. Best: move to (3,5) to get closer, then trap (3,3) - already trapped. (2,3) where Rampart stands - can I trap occupied tiles? No. Rampart is critical, need to finish it. Move to (2,4) is trapped but I can still move there. Actually traps trigger on enemies stepping on them. Let me move to (3,5) to get within range 2 of Rampart at (2,3): dist = |3-2|+|5-3| = 3, still out of range. No good attack options. Trap (1,3) where Bulwark is - no, ally. Best play: trap a new untrapped tile to block retreat. (0,3) is untrapped. Move to (0,4), then trap (0,3) to block western escape. Or wait and trap nearby. From (1,5) I can trap within 2 tiles - trap (0,3) which is 3 away, too far. Trap (1,3) - ally there. Trap (2,4) already placed. Trap (0,4) from current pos (dist=1+1=2, valid). Move to (0,5) then trap (0,3). Actually from (1,5): trap range ≤2 tiles. (0,3) = dist 1+2=3, out of range. Best: trap (0,4) to cover western approach, then move.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 I'm at 2HP with Fortify active giving 50% damage reduction. Bulwark is adjacent and critical - I should attack to finish them off. After attacking, I should not move to keep Fortify active for defense against Marksman and Viper.
