But pulse only does 1dmg to all within 1 tile - not ideal with them at dist=2. Better to place a trap at (1,4) to catch Hawk moving south, then use pulse if they close in. Wait - (1,4) is a valid move tile so it's reachable but I'd be placing trap on my own tile area. Let me trap (1,4) to block Hawk's path south. I'm at (1,3), trap range is ≤2 tiles, so (1,4) is within range. This forces Hawk to take alternate routes. Seer at (2,4) - existing trap at (2,3) already covers that path.

Better to recalibrate Hawk - need to get adjacent first. Hawk is at (5,4), I'm at (2,4). Moving to (4,4) puts me adjacent to Hawk and still not adjacent to Warden at (4,5) - wait, (4,4) is adjacent to Warden at (4,5)! That would block scan and put me in danger. Move to (4,3) instead - adjacent to Hawk at (5,4)? No, (4,3) to (5,4) is distance 2. I need to be adjacent (dist 1) to recalibrate. Move to (4,4) is adjacent to Warden - bad. Move to (3,4) - adjacent to (4,4) but not Hawk. Actually recalibrate range is adjacent only. Hawk is at (5,4). To be adjacent I need to be at (4,4), (5,3), (5,5). (4,4) is adjacent to Warden too risky. Instead, scan Warden from current position for 1 dmg, stay safe.",
