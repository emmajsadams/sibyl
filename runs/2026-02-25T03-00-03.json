Veil at (2,5) is dist=1, which is adjacent - I should move away from Veil while staying in range of targets. Moving to (1,4) keeps me at range from enemies and away from Veil. From (1,4): Aegis at (3,3) would be dist=sqrt(4+1)~2.2 tiles - may be out of range 2. Let me check: precision_shot range is ≤2 tiles. Distance from (1,4) to (3,3) = sqrt((3-1)^2+(3-4)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.24 - out of range. Distance from (1,4) to (2,5) = sqrt(1+1) = ~1.41 - in range. Distance from (1,4) to (4,4) = sqrt(9+0) = 3 - out of range. So from (1,4) only Veil is in range. Stay at current position (2,4) - Aegis and Prophet are both at dist=2 and in range. Veil is at dist=1 but is a specter not Vector, so precision_shot works. Target Prophet (oracle) as the highest priority non-medic, or Aegis. No medic present. All are healthy.

I'll move to (5,4) first then (5,3) if possible — but I only have mv2 total. I can move to (5,3) in one move (dist=2 from 5,5). That puts me on the east edge, away from allies, isolated. Then wait.",

Attacking is only adjacent range so I can't attack from here. I could move to (4,3) to get adjacent, but Warden's shield_wall faces E — I'd be attacking into the shield. Better to move to (4,4) or (4,2) to flank, then scan isn't needed since prompt is known. Actually, scan deals 1 dmg and Warden is critical — a scan could finish it if it has 1HP left. Scan range is ≤4, Warden is at dist 2, so scan is valid. Let me scan Warden to deal damage and potentially finish it, then wait.",
