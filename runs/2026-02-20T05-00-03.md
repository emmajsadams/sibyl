## Squads
### Player
- **Veil** (specter): "Cloak and move behind enemy lines. Target isolated enemies with shadow_strike. Save breach for the most dangerous enemy. Avoid being caught uncloaked."
- **Bolt** (striker): "Position for clear sight lines. Prioritize killing wounded enemies with precision_shot. If forced to move, retreat away from threats. Suppressing_fire to slow rushers."
- **Prophet** (oracle): "Use scan to reveal enemy prompts and cloaked units. Stay at max range (≤4 tiles for scan). Use recalibrate on wounded allies to buff them. Keep distance from enemies and avoid adjacent vectors."
### Opponent
- **Seer** (oracle): "Scan priority targets each turn to reveal their strategy. Use recalibrate on your damage dealer to boost effectiveness. Stay behind allies and maintain range. Never get adjacent to enemy vectors."
- **Rampart** (sentinel): "Hold the front line. Position between allies and enemies. Use shield_wall toward incoming threats. Attack adjacent enemies."
- **Viper** (vector): "Place traps on tiles enemies are likely to move through. Use pulse if 2+ enemies are adjacent. Stay near allies for mutual support."

## Turns
### Turn 1 — player
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(2,1) ✓ → recalibrate(4,5) ✓
  💭 Prophet is exactly at scan range (dist=4). I should scan Prophet to reveal their strategy and deal 1 damage. Then recalibrate Viper (our vector damage dealer) to boost effectiveness. No need to move — current position works for both actions.
- **Veil** (specter): cloak(4,0) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 Round 1 — cloak immediately as instructed. Then advance toward Seer/Viper. Seer is at (3,4) facing S, behind tile is (3,5). I can't reach behind Seer yet (dist 5, mv 3). Best move is north toward (4,3) to close distance while cloaked.
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,4) ✓ → move(2,2) ✓
  💭 Both Rampart and Seer are exactly at scan range (dist=4). Seer is the enemy oracle - scanning them reveals their prompt and deals damage, which is high priority. I'll scan Seer first. I can then move to maintain positioning. No adjacent enemies so scan is not blocked.
- **Bolt** (striker): move(1,2) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 All enemies are out of range (dist 6+). I need to advance to get within range 2 for precision_shot. Moving to (1,2) gets me closer while staying away from Viper's denial zone. No enemies in range this turn, so I'll advance and wait.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Round 1, enemies are at dist 3-4, out of attack range. Orders say hold front line and position between allies and enemies. I'm at (2,5), allies are at (4,5) and (3,4). Enemies are to the south at (1,2) and (2,2). I should move south toward them to establish front line position. Moving to (2,3) puts me closer to both enemies and between them and my allies. Then I'll wait with Fortify passive active (if I don't use my full move allowance, I still get 50% dmg reduction if I didn't move - but I am moving). Actually, I should move to best defensive position. (2,3) gets me closer to Prophet at (2,2) - just 1 tile away. That's good for intercept/shield_wall. I'll move to (2,3) and wait to benefit from position.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,5) ✓ → trap(2,4) ✓
  💭 Enemies are at dist 5-6, out of range. I need to advance and set traps on likely enemy approach paths. Prophet and Bolt are moving north toward our position. Moving to (3,5) keeps me near allies while I place a trap at (2,4) - a likely chokepoint on the path between enemies and our team. This denies movement through a key tile.
  State: Bolt 3/3, Veil 4/4, Prophet 7/10, Rampart 12/12, Viper 7/7, Seer 7/10

### Turn 2 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): scan(3,5) ✓ → move(1,3) ✓
  💭 Rampart is adjacent at (2,3) — Viper placed a trap at (2,4) last turn, so I must avoid moving north toward (2,4). Rampart is adjacent which blocks scan (only vectors block scan, so Rampart doesn't block it). Seer already scanned me last turn and recalibrated. Priority: scan Viper at (3,5) to reveal prompt, then move away from Rampart. But Viper is at dist=4 and I'm adjacent to Rampart (sentinel, not vector) so scan is not blocked. I should scan Viper first, then move to (1,3) to maintain range and avoid the trap at (2,4).
- **Veil** (specter): move(4,5) ✓ → shadow_strike(3,5) ✓
  💭 I'm cloaked with 2 turns remaining. Viper is wounded and I can get behind it at (4,5) in 1 move. However, Viper at (3,5) facing W means (4,5) is behind it AND adjacent — perfect for breach or shadow_strike. But Viper blocks cloak/breach when adjacent. I should prioritize shadow_strike on Viper (keeps cloak) rather than breach. Moving to (4,5) puts me adjacent to Viper behind it — I can shadow_strike for 1dmg while staying cloaked. Rampart at (2,3) facing S has behind tile at (2,4) which is reachable. Let me go for Viper first since it's wounded — shadow_strike won't break cloak.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(1,2) ✓ → recalibrate(3,5) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Prophet scanned me at (3,4) last turn and moved to (2,2). Bolt stayed at (1,2). Viper placed trap at (2,4) — must avoid that tile. I should scan Bolt to reveal their strategy since Prophet is already known. Then recalibrate Viper (wounded, adjacent at (3,5)) to boost effectiveness. Current position (3,4) keeps Bolt at dist=4 in scan range. Scan Bolt first, then recalibrate Viper.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): attack(1,3) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is adjacent at (1,3). I'm fortified with 50% damage reduction. Attack Prophet, then stay put to maintain fortify bonus next turn.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,3) ✓ → trap(2,2) ✓
  💭 I'm wounded (3/7 HP) and no enemies in range. Valid moves exclude (2,4) which has a trap. I should advance while placing a trap on a chokepoint. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer to Prophet at (1,3) while staying near Seer at (3,4). From (3,3) I can place a trap at (2,3) — but Rampart is there. Better: move to (4,4) to stay back safely, then place trap at (3,3) to block enemy advance paths. Actually, moving to (2,5) keeps me near allies. Let me move to (3,3) to advance toward Prophet and place trap at (2,3)... wait Rampart is at (2,3). Place trap at (3,2) instead — that's within range 2 from (3,3) and on a likely enemy path. But I need to check if I'm adjacent to enemies before trapping — no enemies adjacent, so trap is valid. Move to (3,3), then trap at (3,2) to block Prophet's advance route.
  State: Veil 4/4, Prophet 6/10, Rampart 12/12, Viper 3/7, Seer 7/10 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 3 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(0,3) ✓ → scan(2,3) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Rampart will attack me at (1,3) this turn. I need to move away to avoid that attack. I'm at 6/10 HP already. Rampart is at (2,3) dist=1, so I must not stay here. Moving to (0,3) gets me away from Rampart's melee range. After moving, Seer is the priority scan target — enemy oracle at (3,4) dist=3 from (0,3) which is within scan range (≤4). But Viper is at (3,3) and I need to avoid being adjacent to it — moving to (0,3) keeps me well clear. From (0,3), Seer at (3,4) is dist=4, within scan range. Seer is already scanned though. Rampart hasn't been scanned yet — dist from (0,3) to Rampart at (2,3) is 2, within scan range. Let me scan Rampart to reveal their prompt.
- **Seer** (oracle): recalibrate(3,3) ✓ → move(4,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (0,3), distance 4, wounded and already scanned. Veil is moving to (4,5) and will shadow_strike (3,5) next turn — I should avoid (3,5). Viper is wounded at (3,3) — recalibrate would help but I need to be adjacent. Viper is adjacent to me at (3,3), so I can recalibrate. Actually, let me scan Veil (specter) who is cloaked and heading toward (4,5) — but I don't know Veil's current position. Prophet is the only enemy in range. I'll scan Prophet again? No, already scanned. Better to recalibrate Viper (wounded damage dealer) since they're adjacent at (3,3), then move away from (3,5) to avoid Veil's incoming shadow_strike. Move to (4,4) first to stay safe, then recalibrate Viper — but after moving to (4,4), Viper at (3,3) would be diagonal, not adjacent. Let me recalibrate Viper first (they're adjacent at (3,3)), then move to (4,4) to avoid (3,5) strike zone.
- **Veil** (specter): move(3,4) ✓ → shadow_strike(4,4) ✓
  💭 Cloak expires after this turn. Seer is adjacent at (4,4) facing E, so (3,4) is behind them and reachable. I can move to (3,4) which puts me behind Seer AND behind Viper. From (3,4) I can shadow_strike Seer (adjacent) while staying cloaked, dealing 1 damage to a healthy target. Alternatively I could breach Seer from behind for control. Seer is healthy so breach is more valuable than shadow_strike — but Viper is wounded and nearby. Best play: move to (3,4) to get behind Seer, then shadow_strike Seer (keeps cloak, deals damage). This preserves cloak for one more action and damages a healthy enemy.
- **Viper** (vector): attack(3,4) ✓ → move(4,3) ✓
  💭 I'm wounded at 3HP and Veil (specter) is adjacent at (3,4). Orders say move away from (3,5) and that Veil will shadow_strike there — but I'm at (3,3), not (3,5). Still, Veil is right next to me at dist=1 and healthy. I should attack Veil with my basic attack (1dmg) since they're adjacent, then move away to a safer position. Moving to (4,3) keeps me near Seer at (4,4) for mutual support and gets me away from Veil. I can't use trap because Veil is adjacent (Denial passive blocks it, and adjacency blocks trap). Pulse would hit Veil but also potentially Rampart at (2,3) — dist from me is 1, so Rampart would take damage too. Better to just attack Veil and reposition.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(3,3) ✓ → attack(3,4) ✓
  💭 I'm fortified at (2,3) with 50% damage reduction. Veil is at (3,4) dist=2, Prophet at (0,3) dist=2. No enemies adjacent. Allies Viper at (4,3) and Seer at (4,4) are wounded. If I move to (3,3), I get between allies and Veil at (3,4) — adjacent — and can attack. But moving loses Fortify. Better to stay fortified and use shield_wall toward N to protect allies from Veil's direction, or hold position. Actually Veil is to my NE at (3,4). If I stay, I remain fortified but can't attack anyone. I could move to (3,3) to get adjacent to Veil at (3,4) and attack, sacrificing fortify. Given allies are wounded and I need to be aggressive to protect them, moving to (3,3) puts me adjacent to Veil for an attack. That's better than waiting.
  State: Veil 2/4, Prophet 6/10, Rampart 10/12, Viper 3/7, Seer 6/10 | Dead: Bolt

### Turn 4 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,3) ✓ → scan(4,4) ✓
  💭 Seer is out of range at dist 5. Viper is wounded and at dist 4 — scan it to reveal updated strategy and deal damage. I already know Viper's prompt but scanning again deals 1 damage to a wounded enemy. Actually, both prompts are already known. Better to scan Seer but they're out of range. I should move closer to get Seer in range, but I need to avoid getting adjacent to Viper (vector denial). Moving to (1,3) keeps me at dist 3 from Viper (safe) and Seer would be at dist 4 — in range! Let me check: Seer @(4,4), from (1,3) = |4-1|+|4-3| = 3+1 = 4. Yes, exactly 4. Move to (1,3) then scan Seer to reveal their prompt and deal damage.
- **Seer** (oracle): move(4,5) ✓ → scan(3,4) ✓
  💭 Veil is adjacent at dist=1 which blocks scan. Foresight shows Veil will shadow_strike me at (4,4) this round. I need to move away from Veil first to escape the strike and clear scan block, then scan Prophet or Veil. Moving to (5,4) puts me at dist=2 from Veil (unblocked) and Prophet is still at dist=4+1=5 from new pos — out of range. Better move to (5,3): dist to Veil=2, dist to Prophet=sqrt(16+0)=4 still in range. Actually from (5,3): Prophet at (1,3) is dist=4, in range. Veil at (3,4) is dist=sqrt(4+1)=~2.2. Move to (5,4): Prophet at (1,3) dist=sqrt(16+1)~4.1 out of range. Move to (4,5): Prophet dist=sqrt(9+4)~3.6 in range, Veil dist=sqrt(1+1)~1.4 out of scan block. Scan Veil from (4,5) — dist to Veil(3,4)=sqrt(1+1)~1.4, not adjacent so scan unblocked. Good plan: move to (4,5), then scan Veil to reveal prompt and deal 1 damage to wounded Veil.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(2,3) ✓ → attack(1,3) ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (1,3), distance 2 to my west. I'm fortified (50% DR). Moving west to (2,3) puts me adjacent to Prophet for an attack, but I lose fortify. Better to advance to (2,3) to get adjacent and attack — the attack opportunity is worth losing fortify since I'm at full HP and Prophet is wounded. Viper is wounded at (4,3), Seer wounded at (4,5). I should position between allies and the enemy. Moving to (2,3) gets me adjacent to Prophet for an attack.
- **Viper** (vector): move(3,2) ✓ → trap(3,3) ✓
  💭 I'm wounded (3/7 HP) and need to control chokepoints. Prophet is at (1,3), dist=3, out of range. No enemies adjacent so pulse is wasteful. Orders say place traps on likely enemy movement paths and avoid (2,4) trap. Prophet is moving east, so I should anticipate their path. Moving to (3,3) gets me closer while staying safe, then placing a trap at (3,4) or along Prophet's likely approach path. Actually, let me move to (3,2) to approach while avoiding traps at (2,4) and (2,2), then place a trap at (3,3) to block Prophet's eastward advance. Wait - I can move to (3,3) and trap (3,4) to intercept. Prophet at (1,3) facing east could move to (2,3) or (3,3). Placing trap at (3,4) cuts off northern approach. Let me move to (3,2) and trap (3,3) — a chokepoint on Prophet's likely path.
  State: Prophet 5/10, Rampart 10/12, Viper 3/7, Seer 3/10 | Dead: Bolt, Veil

### Turn 5 — player
- **Prophet** (oracle): move(1,4) ✓ → scan(3,2) ✓
  💭 Foresight shows Rampart will attack me at (1,3) this turn. I need to move away. Seer is at distance 5, out of scan range. I should move to create distance from Rampart and try to get Seer in range. Moving to (0,4) gets me away from Rampart and Viper. Then I can scan Viper (dist ~4 from new pos) or move closer to Seer. Actually, let me move to (1,4) to stay mobile and scan Viper at (3,2) from (1,4) = dist 3, in range. Viper is wounded — scanning deals 1 more dmg. I already know Viper's prompt but scan still deals damage. Better: move to (1,4) then scan Viper to chip damage.
- **Seer** (oracle): scan(1,4) ✓ → wait ✓
  💭 Prophet is at (1,4) wounded and exactly 4 tiles away — within scan range. Foresight shows Prophet will move to (1,3) then scan (4,4), so after their move they'll be at (1,3) which is still in range. I should scan Prophet now to deal damage (already know their prompt but scan still deals 1 damage). Rampart is healthy so no recalibrate needed. Stay at (4,5) to maintain distance and range.
- **Rampart** (sentinel): move(1,3) ✓ → attack(1,4) ✓
  💭 Prophet is critical at (1,4), distance 2. I'm fortified at (2,3). If I move to (1,3), I'll be adjacent to Prophet at (1,4) and can attack. But moving will break Fortify. Prophet is critical so attacking to finish them is high value. Seer is wounded at (4,5) and not adjacent so shield_wall won't help them much. Moving to (1,3) puts me adjacent to Prophet for a kill shot. The trap at (2,4) and (2,2) are nearby but (1,3) is clear. Let's advance and attack.
  State: Prophet 1/10, Rampart 10/12, Seer 3/10 | Dead: Bolt, Veil, Viper
