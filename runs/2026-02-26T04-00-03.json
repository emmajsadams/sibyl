Actually I'm at (1,2). Foresight shows enemy Prophet recalibrate→(5,2) this turn. My best action: I have no new scan targets in range. Warden is critical — attack is only adjacent. I should recalibrate allied Prophet if adjacent. Allied Prophet is at same tile or adjacent? Orders say recalibrate on wounded allies. Since all enemies scanned and Prophet ally likely adjacent, I'll move to maintain safe distance and recalibrate ally Prophet. Move to (1,3) to check adjacency, or just recalibrate if Prophet is at (1,2) with me — but can't recalibrate self. Prophet ally was at (3,2) last turn and moved to (1,2) per Foresight. We're co-located. I'll move to (1,1) to stay safe and wait — no valid recalibrate target adjacent and no new scan targets. Best: wait and move to safer position away from Hawk at (4,2).",
